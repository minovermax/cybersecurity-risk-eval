{"cik": "1421561", "company": "China Shengda Packaging Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock is highly speculative in nature, involves a high degree of risk and should be purchased only by persons who can afford to lose the entire amount invested in our common stock. Before purchasing any of our common stock, you should carefully consider the following factors relating to our business and prospects. You should pay particular attention to the fact that we conduct all of our operations in China and are governed by a legal and regulatory environment that in some respects differs significantly from the environment that may prevail in the U.S. and other countries. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results will suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe may not be able to sustain our growth, and the continuation of growth may strain our resources.\nOur business has grown and evolved rapidly since our establishment, as demonstrated by our growth in revenue from $79.1 million in 2007 to $152.6 million in 2014. Our net income attributable to our common stockholders has increased from approximately $7.9 million in 2007 to $9.6 million in 2011. However, our net income attributable to our common stockholders decreased to $5.6 million in 2012, $2.7 million in 2013 and $2.6 million in 2014. We may not be able to achieve growth in future periods. Therefore, our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business, financial performance and prospects in the future. Our ability to achieve satisfactory operating results at higher sales volumes is unproven. In addition, our rapid expansion could significantly strain our resources, management and operational infrastructure, which could impair our ability to meet increased demand for our products and hurt our business results. You should not rely on our past results or our historical rate of growth as an indication of our future performance.\nWe are vulnerable to shortages in raw paper supply and electricity, and fluctuations in raw paper prices.\nThe main raw material used in manufacturing our paper cartons is raw paper. The cost of raw paper has historically constituted approximately 65% to 80% of our cost of goods sold. We source our raw paper in China.\nIn order to ensure timely delivery of quality products to our customers at competitive prices, we need to obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials at acceptable prices in a timely manner. We also require a significant amount of electricity in order to maintain our operations. We have not experienced any significant shortage in raw material supply or electricity thus far. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials of acceptable quality from our suppliers at acceptable prices in a timely manner or that we will not suffer from electricity shortages in the future.\nFurthermore, as raw paper is a commodity, we are vulnerable to the risk of rising raw paper prices, which are determined by demand and supply conditions in the global and the PRC markets. Should there be any significant increases in the price of raw paper, and if we are unable to pass on such increases in costs to our customers or find alternative suppliers who are able to supply us raw paper at reasonable prices, our business and profitability would be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by a significant or prolonged economic downturn in the level of consumer spending in the industries and markets served by our customers.\nOur business is affected by the number of orders that we are able to secure from our customers, which is determined by the level of business activity of our customers. The level of business activity of our customers is in turn determined by the level of consumer spending in the markets our customers serve.\nWe sell most of our products to consumer goods manufacturers in the YRD. Certain of these customers produce consumer goods for overseas markets, in addition to the PRC market. Any significant or prolonged decline of the PRC economy or economy of such other markets will affect consumers' disposable income and consumer spending in these markets, and lead to a decrease in demand for consumer products. To the extent that such decrease in demand for consumer products translates into a decline in the demand for paper packaging products such as our paper cartons, our performance will be adversely affected.\nA large percentage of our sales revenue is derived from sales to a limited number of customers, and our business will suffer if sales to these customers decline.\nSales to our five major customers, Hangzhou Panasonic Home Electrical Appliance Co., Ltd., Suzhou Samsung Electrical Co., Ltd., Nongfu Spring Co., Ltd., China Resources Snow Breweries Co., Ltd., and Hangzhou Cigarette Company accounted in aggregate for approximately 23.2% of our revenue for 2014.\nOur ability to retain these major customers is important to our continued success. There is, however, no assurance that these customers will continue to purchase our products at the current levels in the future. There is also no assurance that we will be able to decrease our dependence on these major customers over time. In the event that these major customers cease or reduce significantly their purchase of our products and we are unable to obtain substitute orders of comparable size, there will be a material adverse impact on our financial performance and position.\nOur customers are principally located within a 500 kilometer radius from our manufacturing plant. Due to the cost of transportation and the need for timely delivery, serving customers situated outside that radius is less attractive economically for us. If we lose our major customers, we may not be able to replace these accounts with customers within the 500 kilometer radius. If we have to service accounts outside that radius, our cost may increase, thereby affecting our margins adversely.\nThe continuing consolidation of our customer base may intensify pricing pressures and may negatively affect our financial performance.\nOver the last few years, many of our large customers have acquired, or been acquired by, companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the concentration of our largest customers, and resulted in increased pricing pressures from our customers. The continuing consolidation of our customer base may negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe may be unable to execute our growth plans or effectively manage our expansion.\nWe plan to grow externally by acquiring complementary businesses. We also plan to grow organically by increasing purchase commitments from existing clients and further penetrating existing markets. These expansion plans may strain our financial resources. They may also overstretch our management personnel and require us to restructure our management structure. We may be unsuccessful in the timely or cost-efficient expansion of our production capacity to meet anticipated increases in the demand for our products. Expansion projects may not be constructed within the anticipated timetable or within budget. Any material delay in completing such projects, or any substantial increase in costs or quality issues in connection with them, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, or result in a loss of business opportunities.\nTo accommodate our growth pursuant to our strategies, we will need to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce, and effectively manage our relationships with our customers and suppliers. We will also need to expand capital resources and dedicate personnel to implement and upgrade our accounting, operational and internal management systems and to enhance our record keeping and contract tracking system. All of these endeavors will require substantial management effort and skills and the incurrence of additional expenditures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to efficiently or effectively implement our growth strategies and manage the growth of our operations, and any failure to do so may limit our future growth and hamper our business strategy.\nWe may require additional funding for our growth plans, and such funding may result in a dilution of your investment, limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise restrict our business operations.\nWe attempted to estimate our funding requirements in order to implement our growth plans. Our growth plans include growth through acquisitions. Although the proceeds from our public offering closed in December 2010 should be sufficient for us to implement our near term acquisition strategy, we may require additional capital in order to successfully operate businesses that we acquire.\nIf the costs of implementing our growth plans, including the cost of operating businesses that we acquire, should exceed these estimates significantly, or if we come across opportunities to grow through expansion plans which cannot be predicted at this time, and funds generated from our operations prove insufficient for such purposes, we may need to raise additional funds.\nWe may raise additional funds by issuing equity, equity-linked securities or debt securities or by borrowing from banks or other resources. We cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we will not be able to implement such plans fully. Even if we succeed in obtaining financing, such financing may be accompanied by conditions that limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek lenders\u2019 consent for payment of dividends, or restrict our freedom to operate.\nAdditional funding from debt financings may make it more difficult for us to operate our business because we would need to make principal and interest payments on the indebtedness and may be obligated to abide by restrictive covenants contained in the debt financing agreements. Further, if we raise additional funds by issuing new shares, any stockholders unable or unwilling to participate in such fund raising may suffer dilution in their investment.\nCovenants in certain loan agreements entered into by us restrict our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions, which may cause disruption to our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nWe have entered into loan agreements with banks in the PRC which contain various covenants that may limit our discretion in operating the business of our subsidiaries.\nOur lenders have rights that include those that:\nrestrict us from undertaking any shareholding change or restructuring without obtaining prior approval of the lender;\nrestrict us from undertaking mergers and acquisitions or any other joint venture arrangement without prior approval of the lender;\nrestrict us from undertaking withdraw of capital, asset transfer, or equity transfer;\nrestrict us from undertaking major investment, asset transfer, leasing, pledging or mortgaging its assets without obtaining prior approval of the lender; and\nrestrict the distribution of dividends if after tax profit for a particular fiscal year (1) equals nil or less; (2) is insufficient to offset a deficit of prior years; or (3) is insufficient to pay off principal and interest due during the fiscal year.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the lenders' approval for these transactions. These restrictions on our business may cause disruption in our business operations. Our lenders may restrict us from disposing of or restructuring the ownership of our operating facilities and limit our ability to undertake any acquisition or major investment. Even if we fail to obtain their approval for any such transaction, we must give timely notice of the transaction. In the event of such technical breach, the lender may have the right to rescind the loan, which would materially and adversely affect our operations, future prospects and results of operations.\nOur acquisition and investment in other businesses may be unsuccessful.\nWe intend to selectively pursue strategic acquisition and investment opportunities which complement or enhance our current businesses with new product lines or expand our customer base at the appropriate time. However, we may encounter strong competition during the acquisition or investment process and we may fail to select or value targets appropriately, which may result in our experiencing difficulty in completing such acquisitions or investments at reasonable cost, or at all. Even if an acquisition or investment is successful, we may have to allocate additional capital and human resources to implement the integration of the new line of business. There is no assurance that we can successfully obtain or renew licenses or national or local government approvals for operating new lines of business or successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or do so within a reasonable period of time or that the acquired businesses will generate the expected economic benefits.\nOne of our growth strategies is to expand our customer base by entering markets in regions outside the YRD. We may face various challenges when entering into markets in other regions. For example, we will have to understand and adjust to local business practices; the transportation infrastructure in other regions may not be as developed as the YRD, which may result in higher costs; and we may encounter difficulty in obtaining or renewing licenses and government approvals.\nFurthermore, our experience in serving customers in the YRD may not be applicable in other parts of China. We cannot assure you that we will be able to leverage our experience in the YRD to expand into other parts of China. In our entry into new markets, we may face competition from paper packaging companies with established experience or presence in the geographical areas in which we plan to expand and from other paper packaging companies with similar expansion targets, in addition to the uncertainties discussed in the three preceding risk factors. There is no assurance that we will have similar success in regions outside the YRD. Our failure to manage any of our planned expansion or acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur certificates, permits, and licenses related to our operations are subject to governmental control and renewal, and failure to obtain or renew such certificates, permits, and licenses will cause all or part of our operations to be terminated.\nOur operations require licenses, permits and, in some cases, renewals of these licenses and permits from various governmental authorities in the PRC. Our ability to obtain, maintain, or renew such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to change, as, among other things, the regulations and policies of applicable governmental authorities may change.\nGreat Shengda, Shengda Color and Hangzhou Shengming hold printing licenses for decorative printing on packages, valid until December 31, 2017. These printing licenses are renewable at the end of their terms by application to the relevant authorities. The printing license of Suzhou AA was valid until March 1, 2014, and is in the process of renewing the license with local authorities as of the reporting date of this Form 10-K. Each of Great Shengda, Shengda Color, and Hangzhou Shengming holds a pollutant discharge permit issued by the local environmental protection bureau. If our printing licenses are revoked or suspended or we are unable to renew a printing license for any reason, we cannot assure you that our business operations will not be stopped and, correspondingly, our financial performance would be adversely affected.\nShuangsheng, Suzhou AA, Shengda Concept, and Shengda Zhongtian are in the process of obtaining various approvals, permits and licenses, including, but not limited to, certain environmental approvals and a pollutant discharge permit. We cannot assure you that we will be successful and timely in obtaining such approvals, licenses and permits. Failure to do so may subject us to monetary fines or other penalties, including possible suspension of Shuangsheng, Suzhou AA, Shengda Concept, and Shengda Zhongtian\u2019s operations.\nWe depend heavily on qualified personnel, and loss of these personnel could harm our business.\nOur future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our senior management and key technical personnel, including our Chairman, Nengbin Fang, and our Chief Executive Officer, Daliang Teng, both of whom have a long history with the Company. Turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team and impair our operations. If we lose a key employee, or if a key employee fails to perform in his or her current position, our business could suffer. We must attract, recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees. We face competition for qualified personnel from other companies in our industry and from other organizations. Competition for these individuals could cause us to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain these qualified employees, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the process of hiring qualified personnel is often lengthy. If our recruitment and retention efforts are unsuccessful in the future, it may be more difficult for us to execute our business strategies.\nIn addition, if any of these qualified personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some of our customers. We have entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with all of our key personnel. However, if any disputes arise between these key personnel and us, it is not clear, in light of uncertainties associated with the PRC legal system, what the court decision will be and the extent to which the court decision could be enforced in China, where all of these key personnel reside and hold most of their assets. See \u201c-Risks Related to Doing Business in China-Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.\u201d\nAny future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We may incur substantial sums pursuant to our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers.\nFrom time to time we may be subject to litigation, including potential stockholder derivative actions. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. Our bylaws require us to indemnify our current and past directors and officers from reasonable expenses related to the defense of any action arising from their service to our Company, which may be substantial. Such expenditure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and liquidity. The lack of D&O insurance may make it difficult for us to retain and attract talented and skilled directors and officers to serve our Company, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unable to adequately safeguard our intellectual property or we may face claims that may be costly to resolve or that limit our ability to use such intellectual property in the future.\nOur business is materially dependent on our intellectual property. Our technical know-how is the result of our research and development efforts, which we believe to be proprietary and unique. We have obtained 19 patents for utility models. We cannot, however, assure you that we will be able to prevent third parties from infringing our intellectual property rights and utilize our patented technology. Further, third parties may assert infringement claims against us with respect to our intellectual property or attempt to invalidate our patents; we cannot assure you that such claims will not be successful. Even if we succeed in establishing or protecting our intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial costs and divert significant management resources in enforcing our right or defending any claims. If any party succeeds in asserting a claim against us relating to a disputed intellectual property, we may need to obtain licenses to continue to use the relevant design or technology. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could cause our business results to suffer. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, non-disclosure and other contractual agreements with our employees, as well as limitation of access to and distribution of our intellectual property, in our efforts to protect intellectual property. However, our efforts in this regard may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or we may be unable to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be successful. If litigation is necessary to safeguard our intellectual property rights, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, we could incur substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or future prospects.\nInfringement of our Shengda trademark may hurt our business.\nOur Shengda trademark is protected through trademark registration in the PRC. Although we do not use the trademark on the cartons we produce, which usually have the trademarks or brand-names of our customers, we have built a significant amount of goodwill around our Shengda trademark among our customers and in the industry. If third parties infringe upon our Shengda trademark by unlawfully passing off their products as our products or imitating or using our Shengda trademark, we may face considerable difficulties and costly litigation in order to fully protect our rights in the trademark. An even more serious consequence may be damage to our reputation as a manufacturer of quality products. Our brand, reputation and sales volume may be materially and adversely affected by an infringement of our trademark.\nOur facilities and inventory may be affected by fire or natural calamities. Our operations are also subject to the risk of power outage, equipment failure or labor disturbances and other business interruptions. We have limited insurance coverage and do not carry any business interruption insurance.\nA fire, flood or other natural calamity may result in significant damage to our production facilities and inventory. Our operations are subject to risks of various business interruptions, including power outage, equipment failure or disturbances that may result from labor unrest. If we are unable to obtain timely replacements of damaged inventory or equipment, or if we are unable to find an acceptable contract manufacturer in the event our production facilities are damaged by a catastrophic event, then major disruptions to our production could have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial results. For example, it would take us about four months to replace our German BHS2800 paperboard production line if that line were significantly damaged. During that time, our production would be significantly hampered and our revenues would diminish significantly. Also, our property insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages to our production facilities, and we do not carry any business interruption insurance covering lost profits as a result of the disruption to our production.\nWe have limited insurance coverage and do not carry any third-party liability insurance or insurance that covers the risk of loss of our products in shipment.\nIf any of our products are defective, then we may be subject to product liability claims or we may have to engage in a product recall. Our employees or independent third parties may suffer injury from accidents at our facilities. We do not carry any product liability insurance with respect to our products or third-party liability insurance to cover claims pertaining to personal injury or property or environmental damages arising from defects in our products, product recalls or accidents on our property. We only have limited insurance coverage for property and machinery damage. Our existing insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all the risks associated with our business. As a result, we may be required to pay for losses, damages and liabilities, including those caused by natural disasters and other events beyond our control, out of our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, under the shipping terms of some of our customer contracts, we bear the risk of loss in the shipment of our products. We do not insure this risk. While we believe that the transportation companies that we use carry adequate insurance or are sufficiently solvent to cover any loss in shipment, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately reimbursed upon the loss of a significant amount of our products.\nAside from impairing our financial performance, any slowdown or interruption in our production processes could negatively affect our brand.\nWe manufacture or assemble our products at our facilities in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. Our manufacturing operations are complicated and integrated; involving the coordination of raw materials sourced from third parties, internal production processes and external distribution processes. While these operations are modified on a regular basis to improve manufacturing and distribution efficiency and flexibility, we may experience difficulties in coordinating the various aspects of our manufacturing processes, thereby causing downtime and delays. We have also been steadily increasing our production capacity. However, we may not be able to obtain enough resources in time to operate our facilities at the same or higher capacity and to increase our production volume. Any interruptions in our production could result in our inability to produce our products, which would reduce our sales revenue and earnings for the affected period. If there is a stoppage in production at any of our facilities, even if only temporary, or delays in delivery times to our customers, our business and reputation could be severely affected. Any significant delays in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations and cause us to lose future sales. We currently do not have business interruption insurance to offset these potential losses, delays and risks so a material interruption of our business operations could severely damage our business.\nInability to maintain our competitiveness would adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a competitive environment and face competition from existing competitors and new market entrants. Companies in our industry compete with each other on quality of products, production capacity, pricing, brand name, timely delivery and customer service. Some of our competitors are large, vertically integrated companies that have greater financial and other resources and greater manufacturing economics of scale, compared to our company.\nCompetition in the products we manufacture could increase if our competitors begin to price their products more attractively in order to gain market share, or develop or acquire technology to reduce their cost of production.\nFurthermore, our industry is currently very fragmented, with a large number of small manufacturers serving local customers. Although this provides opportunities for us to grow externally, other competitors may have the same growth strategy and may be able to execute their growth strategy more speedily than we can, thereby gaining market share at our expense.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. Any failure by us to remain competitive would adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are exposed to credit risks of our customers.\nWe typically grant our customers credit periods ranging from 60 to 120 days. For 2014 and 2013, our accounts receivable turnover days were 99 days and 103 days, respectively. If any future event derails the economic growth in China or undermines the confidence in or puts further strains on the world financial system, we may have to extend longer credit periods or our customers may become less creditworthy, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nCertain of our existing stockholders have substantial influence over our company, and their interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other stockholders.\nWuxiao Fang, his son, Nengbin Fang, and his daughter, Congyi Fang, together currently own approximately 54.02% of our common stock. As a result, they have significant influence over our business, including decisions regarding mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions, while their interest may not always align with the interest of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a future change of control, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our shares.\nEnvironmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to PRC laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to increase expenditures to comply with any new environmental regulations applicable to our operations.\nIf we are found liable for violation of environmental regulations, our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected and our permits and licenses may be suspended or revoked by Chinese regulatory authorities.\nOur operations are subject to various risks associated with our use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, some of which are corrosive and flammable. If we are found liable for contamination, injury to employees or others, or other harm related to our use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe use, handle, store and dispose of hazardous materials in our operations; therefore, we are required to maintain necessary filings with the local competent authority and we have made such filings with the local safety supervision authority as required by law. However, any future failure to maintain or update effective filings with the local safety supervision authority may subject us to monetary fines or suspension or revocation of licenses or permits. In addition, in operating our business we use and store certain materials that may be regarded as occupational hazards. Therefore, we are also required to maintain necessary filings with the local hygiene authority for use and storage of those occupational hazardous materials. We have made filings with the local hygiene authority for use of xylene in our production. However, any failure to maintain or update effective filings with the local hygiene authority may subject us to monetary fines or orders to cease operation at our manufacturing facilities.\nWe cannot completely eliminate the risks of contamination, injury to employees or others, or other harms related to our use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Although we have not experienced incidents in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not experience fires, leakages and other accidents. In the event of future incidents, we could be liable for any damages that may result, including potentially significant monetary damages for any civil litigation or government proceedings related to a personal injury claim, as well as fines, penalties and other consequences, including suspension or revocation of our licenses or permits, suspension of production, and cessation of operations at our manufacturing facilities, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we currently do not carry any insurance coverage for potential liabilities relating to the release of hazardous materials.\nWe may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to have the operating effectiveness of our internal controls attested to by our independent auditors.\nCompanies that file reports with the SEC, including us, are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX 404. SOX 404 requires management to establish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting and annual reports on Form 10-K filed under the Exchange Act to contain a report from management assessing the effectiveness of a company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Separately, under SOX 404, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, public companies that are large accelerated or accelerated filers must include in their annual reports on Form 10-K an attestation report of their regular auditors attesting to and reporting on management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Non-accelerated filers and smaller reporting companies are not required to include an attestation report of their auditors in annual reports.\nA report of our management is included under Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this report. We are a smaller reporting company and, consequently, are not required to include an attestation report of our auditor in this annual report. Although our management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014, we can provide no assurance that we will comply with all of the requirements imposed thereby and we will receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors in the future, when required. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nOur holding company structure may limit the payment of dividends.\nWe have no direct business operations, other than our ownership of our subsidiaries. While we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in debt financing agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars.\nChinese regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their after tax profits according to Chinese accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserve funds. Currently, our subsidiaries in China are the only sources of revenues or investment holdings for the payment of dividends. If they do not accumulate sufficient profits under Chinese accounting standards and regulations to first fund certain reserve funds as required by Chinese accounting standards, we will be unable to pay any dividends.\nRISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA\nAdverse changes in political, economic and other policies of the Chinese government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could materially and adversely affect the growth of our business and our competitive position.\nOur business operations are conducted in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:\nthe degree of government involvement;\nthe level of development;\nthe growth rate;\nthe control of foreign exchange;\nthe allocation of resources;\nan evolving regulatory system; and\na lack of sufficient transparency in the regulatory process.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past 30 years, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese economy has also experienced certain adverse effects due to the recent global financial crisis. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us.\nThe Chinese economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although in recent years the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of the productive assets in China is still owned by the Chinese government. The continued control of these assets and other aspects of the national economy by the Chinese government could materially and adversely affect our business. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over Chinese economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nAny adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on overall economic growth, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.\nWe conduct all of our business through our subsidiaries in the PRC. Our subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to FIEs. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations, and rules are not always uniform, and enforcement of these laws, regulations, and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, most of our executive officers and directors are residents of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to affect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese operations and subsidiaries.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nMost of our assets are located outside of the United States and most of our current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, most of whom are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Our counsel as to PRC law has advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Courts in China may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security, or the public interest. So it is uncertain whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.\nThe PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.\nThe PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.\nAccordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.\nOur legal right to certain leased properties could be challenged by governmental authorities or third parties due to our lessors' lack of proper land use rights or building ownership over such properties and mortgages on those properties.\nWe lease most land and buildings from related parties and third parties. Our lessors are required to comply with various land- and property-related laws and regulations to enable them to lease their properties for industrial use. For example, properties used for productive entities and the underlying land should be approved for industrial use purposes by competent governmental authorities and should have appropriate building ownership certificates. In addition, before any properties located on land owned by collective organizations may be leased to third parties, lessors are required to obtain appropriate approvals from the competent governmental authorities. We lease a parcel of land of approximately 3,328 square meters from Heshang Town Xiangheqiao Village Economic Cooperative, but we were not provided with the land use right certificate in respect of the leased land or any other evidence issued by the proper and competent authority showing that Heshang Town Xiangheqiao Village Economic Cooperative has obtained appropriate approvals to lease the land use rights to us. This failure may subject the lessor or us to monetary fines or other penalties and may lead to the invalidation or termination of our lease by the competent governmental authorities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to operate our manufacturing business. While Heshang Town Xiangheqiao Village Economic Cooperative has agreed to indemnify us against any loss incurred by us related to the title or nature of the use of this land, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully enforce the indemnity of the lessor. As a result, we may suffer losses resulting from the lessor's failure to obtain the required approvals to the extent that we could not be fully indemnified by the lessor.\nWe lease buildings with a total area of approximately 23,568 square meters from SD Group, which does not hold any building ownership certificates related to these buildings. We were informed that SD Group is applying for building ownership certificates for those buildings. We also lease the buildings with total area of approximately 63,536 square meters from Hangzhou Xin Shengda Investment Co. Ltd., or Xin Shengda. Xin Shengda only has building ownership certificates covering approximately 53,180 square meters of the leased buildings. Xin Shengda has advised us that it is applying for building ownership certificates for the remaining areas. However, there can be no assurance that these two lessors will successfully obtain the requisite building ownership certificates. As a result, we cannot assure you that our rights under those leases will not be challenged by competent governmental authorities. Any challenge to our legal rights to the properties under the leases used for our manufacturing operations, if successful, could impair or adversely affect our business and operations on those properties.\nThe buildings we lease from Xin Shengda are also subject to a mortgage. Xin Shengda did not obtain the required consent to the lease from the mortgagee. As a result, the lease may not be binding on the mortgagee or a transferee who acquires the property upon any foreclosure under the mortgage. While Xin Shengda, as the lessor, has agreed to indemnify us for any loss incurred as a result of the mortgagee's foreclosure on the mortgage, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully enforce the lessor's indemnity to the full extent. As a result, we may suffer losses to the extent we are not fully indemnified by the lessor.\nUnder PRC laws, all lease agreements are required to be registered with the local housing bureau, while as set forth above, not all our lease have been registered. This may expose both our lessors and our subsidiaries to potential monetary fines. Some of our rights under the unregistered leases may also be subordinated to the rights of third parties.\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business in China.\nIn recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past ten years, the rate of inflation in China has been as high as 6.5% and as low as -0.8% . These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products and our company.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales effectively.\nThe majority of our sales will be settled in RMB, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that FIEs may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of RMB for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval in China, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. The Chinese regulatory authorities may impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB.\nIn addition, the Notice of the General Affairs Department of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on the Relevant Operating Issues concerning the Improvement of the Administration of Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, issued by SAFE and effective as of August 29, 2008, or Circular 142, regulates the conversion by FIEs of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. Circular 142 requires that RMB converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the relevant government authority and may not be used to make equity investments in PRC, unless specifically provided otherwise. SAFE further strengthened its oversight over the flow and use of RMB funds converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE. The use of such RMB may not be changed without approval from SAFE, and may not be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used. Any violation of Circular 142 may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nThe value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars, as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.\nSince July 2005, the RMB has no longer been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People\u2019s Bank of China, or PBOC, regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.\nRestrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, pay dividends to you, and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nAll of our sales are earned by our PRC subsidiaries. However, as discussed more fully under Item 1 \u201cBusiness -Regulation-Dividend Distributions,\u201d PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent company. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nFailure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries' ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us.\nOn July 4, 2014, SAFE issued the Notice on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Residents\u2019 Investment and Financing and Round-Trip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37. Circular 37 repeals and Circular 75. Circular 37 regulates the foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of a SPV by PRC residents to seek offshore equity financing and conduct \u201cround trip investment\u201d in China. See Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Regulation-Circular 37\u201d for a detailed discussion of Circular 37 and its implementation.\nWe have asked our stockholders, who are PRC residents as defined in Circular 75, to register with the relevant branch of SAFE as then required in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions of equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries. Circular 37 shall apply to any subsequent amendments made by our stockholders after the effective date of Circurlar 37.However, we cannot provide any assurances that they can obtain the above SAFE registrations required by Circular 37. Moreover, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 37 by our PRC resident beneficial holders.\nIn addition, such PRC residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 37. We also have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect stockholders or the outcome of such registration procedures. A failure by our PRC resident beneficial holders or future PRC resident stockholders to comply with Circular 37, if SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies promulgated the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rule, which became effective on September 8, 2006 and was amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rule governs the approval process by which a Chinese company may participate in an acquisition of assets or equity interests. Depending on the structure of the transaction, the M&A Rule will require the parties to the transaction to make a series of applications to certain government agencies. In some instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction. Government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies. Compliance with the M&A Rule is likely to be more time consuming and expensive than in the past, and the government can now exert more control over the combination of two businesses. Accordingly, due to the M&A Rule, our ability to engage in business combination transactions has become significantly more complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to our stockholders or sufficiently protect their interests in a transaction. The M&A Rule allows Chinese government agencies to assess the economic terms of a business combination transaction. Parties to a business combination transaction may have to submit to MOFCOM and other relevant government agencies an appraisal report and the acquisition agreement, all of which form part of the application for approval, depending on the structure of the transaction. The M&A Rule also prohibits a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the Chinese business or assets and, in certain transaction structures, requires that consideration must be paid within defined periods, generally not in excess of a year. The M&A Rule also limits our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of the initial consideration, contingent consideration, holdback provisions, indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction structures involving trusts, nominees and similar entities are prohibited. Therefore, the M&A Rule may impede our implementation of our growth strategy.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.\nOn March 16, 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress of China passed the EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed its implementing rules, which took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within China is considered a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. See Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Regulation-Taxation\u201d for a detailed discussion of the EIT Law.\nIt remains unclear whether the PRC tax authorities would require or permit our overseas registered entities to be treated as PRC resident enterprises. We do not currently consider our company to be a PRC resident enterprise. However, if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on offering proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries may qualify as \u201ctax-exempt income,\u201d we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC stockholders from transferring our stock.\nWe face uncertainty from China\u2019s Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on NonResident Enterprises' Share Transfer that was released in December 2009 with retroactive effect from January 1, 2008.\nThe Chinese State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, released a circular on December 15, 2009 that addresses the transfer of shares by nonresident companies, generally referred to as Circular 698. Circular 698, which was effective retroactively to January 1, 2008, may have a significant impact on many companies that use offshore holding companies to invest in China. Circular 698, which provides parties with a short period of time to comply with its requirements, indirectly taxes foreign companies on gains derived from the indirect sale of a Chinese company. Where a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity interests in a Chinese resident enterprise by selling the shares in an offshore holding company, and the latter is located in a country or jurisdiction where the effective tax burden is less than 12.5% or where the offshore income of his, her, or its residents is not taxable, the foreign investor is required to provide the tax authority in charge of that Chinese resident enterprise with the relevant information within 30 days of the transfers. Moreover, where a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity interests in a Chinese resident enterprise through an abuse of form of organization and there are no reasonable commercial purposes such that the corporate income tax liability is avoided, the PRC tax authority will have the power to re-assess the nature of the equity transfer in accordance with PRC\u2019s \u201csubstance-over-form\u201d principle and deny the existence of the offshore holding company that is used for tax planning purposes. There is uncertainty as to the application of Circular 698. For example, while the term \"indirectly transfer\" is not defined, it is understood that the relevant PRC tax authorities have jurisdiction regarding requests for information over a wide range of foreign entities having no direct contact with China. Moreover, the relevant authority has not yet promulgated any formal provisions or formally declared or stated how to calculate the effective tax in the country or jurisdiction and to what extent and the process of the disclosure to the tax authority in charge of that Chinese resident enterprise. In addition, there are not any formal declarations with regard to how to decide \u201cabuse of form of organization\u201d and \u201creasonable commercial purpose,\u201d which can be utilized by us to balance if our Company complies with the Circular 698. As a result, we may become at risk of being taxed under Circular 698 and we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 or to establish that we should not be taxed under Circular 698, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe new provisions of the PRC Employment Contract Law may substantially increase our labor-related costs in the future.\nThe PRC Employment Contract Law, which became effective as of January 1, 2008, contains many more provisions favorable to employees than prior labor regulations in effect in China. This may substantially increase our labor-related costs in our future operations. According to the new law, an employee is entitled to terminate his or her employment relationship with his or her employer for certain causes, such as delay in payment of wages or social insurance contribution or dissatisfactory labor protection, and under such circumstances the employer is liable to pay compensation to the employee. The amount of such compensation payment shall be one month's salary for each year that the employee has served the employer. If the monthly wage of an employee is three times greater than the average monthly wage in the previous year for employees as announced by the people's government at the municipal level directly under the central government or at the city with district level authority where the employer is located, the rate for the financial compensation paid to him shall be three times the average monthly wage of employees and shall be for not more than 12 years of work. In contrast to at-will employment arrangements, most employment arrangements in China are for a fixed term. An employer may also be liable to compensate an employee when the employer decides to terminate an existing employment before its expiration. In addition, if the labor market tightens in China or in the YRD, our labor costs may experience further increase.\nOur failure to fully comply with PRC labor laws exposes us to potential liability.\nCompanies operating in China must comply with a variety of labor laws, including social insurance, housing fund and other employee welfare payment obligations. Uncertainties exist as to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of these obligations. We believe we have paid all necessary social insurance contributions for all the employees of Great Shengda, Shengda Color and Hangzhou Shengming in accordance with applicable law. Further, we intend to pay all relevant social insurance contributions for all the employees of Suzhou AA, which recently obtained its social insurance registration certificate, in accordance with applicable law. However, if relevant governmental authorities determine that we have not complied fully with these obligations, we may be in violation of applicable PRC labor laws and we cannot assure you that PRC governmental authorities will not impose penalties on us for our failure to comply with these regulations. In addition, if any current or former employee files a complaint with the relevant governmental authorities, we may be subject to fulfilling employee welfare obligations as well as paying administrative fines.\nCurrently, we do not pay housing fund for our employees as required under the PRC law. The local Xiaoshan housing fund authority issued a certification to us on July 6, 2010, which certifies that the housing fund system is not fully implemented in Xiaoshan district, that the local Xiaoshan housing fund authority will extend the housing fund system to us in the near future and that the local Xiaoshan housing fund authority will not require us to fulfill our past housing fund contribution obligations retroactively. However, there can be no assurance that we will not be challenged by our employees for failure to pay housing fund as required by law and that we will not be punished by the local housing fund authority in the future.\nWe must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time to time in China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from some companies and gain an advantage in securing business, or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, thus putting us at a disadvantage. Our employees, agents, representatives and consultants may not always be subject to our control. If any of them violates the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, we might be held responsible, and we could be subject to severe penalties as a result. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability for FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or which we acquire.\nIf we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nRecently, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, particularly companies like us which have completed so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits, SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our Company, our business and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our company. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our company and business operations will be severely and your investment in our stock could be rendered worthless.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located in China where substantially all of our operations and business are located have conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosure.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located primarily in the United States, however, substantially all of our operations are located in China. Since substantially all of our operations and business takes place in China, it may be more difficult for the Staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing our disclosure. These same obstacles are not present for similar companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily in the United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosure and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our company and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements has been reviewed or otherwise been scrutinized by any local regulator.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MARKET FOR OUR STOCK GENERALLY\nOur common stock is subject to price volatility related and unrelated to our operations.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.\nOur common stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.\nThe listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market provide that a company, in order to qualify for continued listing, must maintain a minimum stock price, satisfy standards relative to minimum stockholders' equity, minimum market value of publicly held shares and various additional requirements. If we fail to comply with all listing standards applicable to issuers listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, it could reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. In addition, the delisting of our common stock could materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and any limitation on liquidity or reduction in the price of our common stock could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital. Delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market could also result in other negative consequences, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nWe may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called \"penny stocks\" to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our common stock were delisted and became a \"penny stock,\" we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the Penny Stock Rule. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nThere can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nProvisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws or Nevada law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of the common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our Board without further action by the stockholders. These terms may include voting rights including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of such common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change-in-control, which in turn could prevent our stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, Nevada corporate law and our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain other provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in its management that our stockholders may deem advantageous. These provisions:\ndeny holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, meaning that stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock will be able to elect all of our directors;\nrequire any stockholder wishing to properly bring a matter before a meeting of stockholders to comply with specified procedural and advance notice requirements; and\nallow any vacancy on the Board, however the vacancy occurs, to be filled by the directors.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business in the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 12484, "SIC": 2650, "TIC": "CPGI"}
