{"cik": "1297341", "company": "Kentucky First Federal Bancorp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRising interest rates may hurt our profits and asset values.\nIn response to the Covid-19 virus pandemic, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) decreased interest rates to near zero in March 2020. The low interest rate environment remained in effect at June 30, 2020, and the FOMC announced at its September 2020 meeting that it expects interest rates to remain low through 2023.\nIf interest rates rise, our net interest income may decline in the short term since, due to the generally shorter terms of interest-bearing liabilities, interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, increases more quickly than interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments. In addition, rising interest rates may hurt our income because of reduced demand for new loans, the demand for refinancing loans and the interest and fee income earned on new loans and refinancings. While we believe that modest interest rate increases will not significantly hurt our interest rate spread over the long term due to our high level of liquidity and the presence of a significant amount of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in our loan portfolio, interest rate increases may initially reduce our interest rate spread until such time as our loans and investments reprice to higher levels.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets, and in particular our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as separate components of equity. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for residential real estate. Included in this legislation were: (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes.\nThe recent changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA larger percentage of our loans are collateralized by real estate and disruptions in the real estate market may result in losses and hurt our earnings.\nApproximately 95.9% of our loan portfolio at June 30, 2020 was comprised of loans collateralized by real estate. Disruptions in the real estate market could significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If real estate values decline, it will become more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses. If during a period of reduced real estate values, we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase our allowance for loan losses, it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition.\nStrong competition within our market areas could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nAlthough we consider ourselves competitive in our market areas, we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in our earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which reduces net interest income. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability will depend upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market areas.\nThe distressed economy in First Federal of Hazard\u2019s market area could hurt our profits and slow our growth.\nFirst Federal of Hazard\u2019s market area consists of Perry and surrounding counties in eastern Kentucky. The economy in this market area has been distressed in recent years due to the decline in the coal industry on which the economy has been dependent. While the region has seen improvement in the economy from the influx of other industries, such as health care and manufacturing, the competition provided by new methods of extracting natural gas has recently hurt the coal industry. As a consequence, the economy in First Federal of Hazard\u2019s market area continues to lag behind the economies of Kentucky and the United States and First Federal of Hazard has experienced insufficient loan demand in its market area. Moreover, the slow economy in First Federal of Hazard\u2019s market area will limit our ability to grow our asset base in that market.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and examination. Such regulation, supervision and examination governs the activities in which we may engage, and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and our depositors.\nIn 2010 and 2011, in response to the financial crisis and recession that began in 2008, significant regulatory and legislative changes resulted in broad reform and increased regulation affecting financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act has created a significant shift in the way financial institutions operate and has restructured the regulation of depository institutions by merging the Office of Thrift Supervision, which previously regulated the Banks, into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and assigning the regulation of savings and loan holding companies, including the Company and the MHC, to the Federal Reserve Board. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws, a function that was formerly performed by the depository institution regulators. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking regulators have proposed new consolidated capital requirements that will limit our ability to borrow at the holding company level and invest the proceeds from such borrowings as capital in the Banks that could be leveraged to support additional growth. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various other provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as that which occurred in 2008 and 2009. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations may not be known for years until final regulations implementing the legislation are adopted. The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs. Any future legislative changes could have a material impact on our profitability, the value of assets held for investment or the value of collateral for loans. Future legislative changes could also require changes to business practices and potentially expose us to additional costs, liabilities, enforcement action and reputational risk.\nIn addition to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal regulatory agencies recently have begun to take stronger supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan losses and other weaknesses as a result of the recent economic crisis. These actions include the entering into of written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on their operations. Federal banking regulators recently have also been using with more frequency their ability to impose individual minimal capital requirements on banks, which requirements may be higher than those imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act or which would otherwise qualify the bank as being \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\u2019s prompt corrective action regulations. If we were to become subject to a supervisory agreement or higher individual capital requirements, such action may have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business plans, as well as our ability to grow, pay dividends, repurchase stock or engage in mergers and acquisitions and may result in restrictions in our operations. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Regulation of Federal Savings Institutions-Capital Requirements\u201d for a discussion of regulatory capital requirements.\nWe expect that our return on equity will be low compared to other companies as a result of our high level of capital.\nReturn on average equity, which equals net income divided by average equity, is a ratio used by many investors to compare the performance of a particular company with other companies. For the year ended June 30, 2020, our return on average equity was -19.0%. We may manage excess capital through a stock repurchase program when cash availability and market prices make such purchases appropriate. Our goal of generating a return on average equity that is competitive with other publicly-held subsidiaries of mutual holding companies, by increasing earnings per share and book value per share, without assuming undue risk, could take a number of years to achieve, and we cannot assure that our goal will be attained. Consequently, you should not expect a competitive return on average equity in the near future. Failure to achieve a competitive return on average equity might make an investment in our common stock unattractive to some investors and might cause our common stock to trade at lower prices than comparable companies with higher returns on average equity.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nIn July 2013, the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that will substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to First Federal of Hazard, First Federal of Kentucky and Kentucky First. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for First Federal of Hazard, First Federal of Kentucky and Kentucky First on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation\u201d buffer of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions. As of June 30, 2020, the capital levels of First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky exceed the required capital amounts according to the Community Bank Leverage Ratio regulations and we believe they also meet the fully-phased in minimum capital requirements. See Note K-Stockholders\u2019 Equity and Regulatory Capital of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for us could among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were unable to comply with such requirements. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Regulation of Federal Savings Institutions-Capital Requirements.\u201d\nAdditional annual employee compensation and benefit expenses may reduce our profitability and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe will continue to recognize employee compensation and benefit expenses for employees and executives under our benefit plans. With regard to the employee stock ownership plan, applicable accounting practices require that the expense be based on the fair market value of the shares of common stock at specific points in the future, therefore we will recognize expenses for our employee stock ownership plan when shares are committed to be released to participants\u2019 accounts. In addition, employees of both subsidiary Banks participate in a defined-benefit plan through Pentegra. Costs associated with the defined-benefit plans could increase or legislation could be enacted that would increase the Banks\u2019 obligations under the plan or change the methods the Banks use in accounting for the plans. Those changes could adversely affect personnel expense and the Company\u2019s balance sheet. The Company froze the defined benefit plan in April 2019 after which time active employees will no longer accrue additional benefits in the plan and no new employees will be enrolled in the plan.\nFirst Federal MHC owns a majority of our common stock and is able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders, including preventing sale or merger transactions you may like or a second-step conversion by First Federal MHC.\nFirst Federal MHC owns a majority of our common stock and, through its Board of Directors, is able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders. As a federally chartered mutual holding company, the board of directors of First Federal MHC must ensure that the interests of depositors of First Federal of Hazard are represented and considered in matters put to a vote of stockholders of Kentucky First. Therefore, the votes cast by First Federal MHC may not be in your personal best interests as a stockholder. For example, First Federal MHC may exercise its voting control to prevent a sale or merger transaction in which stockholders could receive a premium for their shares, prevent a second-step conversion transaction by First Federal MHC or defeat a stockholder nominee for election to the Board of Directors of Kentucky First. However, implementation of a stock-based incentive plan will require approval of Kentucky First\u2019s stockholders other than First Federal MHC. Federal Reserve Board regulations would likely prevent an acquisition of Kentucky First other than by another mutual holding company or a mutual institution.\nThere may be a limited market for our common stock which may lower our stock price.\nAlthough our shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, there is no guarantee that the shares will be regularly traded. If an active trading market for our common stock does not develop, you may not be able to sell all of your shares of common stock on short notice and the sale of a large number of shares at one time could temporarily depress the market price.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky to make capital distributions to Kentucky First and the waiver of dividends by First Federal MHC.\nOur long-term ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is based primarily upon the ability of the Banks to make capital distributions to Kentucky First, and also on the availability of cash at the holding company level in the event earnings are not sufficient to pay dividends according to the cash dividend payout policy. Under Office of the Comptroller of the Currency safe harbor regulations, the Banks may each distribute to Kentucky First capital not exceeding net retained income for the current calendar year and the prior two calendar years. First Federal MHC owns a majority of Kentucky First\u2019s outstanding stock. First Federal MHC has historically waived its right to dividends on the Kentucky First common shares it owns, in which case the amount of dividends paid to public stockholders is significantly higher than it would be if First Federal MHC accepted dividends. First Federal MHC is not required to waive dividends, but Kentucky First expects this practice to continue, subject to member and regulatory approval annually. First Federal MHC is required to obtain a waiver from the Federal Reserve Board allowing it to waive its right to dividends.\nThe Federal Reserve Board in 2011 issued regulations that govern the activities of Kentucky First and First Federal MHC and the regulations were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2011. Under Section 239.8(d) of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation MM governing dividend waivers, a mutual holding company may waive its right to dividends on shares of its subsidiary if the mutual holding company gives written notice of the waiver to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Board does not object. For a company such as First Federal MHC that waived dividends prior to December 1, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board may not object to a dividend waiver if such waiver would not be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the savings association subsidiary and the board of directors of the mutual holding company expressly determines that such dividend waiver is consistent with the board\u2019s fiduciary duties to the members of the mutual holding company.\nTo address concerns with respect to the conflict of interest created by dividend waivers, Regulation MM requires the board of directors of the mutual holding company to adopt a resolution that describes the conflict of interest that exists because of a director\u2019s ownership of stock in the subsidiary declaring the dividends and any actions the mutual holding company board have taken to eliminate the conflict of interest, such as the directors\u2019 waiving their right to receive dividends. Also, the resolution must contain an affirmation that a majority of the mutual members eligible to vote have, within the 12 months prior to the declaration date of the dividend, voted to approve the waiver of dividends.\nFirst Federal MHC has received Federal Reserve Board approval to waive quarterly dividends totaling $0.40 per share annually beginning with the dividend paid on September 28, 2012 and continuing through the dividend payable in the third quarter of 2021. It is expected that First Federal MHC will continue to waive future dividends, except to the extent dividends are needed to fund First Federal MHC\u2019s continuing operations, subject to the ability of First Federal MHC to obtain regulatory approval of its requests to waive dividends and to its ability to obtain member approval of dividend waivers.\nWe cannot predict whether members will continue to approve annual dividend waiver requests or whether the Federal Reserve Board will grant future dividend waiver requests and, if granted, there can be no assurance as to the conditions, if any, the Federal Reserve Board will place on future dividend waiver requests by grandfathered mutual holding companies such as First Federal MHC. If First Federal MHC is unable to waive the receipt of dividends, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be substantially impaired and the amounts of any such dividends may be significantly reduced.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nOur security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our or our customers\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage.\nSecurity breaches in our Internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our Internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard Internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to our reputation and our business.\nOur security measures may not protect us from systems failures or interruptions. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect that the implementation of a new accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Kentucky First, First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and provide for the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which we expect could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and will likely greatly increase the data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are required to impair our goodwill, intangibles, or other long lived assets, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nPursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other and ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, we are required to perform an annual impairment review of goodwill, intangibles and other long lived assets which could result in an impairment charge if it is determined that the carrying value of the assets are in excess of the fair value. We perform the impairment test annually during our fourth fiscal quarter. Goodwill, intangibles and other long lived assets are also tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists. When changes in circumstances, such as changes in the variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate fair value indicate the carrying amount of certain assets may not be recoverable, the assets are evaluated for impairment. If actual operating results differ from these assumptions, it may result in an asset impairment. As of June 30, 2020, management early adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the required method for estimating the fair value of the Company. During its most recent evaluation, management identified the existence of and recorded a $13.6 million impairment charge. Future write-downs of intangibles and other long lived assets could affect certain of the financial covenants under our debt agreements, could restrict our financial flexibility, and would impact our results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and such effects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\nGlobal health concerns relating to the COVID-19 outbreak and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the outbreak has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or stay-at-home orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Such measures have significantly contributed to rising unemployment and negatively impacted consumer and business spending. Local jurisdictions have subsequently lifted stay-at-home orders and moved to phased reopening of businesses, although capacity restrictions and health and safety recommendations that encourage continued physical distancing and teleworking have limited the ability of businesses to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity. The United States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus, including the passage of the CARES Act, but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion.\nThe outbreak has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our borrowers, customers and business partners. In particular, we may experience financial losses due to a number of operational factors impacting us or our borrowers, customers or business partners, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf Demand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u25cf Credit losses resulting from financial stress being experienced by our borrowers as a result of the outbreak and related governmental actions, particularly in the hospitality, energy, retail and restaurant industries, but across other industries as well;\n\u25cf If the economy is unable to substantially reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charge-offs and reduced income;\n\u25cf Collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u25cf Our allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u25cf The net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u25cf As the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s target federal funds rate, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u25cf A material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate of our quarterly cash dividend;\n\u25cf Operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions.\n\u25cf Increased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online and remote activity;\n\u25cf A prolonged weakness in economic conditions resulting in a reduction of future projected earnings could result in our recording a valuation allowance against our current outstanding deferred tax assets;\n\u25cf We rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on us; and\n\u25cf Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs.\nThe pandemic has introduced increasing uncertainty around the local and national economy. Regulatory treatment of loan deferrals has been changed to encourage loan deferrals. Although the deferrals may lessen credit losses in the long run, they make our credit metrics less transparent, timely and useful. The increased volume of loan related work including processing deferrals, processing PPP loan requests and changing regulations increases inherent credit risks, and loans with deferred payments are more likely to default in the future. The Company believes there could be potential stresses on liquidity management as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As customers manage their own liquidity stress, we could experience an increase in the utilization of existing lines of credit.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, and developing work from home and social distancing plans for our employees), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.\nThe extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy as a whole.", "PERMNO": 90636, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "KFFB"}
