{"cik": "914329", "company": "FEI CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider such risks and uncertainties, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings and public disclosures. In addition, if any of the following risks and uncertainties, or if any other risks and uncertainties, actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in such industries.\nThe industries in which we operate are intensely competitive. Established companies, both domestic and foreign, compete with us in each of our product lines. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do and may price their products very aggressively. In addition, these competitors may be willing to operate at a less profitable level than at which we would expect to operate. Our significant competitors include, among others: JEOL Ltd., Carl Zeiss SMT A.G., Hitachi High Technologies Corporation and Tescan, a.s. In addition, some of our competitors have formed collaborative relationships and otherwise may cooperate with each other.\nTo compete successfully, we must succeed in our R&D efforts, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. Our R&D efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers. Our R&D investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our products. These types of events could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce revenue, increase costs, lower gross margin percentages, or require us to impair our assets.\nThe identity and composition of our competitors may change as we increase our focus on application-specific workflows and new market opportunities, such as the oil and gas services sector. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors, but also from other established competitors with stronger technological, marketing and sales positions in those markets.\nOur customers must make a substantial investment to install and integrate capital equipment into their laboratories and process applications. For example, once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor\u2019s capital equipment, the manufacturer generally relies on that equipment for a specific production line or process control application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor. Accordingly, if a particular customer selects a competitor\u2019s capital equipment, we expect to experience difficulty selling to that customer for a significant period of time.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nprice;\n\u2022\nproduct quality;\n\u2022\nbreadth of product line;\n\u2022\nsystem performance;\n\u2022\nease of use;\n\u2022\ntype and breadth of product applications;\n\u2022\ncost of ownership;\n\u2022\nglobal technical service and support;\n\u2022\nsuccess in developing or otherwise introducing new products; and\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully on these or other factors, which could negatively impact our revenues, gross margins and net income in the future.\nBecause many of our shipments occur in the last month of a quarter, we are at risk of one or more transactions not being delivered according to forecast.\nWe have historically shipped approximately 70% of our products in the last month of each quarter. In addition, we rely on a significant amount of turns business (revenue from tools booked and sold in the same quarter) in any given quarter. As any one sale may be significant to meeting our quarterly sales projection (as our average selling price for a tool is over $1 million), any slippage of shipments into a subsequent quarter may result in our not meeting our quarterly sales projection, which may adversely impact our results of operations for the quarter.\nBecause we have significant operations outside of the U.S., we are subject to political, economic and other international conditions that could result in increased operating expenses and regulation of our products and increased difficulty in maintaining operating and financial controls.\nBecause a significant portion of our operations occur outside of the U.S., our revenues and expenses are impacted by foreign economic and regulatory conditions. Approximately 68%, 72% and 67% of our sales occurred outside the U.S. and Canada in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We have manufacturing facilities in Brno, Czech Republic, Eindhoven, The Netherlands and Munich, Germany and sales offices in many other countries. Over 80% of our products are manufactured in Europe.\nMoreover, we operate in over 50 countries, including in 26 where we have a direct presence, and we are seeking to establish a direct presence in additional countries. Some of our global operations are geographically isolated, are distant from corporate headquarters and/or have little infrastructure support. Therefore, maintaining and enforcing operating and financial controls can be difficult. Failure to maintain or enforce controls could have a material adverse effect on our control over service inventories, quality of service, customer relationships and financial reporting.\nOur exposure to the business risks presented by foreign economies will increase to the extent we continue to expand our global operations. International operations will continue to subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles;\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;\n\u2022\nprice and currency exchange rates and controls;\n\u2022\ntaxes and tariffs;\n\u2022\nexport restrictions;\n\u2022\nbusiness practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ntravel and transportation difficulties resulting from actual or perceived health risks;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment in countries where we do business, which could lead to delays in the importation of products into those countries;\n\u2022\nEuropean Union Regulation of Hazardous Substances (\"RoHS\") which could create problems in manufacture and delivery of certain products in Europe;\n\u2022\nthe implementation and administration of the Control of Electronic Information Products (often referred to as China RoHS) regulations, which could lead to delays in the importation of products into China;\n\u2022\nsecurity concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political and economic instability and terrorist activity;\n\u2022\nrisk of failure of internal controls and failure to detect unauthorized transactions; and\n\u2022\ndiffering employment practices and labor issues.\nThe industries in which we sell our products are cyclical, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate and changes in product demands from our customers may increase volatility and adversely impact our ability to forecast revenues.\nOur business depends in large part on the capital expenditures of customers within our Industry Group and Science Group. See \u201cNet Sales by Segment\u201d included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe largest part of our Industry Group is revenue derived from the semiconductor industry. This industry is cyclical and has experienced significant economic downturns at various times in the last decade. Such downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity. A downturn in this industry, or the businesses of one or more of our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. During downturns, our sales and gross profit margins generally decline. In addition, the continued adoption of our near-line product solutions, which involves the sale of higher priced tools and longer lead times, has increased the volatility of our sales to this industry and our ability to accurately forecast revenues.\nA significant portion of our Science Group revenue is dependent on government investments in research and development of new technology. To the extent that governments, especially in Europe or the U.S., reduce their spending in response to budget deficits and debt limitations, demand for our products could be affected. The funding cycles for our customers tend to extend over multiple quarters and several countries have reaffirmed their commitment to scientific research, but the longer-term impact of potential government fiscal austerity measures on our growth rate cannot be determined at this time. We have also seen a slowing of orders in China as their government has implemented new anti-corruption rules which has extended the time for institutions to place new orders, impacting our Science Group.\nAs a capital equipment provider, our revenues depend in large part on the spending patterns of our customers, who could delay expenditures or cancel orders in reaction to variations in their businesses or general economic conditions. Because a high proportion of our costs are fixed, we have a limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to revenue shortfalls. In a prolonged economic downturn, we may not be able to reduce our significant fixed costs, such as manufacturing overhead, capital equipment or research and development costs, which may cause our gross margins to erode and our earnings to decline.\nOur acquisition and investment strategy subjects us to risks associated with evaluating and pursuing these opportunities and integrating these businesses.\nIn addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources, we may also seek to acquire new technologies or operations from external sources. On February 5, 2014 we acquired Lithicon AS, a provider of digital rock technology services and pore-scale micro computed tomography equipment to oil and gas companies worldwide.\nAcquisitions can involve numerous risks, including management issues and costs in connection with the integration of the operations and personnel, technologies and products of the acquired companies, legal and intellectual property issues, failure to properly integrate acquisitions, the possible write-downs of impaired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. The inability to effectively manage any of these risks could seriously harm our business. Additionally, difficulties in integrating our acquisitions into our internal control structure could result in a failure of our internal controls over financial reporting, which, in turn, could create a material weakness.\nTo the extent we make investments in entities that we control, or have significant influence in, our financial results will reflect our proportionate share of the financial results of the entity.\nIf our customers cancel or reschedule orders or if an anticipated order for even one of our systems is not received in time to permit shipping during a certain fiscal period, our operating results for that fiscal period may fluctuate and our business and financial results for such period could be materially and adversely affected. Cancellation risks rise in periods of economic uncertainty.\nOur customers are able to cancel or reschedule orders, generally with limited or no penalties, depending on the product\u2019s stage of completion. The amount of purchase orders at any particular date, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of sales to be made in any given period. In addition, we derive a substantial portion of our net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high-priced systems, with a large portion in the last month of the quarter. As a result, the timing of revenue recognition for a single transaction could have a material effect on our revenue and results of operations for a particular fiscal period.\nOur build cycle, or the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications, typically ranges from one to six months. During this period, the customer may cancel the order, although generally we will be entitled to receive a cancellation fee based on the agreed-upon shipment schedule. During 2014 and 2013, we experienced cancellations of $10.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively. Further, in some cases, our customers have to make changes to their facilities to accommodate the site requirements for our systems and may reschedule their orders because of the time required to complete these facility changes and for other reasons. This is particularly true of our high-performance TEMs.\nOur orders have longer lead times resulting in more orders scheduled for delivery of goods or services beyond 12 months, and the size of individual orders has increased due to our customers ordering higher priced tools and multiple tool orders as well as multi-year service contracts, which may increase the volatility of our future revenue.\nDue to these and other factors, our net revenues and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future on a quarterly and annual basis. It is possible that in some future quarter or quarters our results of operations will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. In such event, the market price of our common stock may decline significantly.\nDue to our extensive international operations and sales, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro and Czech koruna. For 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 28%, 29% and 27% of our revenue was denominated in euros, respectively, while more than half of our expenses were denominated in euros, Czech koruna, yen or other foreign currencies. Particularly as a result of this imbalance, changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, principally the euro, Czech koruna and Japanese yen, can impact our revenues, gross margins, results of operations and cash flows. We undertake hedging transactions primarily to limit our exposure to changes in the dollar/euro and dollar/Czech koruna exchange rates. The hedges are designed to protect us as the dollar weakens but also provide us with some flexibility if the dollar strengthens.\nAchieving hedge designation is based on evaluating the effectiveness of the derivative contracts\u2019 ability to mitigate the foreign currency exposure of the linked transaction. We are required to monitor the effectiveness of all new and open derivative contracts designated as hedges on a quarterly basis. Failure to meet the hedge accounting requirements could result in the requirement to record unrealized gains and losses into net income in the current period. This failure could result in significant fluctuations in operating results. In addition, we will continue to recognize unrealized gains and losses related to the changes in fair value of derivative contracts not designated as hedges in the current period net income. Accordingly, the related impact to operating results may be recognized in a different period than the foreign currency impact of the hedged transaction.\nWe also enter into foreign forward exchange contracts that are designed to partially mitigate the impact of specific cash, receivables or payables positions denominated in foreign currencies. See Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part II, Item 7A., \"Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe volatility of dollar/euro and dollar/Czech koruna exchange rates can make it more difficult for us to deploy our hedging program and create effective hedges or to achieve the desired outcome.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nThe future economic climate may be less favorable than that of the past. Any slowdown in global economic conditions has led, and could lead, to reduced consumer and business spending in the future, including by our customers and the purchasers of their products and services. If such spending slows down or decreases, our industry, business and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Also, in times of economic distress, hardship, bankruptcy and insolvency among our customers could increase. This may make it more difficult to collect on receivables.\nOur gross margin improvement strategy is dependent on multiple factors that, if not achieved, could hinder our ability to reach our gross margin targets.\nOur gross margins are dependent on many factors, some of which are not directly controlled by the company. These factors are:\n\u2022\nsignificant variation in our gross margin among products. Any substantial change in product mix could change our gross margin;\n\u2022\nvolatility of sales to our Industry Group customers contribute, on average, a higher proportion of our gross margin. Any significant downturn affecting these customers would have a negative impact on our gross margin;\n\u2022\npricing and acceptance of higher-margin new products;\n\u2022\nrealization of manufacturing efficiencies from our new facilities;\n\u2022\nrealization of material cost savings through migration of the supply chain to lower cost suppliers and re-engineering of existing products;\n\u2022\ncontinued improvement in gross margins from our installed base; and\n\u2022\nmovements in foreign currency exchange rates and impact of hedging.\nOur inability to control any one of these factors could result in us not achieving our gross margin targets and could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur business is complex, and changes to the business may not achieve their desired benefits.\nOur business is based on a myriad of technologies, encompassed in multiple different product lines, addressing various customers in a range of markets in different regions of the world. A business of our breadth and complexity requires significant management time, attention and resources. In addition, significant changes to our business, such as changes in manufacturing, operations, product lines, market focus or organizational structure or focus, can be distracting, time-consuming and expensive. These changes can have short-term adverse effects on our financial results. Moreover, we operate through various foreign subsidiaries that are subject to local corporate, labor and other laws. Specifically, the requirements that certain actions of our subsidiaries are subject to approval by local workers councils and supervisory boards could impair the company's ability to take various actions and could result in unanticipated additional expense and delays.\nIn addition, the complexity of product lines and diversity of our customer base creates manufacturing planning and control challenges that may lead to higher costs of materials and labor, increased service costs, delayed shipments and excessive inventory. Our products incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software components. Software may contain bugs that unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, which may interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins. Failure to effectively manage these manufacturing and product testing issues may materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide certain key parts and components. Failure of any of these suppliers to provide us with quality products in a timely manner could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.\nFailure of critical suppliers of parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to us in a timely and cost-effective manner could negatively affect our business, including our ability to convert backlog into revenue. Although we currently use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture and support of our products, some key parts may only be obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. In particular, we rely on: VDL Enabling Technologies Group, NTS Group, Frencken Mechatronics B.V., Keller Technology, Schneeberger AG, Prodrive Technologies and AZD Praha s.r.o. for our supply of mechanical parts and subassemblies; Gatan, Inc., Edax Inc. and Bruker Corp. for critical accessory products; and Neways Electronics, N.V. for some of our electronic subassemblies. A portion of the subcomponents that make up the components and sub-assemblies supplied to us are proprietary in nature and are provided to our suppliers only from single sources. We monitor those parts subject to single or a limited source supply to seek to minimize factory down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could impact our ability to meet manufacturing schedules. In addition, some of our suppliers rely on sole suppliers. As a result of this concentration of key suppliers, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we do not timely and cost-effectively receive a sufficient quantity of quality parts to meet our production requirements or if we are required to find alternative suppliers for these supplies. We may not be able to expand our supplier group or to reduce our dependence on single suppliers. If our suppliers are not able to meet our supply requirements, constraints may affect our ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, restrictions regulating the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment in various jurisdictions may impact parts and component availability or our electronics suppliers\u2019 ability to source parts and components in a timely and cost-effective manner. Overall, because we only have a few equipment suppliers, we may be more exposed to future cost increases for this equipment.\nOur maintenance and repair revenue depends on our ability to reliably supply replacement parts and consumables to our customers and failure to deliver high quality parts and consumables in a timely manner could cause our business to suffer.\nOur installed base of approximately 10,000 tools includes diverse products of varying ages, configurations, use cases, condition, and customer requirements and is dispersed in approximately 50 countries around the globe. Providing logistical support for delivery of spare parts and consumables to these tools, particularly the older tools, can be difficult. We have attempted to address the complexity of our maintenance and repair requirements, in part, through a remote diagnostics system that allows us to remotely access tools through a virtual private network. If we are unable to effectively manage and support the supply and delivery of spare parts and consumables to our customers we may damage our reputation and business.\nOur business relies on various electronic data systems and their functioning is important to our business. Our business could be damaged if those systems fail or suffer a security breach or compromise.\nGlobal privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. We use a number of electronic data systems to help operate our business. If we are unable to maintain and safeguard our electronic data, our operating activities, financial reporting and intellectual property could be compromised, which may disrupt operations, harm our reputation and damage customer relationships. Further, we maintain personal information of our employees and a data breach that leads to the misuse or misappropriation of this information could cause the company to incur liability and damage our relationship with our employees and our reputation. Moreover, if we suffer an unauthorized intrusion into our own systems or the\nvirtual private network providing for remote tool diagnostics at customer sites, we, or our customers, may suffer a loss of proprietary information that could create liability for us and undermine our business. Further, if our systems are inaccessible for a period of time, it may compromise our ability to perform business functions in a timely manner. Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. Our failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\nWe depend on certain business processes for order entry and failure to adhere to those processes could impair our ability to properly book and fulfill orders.\nWe use business processes, including automated systems, to enter and track customer orders. Failure to adhere to these processes could result in errors in bookings, discounts on tool sales and failure to meet our global export compliance obligations. Further, inaccurate bookings information could lead to delays in shipping and having to rework orders. These problems could, in turn, cause us to suffer reduced margins, delayed revenue and governmental fines and penalties.\nOur sales contracts often require delivery of multiple elements with complex terms and conditions that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.\nOur system sales contracts include multiple elements such as delivery of more than one system, installation obligations (sometimes for multiple tools), accessories and/or service contracts, as well as provisions for customer acceptance. Typically, we recognize revenue as the various elements are delivered to the customer or the related services are provided. However, certain of these contracts have complex terms and conditions or technical specifications that require us to deliver most, or sometimes all, elements under the contract before revenue can be recognized. This could result in a significant delay between production and delivery of products and when revenue is recognized, which may cause volatility in, or adversely impact, our quarterly results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of one or more of our key customers would result in the loss of significant net revenues.\nIn 2014, 2013 and 2012, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 27%, 25%, and 22% of our total annual net revenue, respectively. One customer accounted for just over 10% of total annual net revenue during 2013 and no customers accounted for 10% or more of total annual net revenue in 2014 and 2012. Our business will be seriously harmed if we do not generate as much revenue as we expect from these key customers, if we experience a loss of any of our key customers or if we suffer a substantial reduction in orders from these customers. Our ability to continue to generate revenues from our key customers will depend on our ability to introduce new products that are desirable to these customers.\nCertain of our significant customers have adopted policies relating to sustainability, supply chain management, disaster recovery and other initiatives that may result in significant additional costs depending on the actions we must take in order to comply. Our failure to comply with such policies and initiatives could result in loss of customer contracts or relationships, resulting in significant harm to our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights, especially in foreign countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends in large part on the protection of our proprietary rights. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology, products and services. We incur significant costs to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights and to defend our intellectual property. We also rely on the laws of the U.S. and other countries where we develop, manufacture or sell products and services to protect our proprietary rights. We may not be successful in protecting these proprietary rights, these rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect or other parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent these rights. More specifically, we depend on trade secrets used in the development and manufacture of our products and delivery of our services. We endeavor to protect these trade secrets, but the measures taken to protect them may be inadequate or ineffective. These risks may increase as we focus on application-specific workflows and certain market opportunities, such as those in the oil and gas services sector, where key aspects of our technology may be made publicly available to competitors and new market entrants.\nFurther, our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as they are in the U.S. Many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries. Approximately 68%, 72% and 67% of our sales occurred outside the U.S. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these countries, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nInfringement of our proprietary rights could result in weakened capacity to compete for sales and increased litigation costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, product gross margins, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nSeveral of our competitors hold patents or other intellectual property rights covering a variety of technologies that may be included in some of our products and services. In addition, some of our customers may use our products for applications that are similar to those covered by these patents or other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we, and our respective customers, have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products, as sold by us or used by our customers, may be infringing one or more of these patents or other intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement from a third party, even one without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, and could distract our management from running the business.\nIn addition, our competitors or other entities, including non-practicing entities, may assert infringement claims against us or our customers in the future with respect to current or future products or uses, and these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others. Additionally, if claims of infringement are asserted against our customers, those customers may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses they incur.\nIf we become subject to additional infringement claims, we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question, developing non-infringing technology or defending our position. These licenses, however, may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all. If we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, develop non-infringing technology or successfully defend our position, these potential infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions due to our lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risk.\nIf we are unable to pay quarterly dividends or repurchase our stock at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.\nIn September 2010, our Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase up to a total of 4.0 million shares of our common stock for which we have repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares to date. In June 2012, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of quarterly cash dividends to holders of our common stock. The declaration and payment of dividends to shareholders in the future is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and capital availability. Dividends have been paid under this program each quarter since its inception in June 2012. The dividend and stock repurchase program may require the use of a significant portion of our cash earnings. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or finance future growth opportunities, new product development initiatives and unanticipated capital expenditures. Further, our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be limited at any time. Our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Any failure to pay dividends or repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.\nRestructuring activities may be disruptive to our business and financial performance. Any delay or failure by us to execute planned cost reductions could also be disruptive and could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected.\nFrom time to time, we have engaged in various restructuring and infrastructure improvement programs in order to increase operational efficiency, consolidate sites, reduce costs and balance the effects of currency fluctuations on our financial results. These actions have included reductions of work-force, site consolidations, and migrating portions of our supply chain to dollar-linked contracts.\nRestructuring has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations due to potential disruption of manufacturing operations, our supply chain and other aspects of our business. Employee morale and productivity could also suffer and result in unintended employee attrition. Loss of sales, service and engineering talent, in particular, could damage our business. Restructuring requires substantial management time and attention and has the potential to divert management from other important work. Moreover, we could encounter delays in executing our plans, which could cause further disruption and additional unanticipated expense. Some of our employees work in areas, such as Europe and Asia, where workforce reductions are highly regulated, and this could slow the implementation of planned workforce reductions. Restructuring plans may also fail to achieve the stated aims for reasons similar to those described in this paragraph.\nDuring the course of executing a restructuring, we could incur material non-cash charges such as write-downs of inventories or other tangible assets. We test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. If we record an impairment charge as a result of this analysis, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nBecause we do not have long-term contracts with our customers, our customers may stop purchasing our products at any time, which makes it difficult to forecast our results of operations and to plan expenditures accordingly.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with our customers. Accordingly:\n\u2022\ncustomers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty;\n\u2022\ncustomers may cancel orders that they previously placed;\n\u2022\ncustomers may purchase products from our competitors;\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to competitive pricing pressure on each order; and\n\u2022\ncustomers are not required to make minimum purchases.\nIf we do not succeed in obtaining new sales orders from new and existing customers, our results of operations will be negatively impacted.\nMany of our projects are funded under various government contracts and if we are found to have violated the terms of the government contracts or applicable statutes and regulations, we are subject to the risk of suspension or debarment from government contracting activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nMany of our projects are funded under various government contracts worldwide. Government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and requirements relating to the formation, administration, performance and accounting of these contracts. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions. As a result of our government contracting, claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the government for violations of these regulations, requirements or statutes. Further, if we fail to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from government contracting or subcontracting, including federally funded projects at the state level. If one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended from government work, we could suffer the loss of future contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges and fluctuations in government spending priorities and procurement practices could adversely affect our revenue.\nBecause a significant part of our overall business is generated either directly or indirectly as a result of international, national and local government regulatory and infrastructure priorities, shifts in these priorities due to changes in policy imperatives or economic conditions or government administration, which are often unpredictable, may affect our revenues.\nPolitical instability in key regions around the world, the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to military-related expenditures and current uncertainty around global sovereign debt put at risk federal discretionary spending, including spending on nanotechnology research programs and projects that are of particular importance to our business. Also, changes in U.S. Congressional appropriations practices could result in decreased funding for some of our customers. At the state and local levels, the need to compensate for reductions in federal matching funds, as well as financing of federal unfunded mandates, creates strong pressures to cut back on research expenditures as well. A potential reduction of federal funding may adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, procurement practices and procedures vary widely in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and changes in these practices and procedures could cause delay in obtaining orders and revenue. The anti-corruption measures undertaken by the Chinese government in its procurement practices have caused some delay in orders and revenue from Chinese government-controlled or related entities and these orders and revenue may continue to be delayed to the extent that these anti-corruption measures continue to be undertaken by the Chinese government.\nWe have long sales cycles for our systems, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\nOur sales cycle can be 18 months or longer and is unpredictable. Variations in the length of our sales cycle could cause our net sales and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations, operating margins and cash flows, to fluctuate widely from period to period. These variations could be based on factors partially or completely outside of our control.\nThe length of time it takes us to complete a sale depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efforts of our sales force and our independent sales representatives;\n\u2022\nchanges in the composition of our sales force, including the departure of senior sales personnel;\n\u2022\nthe history of previous sales to a customer;\n\u2022\nthe complexity of the customer\u2019s manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nthe introduction, or announced introduction, of new products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe economic environment;\n\u2022\nthe internal technical capabilities and sophistication of the customer; and\n\u2022\nthe capital expenditure budget cycle of the customer.\nOur sales cycle also extends in situations where the sale involves developing new applications for a system or technology. As a result of these and a number of other factors that could influence sales cycles with particular customers, the period between initial contact with a potential customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer, if we ever do, may vary widely.\nThe loss of key management or our inability to attract and retain managerial, engineering and other technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAttracting qualified personnel is difficult, and our recruiting efforts may not be successful. Specifically, our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified engineers, the market for which is very competitive. In addition, experienced management and technical, sales, marketing and service personnel in the technology industry are in high demand, and competition for such talent is intense. The loss of key personnel, or our inability to attract key personnel, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur customers experience rapid technological changes, with which we must keep pace. We may be unable to properly ascertain new market needs, or introduce new products responsive to those needs, on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nCustomers in each of our Groups experience rapid technological change that requires new product introductions and enhancements. Our ability to remain competitive depends in large part on our ability to understand these changes and develop, in a timely and cost-effective manner, new and enhanced systems at competitive prices that respond to, and accurately predict, new market requirements. We may fail to ascertain and respond to the needs of our customers or fail to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that meet their needs, which could adversely affect our financial position. In addition, new product introductions or enhancements by competitors could cause a decline in our sales or a loss of market acceptance of our existing products. Increased competitive pressure also could lead to intensified price competition, resulting in lower margins, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success in developing, introducing and selling new and enhanced systems depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nselection and development of product offerings;\n\u2022\ntimely and efficient completion of product design and development;\n\u2022\ntimely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\neffective sales, service and marketing functions; and\n\u2022\nproduct performance.\nBecause new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales, new product decisions must anticipate both the future demand for products under development and the equipment required to produce such products. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in selecting, developing, manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products. On occasion, certain product and application developments have taken longer than expected. These delays can have an adverse effect on product shipments and results of operations.\nThe process of developing new high technology capital equipment products and services is complex and uncertain, and failure to accurately anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends, to complete engineering and development projects in a timely manner and to develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property could significantly harm our results of operations. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will result in products that the market will accept.\nTo the extent that a market does not develop for a new product, we may decide to discontinue or modify the product. These actions could involve significant costs and/or require us to take charges in future periods. If these products are accepted by the marketplace, sales of our new products may cannibalize sales of our existing products. Further, after a product is developed, we must be able to manufacture sufficient volume quickly and at low cost. To accomplish this objective, we must accurately forecast production volumes, mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements. If we are not successful in making accurate forecasts, our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed.\nWe may have exposure to income tax rate fluctuations as well as to additional tax liabilities, which would impact our financial position.\nAs a corporation with operations both in the U.S. and abroad, we are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant fluctuation from one period to the next as the income tax rates for each year are a function of the following factors, among others:\n\u2022\nthe effects of a mix of profits or losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in numerous foreign tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates;\n\u2022\nour ability to utilize recorded deferred tax assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in uncertain tax positions, interest or penalties resulting from tax audits; and\n\u2022\nchanges in tax rates and laws or the interpretation of such laws.\nChanges in the mix of these items and other items may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to both income and non-income taxes and may have exposure to additional tax liabilities as a result of these audits.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nMany of our current and planned products are highly complex and may contain defects or errors that can only be detected after installation, which may harm our reputation and damage our business.\nOur products are highly complex, and our extensive product development, manufacturing and testing processes may not be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us. As a result, we could have to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products after they are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers and other losses to us or to our customers. These occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Also, our ability to recognize revenue that has been deferred on sales of new products could be negatively impacted if all conditions for revenue recognition are not met.\nSome of our systems use hazardous gases and high voltage power supplies as well as emit x-rays, which, if not properly contained, could result in property damage, bodily injury and death.\nA product safety failure, such as a hazardous gas release, high voltage power supply problem, x-ray leak or extreme pressure release, could result in substantial liability and could also significantly damage customer relationships and our reputation and disrupt future sales. Moreover, remediation could require redesign of the tools involved, creating additional expense, increasing tool costs and damaging sales. In addition, a product safety failure could involve significant litigation that would divert management time and resources and cause unanticipated legal expense. Further, if such a failure involved violation of health and safety laws, we may suffer substantial fines and penalties in addition to the other damage suffered. Finally, failure to properly manage the regulatory requirements for shipment of dangerous products could cause delays in clearing customs and thereby cause delay or loss of revenue in any particular quarter.\nNatural disasters, catastrophic events, terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business and revenues, costs and expenses and financial condition.\nOur worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, telecommunications failures, power interruptions, water shortages, closure of transport routes, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics, terrorist acts, acts of war and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions. For many of these events we carry no insurance. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and\nfinancial condition and increase our costs and expenses. The impact of such events could be disproportionately greater on us than on other companies as a result of our significant international presence. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located on the Pacific coast, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults. We rely on major logistics hubs, primarily in Europe, Asia and the U.S. to manufacture and distribute our products and to move products to customers in various regions. Our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including those described above. The ultimate impact of our consolidation in certain geographical areas on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure is unknown, but our revenue, profitability and financial condition could suffer in the event of a catastrophic event.\nUnforeseen health, safety and environmental costs could impact our future net earnings.\nSome of our operations use substances that are regulated by various federal, state and international laws governing health, safety and the environment. We could be subject to liability if we do not handle these substances in compliance with safety standards for storage and transportation and applicable laws. We will record a liability for any costs related to health, safety or environmental remediation when we consider the costs to be probable and the amount of the costs can be reasonably estimated.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad, and the U.S. Congress may prevent proposed sales to foreign customers.\nWe are subject to export control laws that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our products. Moreover, export licenses are required from government agencies for some of our products and accessories in accordance with various statutory authorities, including U.S. statutes such as the Export Administration Act of 1979, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. Depending on the shipment, we are also subject to Dutch or Czech law regarding export controls and licensing requirements. We may not be successful in obtaining these necessary licenses in order to conduct business abroad. In addition, we may suffer from process failures that would cause us to violate export laws. Failure to comply with applicable export controls or the termination or significant limitation on our ability to export certain of our products would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may affect how we conduct our business.\nChanges in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future. New rules, changes to existing rules, or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or change the way we conduct our business.\nProvisions of our charter documents, our shareholder rights plan and Oregon law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our shareholders.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has also adopted a shareholder rights plan, or \u201cpoison pill,\u201d which would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer. In addition, the Oregon Control Share Act and the Oregon Business Combination Act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us. These provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of our Board of Directors, may deter efforts to obtain control of us and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 81705, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "FEIC"}
