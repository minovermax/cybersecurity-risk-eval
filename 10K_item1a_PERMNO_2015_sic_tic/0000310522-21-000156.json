Risk Factors\nRisk Factors Summary:\nThe summary of risks below provides an overview of the principal risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. This summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the more detailed discussion of risks that follows this summary.\nGSE and Conservatorship Risk\n\u2022The future of our company is uncertain.\n\u2022Our business activities are significantly affected by the conservatorship and the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and could be significantly impacted by the enterprise regulatory capital framework.\n\u2022Our regulator is authorized or required to place us into receivership under specified conditions, which would result in our liquidation, and FHFA, acting as receiver, proceeding to realize on our assets. Amounts recovered by our receiver from these actions may not be sufficient to repay the liquidation preference of any series of our preferred stock or to provide any proceeds to common shareholders.\n\u2022Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to retain and recruit well-qualified executives and other employees. The conservatorship, the uncertainty of our future and limitations on our executive and employee compensation put us at a disadvantage compared to many other companies with which we compete for talent.\n\u2022Pursuing our housing goals and duty to serve obligations may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022The conservatorship and agreements with Treasury adversely affect our common and preferred shareholders.\n\u2022The liquidity and market value of our MBS could be adversely affected by developments in the UMBS market, including those connected with our or Freddie Mac\u2019s exit from conservatorship.\n\u2022Our issuance of UMBS and structured securities backed by Freddie Mac-issued securities has increased our operational and counterparty credit risk.\n\u2022Our reliance on CSS and the common securitization platform has increased our counterparty and third-party risk.\n\u2022We are limited in our ability to diversify our business and may be prohibited from undertaking activities that management believes would benefit our business.\n\u2022An active trading market in our equity securities may cease to exist, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common and preferred stock.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risk\n\u2022We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to adversely affect our business and financial results.\nCredit Risk\n\u2022We may incur significant credit losses and credit-related expenses on the loans in our book of business.\n\u2022One or more of our institutional counterparties may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, resulting in financial losses, business disruption and decreased ability to manage risk.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 34\nRisk Factors\n\u2022Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected if mortgage servicers fail to perform their obligations to us.\n\u2022We may incur losses as a result of claims under our mortgage insurance policies not being paid in full or at all.\n\u2022Mortgage fraud could result in significant financial losses and harm to our reputation.\n\u2022We may suffer losses if borrowers are unable to obtain property or flood insurance, if their claims under insurance policies are not paid, or if they suffer property damage as a result of a hazard for which we do not require insurance, such as flooding outside of certain areas.\n\u2022The occurrence of major natural or other disasters in the United States or its territories and the impact of climate change could negatively impact our credit losses and credit-related expenses.\nOperational Risk\n\u2022A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could materially adversely affect our business, impair our liquidity, cause financial losses and harm our reputation.\n\u2022A breach of the security of our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could damage or disrupt our business or result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential information, which could damage our reputation, result in regulatory sanctions and/or increase our costs and cause losses.\n\u2022Our concurrent implementation of multiple new initiatives may increase our operational risk and result in one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\n\u2022Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate.\n\u2022Failure of our models to produce reliable results may adversely affect our ability to manage risk and make effective business decisions.\nLiquidity and Funding Risk\n\u2022Limitations on our ability to access the debt capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations, and our liquidity contingency plans may be difficult or impossible to execute during a sustained liquidity crisis.\n\u2022A decrease in the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt could have an adverse effect on our ability to issue debt on reasonable terms, particularly if such a decrease were not based on a similar action on the credit ratings of the U.S. government. A decrease in our credit ratings also could require that we post additional collateral for our derivatives contracts.\nMarket and Industry Risk\n\u2022Changes in interest rates or our loss of the ability to manage interest-rate risk successfully could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and increase interest-rate risk.\n\u2022Changes in spreads could materially impact our results of operations, net worth and the fair value of our net assets.\n\u2022Uncertainty relating to the potential discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\n\u2022A deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly home prices and employment trends or the financial markets may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\u2022A decline in activity in the U.S. housing market or increasing interest rates could lower our business volumes or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, net worth and financial condition.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\n\u2022Regulatory changes in the financial services industry may negatively impact our business.\n\u2022Legislative, regulatory or judicial actions could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or net worth.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 35\nRisk Factors\nGeneral Risk\n\u2022Our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected by legal or regulatory proceedings.\n\u2022Changes in accounting standards and policies can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial results.\n\u2022In many cases, our accounting policies and methods, which are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management also relies on models in making these estimates.\nRisk Factors\nRefer to \u201cMD&A-Key Market Economic Indicators,\u201d \u201cMD&A-Risk Management,\u201d \u201cMD&A-Single-Family Business\u201d and \u201cMD&A-Multifamily Business\u201d for more detailed descriptions of the primary risks to our business and how we seek to manage those risks.\nThe risks we face could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our past results or the results contemplated by any forward-looking statements we make. We believe the risks described below and in the other sections of this report referenced above are the most significant we face; however, these are not the only risks we face. We face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial.\nGSE and Conservatorship Risk\nThe future of our company is uncertain.\nThe company faces an uncertain future, including how long we will continue to exist in our current form, the extent of our role in the market, the level of government support of our business, how long we will be in conservatorship, what form we will have, what ownership interest, if any, our current common and preferred stockholders will hold in us after the conservatorship is terminated, and whether we will continue to exist following conservatorship. The conservatorship is indefinite in duration and the timing, conditions and likelihood of our emerging from conservatorship are uncertain. Our conservatorship could terminate through a receivership. Termination of the conservatorship, other than in connection with a receivership, requires Treasury\u2019s consent under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement; unless (i) the pending significant lawsuits relating to the amendment of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and/or the conservatorship have been resolved, and (ii) for two or more consecutive quarters, our common equity tier 1 capital, together with any other common stock that we may issue in a public offering, equals or exceeds 3% of our \u201cadjusted total assets\u201d under our enterprise regulatory capital framework. We estimate that, had the new framework been applicable to us as of December 31, 2020, we would have been required to hold approximately $185 billion in adjusted total capital, of which approximately $135 billion must be in the form of common equity tier 1 capital.\nThe current Administration has not articulated a formal position on housing finance reform or the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, although FHFA\u2019s strategic plan for conservatorship, issued in 2019, includes as an objective preparing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for their eventual exits from conservatorship. Actions taken to reform the housing finance system could have a significant impact on our structure, our role in the secondary mortgage market, our capitalization, our business and our competitive environment.\nCongress may consider legislation, or federal agencies such as FHFA may consider regulations or administrative actions, to increase the competition we face, reduce our market share, expand our obligations to provide funds to Treasury, constrain our business operations, or subject us to other obligations that may adversely affect our business. We cannot predict the timing or final content of housing finance reform legislation or other legislation, regulations or administrative actions that will impact our activities, nor can we predict the extent of such impact.\nOur business activities are significantly affected by the conservatorship and the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and could be significantly impacted by the enterprise regulatory capital framework.\nIn conservatorship our business is not managed with a strategy to maximize shareholder returns while fulfilling our mission. As conservator, FHFA can direct us to enter into contracts or enter into contracts on our behalf, and generally has the power to transfer or sell any of our assets or liabilities. In addition, our directors have no fiduciary duties to any person or entity except to the conservator. Accordingly, our directors are not obligated to consider the interests of the company, the holders of our equity or debt securities, or the holders of Fannie Mae MBS in making or approving a decision unless specifically directed to do so by the conservator.\nAs conservator, FHFA can prevent us from engaging in business activities or transactions that we believe would benefit our business and financial results. For example, because FHFA must approve changes to the national loan-level price\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 36\nRisk Factors\nadjustments we charge and can direct us to make other changes to our guaranty fee pricing, our ability to address changing market conditions, pursue certain strategic objectives, or manage the mix of loans we acquire is constrained.\nAdditionally, FHFA may require us to undertake activities that are costly or difficult to implement.\nIn November 2020, FHFA adopted a final rule establishing a new regulatory capital framework for the GSEs. The new regulatory capital framework implements statutory capital requirements and establishes supplemental risk-based and leverage-based capital requirements. Our capital requirements under the enterprise regulatory capital framework may require us to change or limit certain business activities. We may be required to take actions to maintain appropriate risk-adjusted returns, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Additionally, these requirements depend upon the timing of exiting conservatorship.\nEven if we are released from conservatorship, we remain subject to the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury, under which we issued the senior preferred stock and warrant. The senior preferred stock purchase agreement can only be canceled or modified with the consent of Treasury. The agreement includes a number of covenants that significantly restrict our business activities, and new restrictive covenants were added in the January 2021 letter agreement with Treasury that impact both our single-family and multifamily business activities. For example, one covenant provides that we may not acquire a single-family loan if, following its acquisition, in the prior 52-week period, we have acquired single-family loans with specified higher-risk characteristics in excess of the covenant\u2019s thresholds. In addition, we are currently subject to a $300 billion debt limit under our senior preferred stock purchase agreement, which will decrease to $270 billion as of December 31, 2022. The unpaid principal balance of our aggregate indebtedness was $290.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. Because of our debt limit, our business activities may be constrained. For more information about the covenants in the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and their potential impact on our business, see \u201cBusiness-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform-Treasury Agreements-Covenants under Treasury Agreements.\u201d\nOur regulator is authorized or required to place us into receivership under specified conditions, which would result in our liquidation, and FHFA, acting as receiver, proceeding to realize on our assets. Amounts recovered by our receiver from these actions may not be sufficient to repay the liquidation preference of any series of our preferred stock or to provide any proceeds to common shareholders.\nFHFA is required to place us into receivership if the Director of FHFA makes a written determination that our assets are less than our obligations or if we have not been paying our debts as they become due, in either case, for a period of 60 days after the SEC filing deadline for any of our Form 10-Ks or Form 10-Qs. Although Treasury committed to providing us funds in accordance with the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, if we need funding from Treasury to avoid triggering FHFA\u2019s obligation, Treasury may not be able to provide sufficient funds to us within the required 60 days if it has exhausted its borrowing authority, if there is a government shutdown, or if the funding we need exceeds the amount available to us under the agreement. In addition, we could be put into receivership at the discretion of the Director of FHFA at any time for the reasons set forth in the GSE Act, including if our Board or shareholders consent to the appointment of a receiver or, if under the definitions in the GSE Act, we are undercapitalized with no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized or critically undercapitalized. Under the GSE Act, FHFA succeeded to all of the rights, titles, powers and privileges of our board of directors and shareholders. In addition, we have not held sufficient core or total capital to meet the critical capital requirements in the GSE Act since 2008.\nA receivership would terminate the conservatorship. In addition to the powers FHFA has as our conservator, the appointment of FHFA as our receiver would terminate all rights and claims that our shareholders and creditors may have against our assets or under our charter arising from their status as shareholders or creditors, except for their right to payment, resolution or other satisfaction of their claims as permitted under the GSE Act. If we are placed into receivership and do not or cannot fulfill our MBS guaranty obligations, there may be significant delays of any payments to our MBS holders, and the MBS holders could become unsecured creditors of ours with respect to claims made under our guaranty to the extent the mortgage collateral underlying the Fannie Mae MBS is insufficient to satisfy the claims of the MBS holders.\nIn the event of a liquidation of our assets, only after payment of the administrative expenses of the receiver and the immediately preceding conservator, the secured and unsecured claims against the company (including repaying all outstanding debt obligations), and the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock, would any liquidation proceeds be available to repay the liquidation preference on any other series of preferred stock. Finally, only after the liquidation preference on all series of preferred stock is repaid would any liquidation proceeds be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock. In the event of such a liquidation, we can make no assurances that there would be sufficient proceeds to make any distribution to holders of our preferred stock or common stock, other than to Treasury as the holder of our senior preferred stock.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 37\nRisk Factors\nOur business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to retain and recruit well-qualified executives and other employees. The conservatorship, the uncertainty of our future and limitations on our executive and employee compensation put us at a disadvantage compared to many other companies with which we compete for talent.\nOur business is highly dependent on the talents and efforts of our executives and other employees. The conservatorship, the uncertainty of our future and limitations on executive and employee compensation have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on our ability to retain and recruit talent. Attrition in key management positions and challenges in hiring new management could harm our ability to manage our business effectively, to successfully implement strategic initiatives, and ultimately could adversely affect our financial performance.\nActions taken by Congress, FHFA and Treasury to date, or that may be taken by them or other government agencies in the future, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our retention and recruitment of executives and other employees. We are subject to significant restrictions on the amount and type of compensation we may pay while under conservatorship. For example:\n\u2022The Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2015 limits the compensation and benefits for our Chief Executive Officer to the same level in effect as of January 1, 2015 while we are in conservatorship or receivership. Accordingly, annual direct compensation for our Chief Executive Officer is limited to base salary at an annual rate of $600,000.\n\u2022The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, known as the STOCK Act, and related FHFA regulations prohibit our senior executives from receiving bonuses during conservatorship.\n\u2022As our conservator, FHFA has the authority to approve the terms and amount of our executive compensation and may require changes to our executive compensation program. For example:\n\u25e6In 2019, FHFA directed us, for so long as we are in conservatorship, to:\n\u25aaincrease the mandatory deferral period for at-risk deferred salary received by senior vice presidents and above from one year to two years, effective January 1, 2022 for executives hired before January 1, 2020 and effective January 1, 2020 for executives hired or promoted to senior vice president on or after January 1, 2020; and\n\u25aalimit base salaries for all employees to no more than $600,000.\n\u25e6In 2019, FHFA directed us to submit for conservator decision any compensation arrangement for a newly hired employee where the proposed total target direct compensation is $600,000 or above, or any increase in total target direct compensation for an existing employee where the proposed total target direct compensation is $600,000 or above. This directive continues for so long as we are in conservatorship.\n\u25e6For new executive hires and compensation increase requests for executives, FHFA has requested that we target annual direct compensation to the 25th percentile of the market to the extent practicable and subject to appropriate exceptions.\n\u2022The terms of our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury contain specified restrictions relating to compensation, including a prohibition on selling or issuing equity securities without Treasury\u2019s prior written consent except under limited circumstances, which effectively eliminates our ability to offer equity-based compensation to our employees.\nAs a result of the restrictions on our compensation, we have not been able to incent and reward excellent performance with compensation structures that provide upside potential to our executives, which places us at a disadvantage compared to many other companies in attracting and retaining executives. In addition, the restrictions on our compensation and the uncertainty of potential action by Congress or the Administration with respect to our future- including whether we will exit conservatorship, how long it may take before we exit conservatorship, or whether housing finance reform will result in a significant restructuring of the company or the company no longer continuing to exist-also negatively affects our ability to retain and recruit executives and other employees.\nThe cap on our Chief Executive Officer compensation continues to make retention and succession planning for this position difficult, and it may make it difficult to attract qualified candidates for this critical role in the future.\nWe face competition from the financial services and technology industries, and from businesses outside of these industries, for qualified executives and other employees. If we are unable to retain, promote and attract executives and other employees with the necessary skills and talent, we would face increased risks for operational failures. If there were several high-level departures at approximately the same time, our ability to conduct our business could be\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 38\nRisk Factors\nmaterially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPursuing our housing goals and duty to serve obligations may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\nWe are required by the GSE Act to support the housing market in ways that could adversely affect our financial results and condition. For example, we are subject to housing goals that require a portion of the mortgage loans we acquire to be for low- and very low-income families, families in low-income census tracts and moderate-income families in minority census tracts or designated disaster areas. We also have a duty to serve very low-, low- and moderate-income families in three underserved markets: manufactured housing, affordable housing preservation and rural areas. We may take actions to meet our housing goals and duty to serve obligations that could adversely affect our profitability. For example, we may acquire loans that offer lower expected returns or increase our credit losses and credit-related expenses. If we do not meet our housing goals or duty to serve requirements, and FHFA finds that the goals or requirements were feasible, we may become subject to a housing plan with additional requirements that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The potential penalties for failure to comply with housing plan requirements include a cease-and-desist order and civil money penalties. See \u201cBusiness-Legislation and Regulation-GSE Act and Other Legislative and Regulatory Matters\u201d for more information on our housing goals and duty to serve underserved markets.\nThe conservatorship and agreements with Treasury adversely affect our common and preferred shareholders.\nThe material adverse effects of the conservatorship on our shareholders under our agreements with Treasury include the following:\nNo voting rights during conservatorship. During conservatorship, our common shareholders do not have the ability to elect directors or to vote on other matters unless the conservator delegates this authority to them.\nNo dividends to common or preferred shareholders, other than to Treasury. Our conservator announced in September 2008 that we would not pay any dividends on the common stock or on any series of preferred stock, other than the senior preferred stock, while we are in conservatorship. In addition, under the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, dividends may not be paid to common or preferred shareholders (other than on the senior preferred stock) without the prior written consent of Treasury, regardless of whether we are in conservatorship.\nOur profits directly increase the liquidation preference of Treasury\u2019s senior preferred stock and, once they exceed our capital reserve amount, will be payable to Treasury as dividends. The senior preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock and all other series of our preferred stock, as well as any capital stock we issue in the future, as to both dividends and distributions upon liquidation. Accordingly, if we are liquidated, the senior preferred stock is entitled to its then-current liquidation preference, before any distribution is made to the holders of our common stock or other preferred stock. See \u201cBusiness-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform-Senior Preferred Stock\u201d for more information on the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock.\nExercise of the Treasury warrant would substantially dilute the investment of current shareholders. If Treasury exercises its warrant to purchase shares of our common stock equal to 79.9% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, the ownership interest in the company of our then-existing common shareholders will be substantially diluted, and we would thereafter have a controlling shareholder.\nWe are not managed for the benefit of shareholders. Because we are in conservatorship, we are not managed with a strategy to maximize shareholder returns.\nThe senior preferred stock purchase agreement, senior preferred stock and warrant can only be canceled or modified with the consent of Treasury. For additional description of the conservatorship and our agreements with Treasury, see \u201cBusiness-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform.\u201d\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 39\nRisk Factors\nThe liquidity and market value of our MBS could be adversely affected by developments in the UMBS market, including those connected with our or Freddie Mac\u2019s exit from conservatorship.\nIn 2019, we began issuing UMBS. The issuance of UMBS represented a significant change for the mortgage market and for our securitization operations and business. The success of UMBS is largely predicated on the fungibility of UMBS issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If investors stop viewing Fannie Mae-issued UMBS and Freddie Mac-issued UMBS as fungible, or if investors prefer Freddie Mac-issued UMBS over Fannie Mae-issued UMBS, it could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of Fannie Mae MBS, the volume of our UMBS issuances and our guaranty fee revenues. FHFA adopted a rule to align Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs, policies and practices that affect the prepayment rates of TBA-eligible mortgage-backed securities to support the fungibility of Fannie Mae-issued UMBS and Freddie Mac-issued UMBS. However, these alignment efforts may not be successful over the long term and the prepayment rates on Fannie Mae-issued UMBS and Freddie Mac-issued UMBS could diverge in a manner that is disadvantageous for us.\nThe continued support of FHFA, Treasury, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, and certain other regulatory bodies is critical to the success of UMBS. If any of these entities were to cease its support, the liquidity and market value of Fannie Mae-issued UMBS could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if either we or Freddie Mac exits conservatorship, it is unclear whether our and Freddie Mac\u2019s programs, policies and practices in support of UMBS and resecuritizations of each other\u2019s securities would be sustained.\nOur issuance of UMBS and structured securities backed by Freddie Mac-issued securities has increased our operational and counterparty credit risk.\nIssuing UMBS has increased our operational and counterparty credit risk exposure to Freddie Mac. When we resecuritize Freddie Mac-issued UMBS or other Freddie Mac securities, our guaranty of principal and interest extends to the underlying Freddie Mac security. We expect this risk exposure to increase as we issue more structured securities backed directly or indirectly by Freddie Mac-issued securities going forward. Although we have an indemnification agreement with Freddie Mac, in the event Freddie Mac were to fail (for credit or operational reasons) to make a payment due on its securities underlying a Fannie Mae-issued structured security, we would be obligated under our guaranty to fund any shortfall and make the entire payment on the related Fannie Mae-issued structured security on that payment date. Our pricing does not currently reflect any incremental credit, liquidity or operational risk associated with our guaranty of resecuritized Freddie Mac securities. As a result, a failure by Freddie Mac to meet its obligations under the terms of its securities that back structured securities we issue could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition, and we could be dependent on Freddie Mac and on the senior preferred stock purchase agreements that we and Freddie Mac each have with Treasury to avoid a liquidity event or a default under our guaranty.\nUMBS have created significant interdependence between the single-family mortgage securitization programs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Accordingly, the market value of single-family Fannie Mae MBS could be affected by financial and operational incidents relating to Freddie Mac, even if those incidents do not directly relate to Fannie Mae or Fannie Mae MBS. Similarly, any disruption in Freddie Mac\u2019s securitization activities or any adverse events affecting Freddie Mac\u2019s significant mortgage sellers and servicers also could adversely affect the market value of single-family Fannie Mae MBS.\nOur reliance on CSS and the common securitization platform has increased our counterparty and third-party risk.\nWe are reliant on CSS and its common securitization platform for the operation of a majority of our single-family securitization activities. In January 2020, at FHFA\u2019s direction we entered into an amended limited liability company agreement for CSS. The amendment reduced our and Freddie Mac\u2019s ability to control CSS Board decisions, even after conservatorship, including decisions about strategy, business operations and funding. The amendment expanded the CSS Board of Managers from two members designated by each GSE to include the Board Chair, CSS CEO and up to three additional FHFA-designated Board members. In January 2021, FHFA designated two additional Board members, as a result the four members designated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitute a minority of the Board and could be outvoted by non-GSE designated Board members on any matter during conservatorship and on a number of significant matters following either our or Freddie Mac\u2019s exit from conservatorship. Although the amended agreement would require our approval for certain \u201cmaterial decisions\u201d if either we or Freddie Mac have exited conservatorship, the Board may approve a number of actions even after conservatorship over the objection of the members we and Freddie Mac designate, including: approval of the annual budget and strategic plan for CSS (so long as it does not involve a material business change); withdrawal of capital by a member; and requiring capital contributions necessary to support CSS\u2019s ordinary business operations. It is possible that FHFA may require us to make additional changes to the CSS limited liability company agreement, or may otherwise impose restrictions or provisions relating to CSS or UMBS, that may adversely affect us.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 40\nRisk Factors\nWe do not currently pay service fees to CSS under our customer services agreement; its operations are funded entirely through capital contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pursuant to the limited liability company agreement. We expect this arrangement may change, but we do not know how the eventual arrangement will be structured, or what control we will have in establishing those fees. During conservatorship, FHFA can direct us to enter into an amendment of the customer services agreement or enter such an amendment on our behalf, that could provide for a fee structure that would survive an exit from conservatorship absent a further amendment to the customer services agreement, which a majority of the Board would have to approve. Although implementation of any fee changes could require a further amendment to the customer services agreement, we might not have significant leverage to negotiate that amendment and the associated fee changes given our dependence on CSS.\nOur securitization activities are complex and present significant operational and technological challenges and risks. Any measures we take to mitigate these challenges and risks might not be sufficient to prevent a disruption to our securitization activities. Our business activities could be adversely affected and the market for single-family Fannie Mae MBS could be disrupted if the common securitization platform were to fail or otherwise become unavailable to us or if CSS were unable to perform its obligations to us. Any such failure or unavailability could have a significant adverse impact on our business and could adversely affect the liquidity or market value of our single-family MBS. In addition, a failure by CSS to maintain effective controls and procedures could result in material errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate.\nWe are limited in our ability to diversify our business and may be prohibited from undertaking activities that management believes would benefit our business.\nAs a federally chartered corporation, we are subject to the limitations imposed by the Charter Act, extensive regulation, supervision and examination by FHFA and regulation by other federal agencies, including Treasury, HUD and the SEC. The Charter Act defines our permissible business activities. For example, we may not originate mortgage loans or purchase single-family loans in excess of the conforming loan limits, and our business is limited to the U.S. housing finance sector. FHFA, as our regulator, may impose additional limitations on our business. For example, the GSE Act requires us to obtain prior approval from FHFA for new products and to provide prior notice to FHFA of new activities that we consider not to be products. FHFA recently proposed a rule to implement these requirements that, if adopted, would permit FHFA to establish terms, conditions, or limitations with respect to any new product or new activity. In addition, as described in a previous risk factor, our business activities are subject to significant restrictions as a result of the conservatorship and the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. These limitations and requirements may cause us to delay or prevent us from undertaking new business activities management believes would benefit our business. Further, as a result of these limitations and requirements on our ability to diversify our operations, our financial condition and results of operations depend almost entirely on conditions in a single sector of the U.S. economy, specifically, the U.S. housing market. Weak or unstable conditions in the U.S. housing market can therefore have a significant adverse effect on our business that we cannot mitigate through diversification.\nAn active trading market in our equity securities may cease to exist, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common and preferred stock.\nOur common stock and preferred stock are now traded exclusively in the over-the-counter market, and are not currently listed on any securities exchanges. We cannot predict the actions of market makers, investors or other market participants, and can offer no assurances that the market for our securities will be stable. If there is no active trading market in our equity securities, the market price and liquidity of the securities will be adversely affected. In addition, the market price of our common stock and preferred stock is subject to significant volatility, which may be due to other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as speculation regarding our future, economic and political conditions generally, liquidity in the over-the-counter market in which our stock trades, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Such factors could cause the market price of our common stock and preferred stock to decline significantly, which may result in significant losses to holders of our common stock and preferred stock.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risk\nWe expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused substantial financial market volatility and has significantly adversely affected both the U.S. and global economies. As described in \u201cBusiness-Executive Summary-COVID-19 Impact-Economic Impact,\u201d although the economy has improved significantly since the second quarter of 2020, business activity remains below the level before the onset of the pandemic, and unemployment remains substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels. Continued high levels of new daily cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., combined with concerns about the emergence of new, more infectious variants of the coronavirus, have led to new shut-downs in various locales and reductions in business activity, with increased risk of additional public-health measures.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 41\nRisk Factors\nThe disruption caused by the pandemic differs from previous economic downturns because of the high level of uncertainty related to the health and safety of consumers and workers. We expect the path and timing of economic recovery will be impacted by the success of vaccination efforts and fiscal stimulus. We believe that sustained economic recovery depends on continued growth in consumer spending, increased business activity, and an associated reduction in unemployment, all of which impact the ability of borrowers and renters to make their monthly payments. We expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to negatively affect our financial results and our returns on capital.\nOur current forecasts and expectations relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are subject to many uncertainties and may change, perhaps substantially. It is difficult to assess or predict the impact of this unprecedented event on our business, financial results or financial condition. Factors that will impact the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our business, financial results and financial condition include: the duration, spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including government actions to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic and the widespread availability and public acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines; the extent to which consumers, workers and families feel safe resuming pre-pandemic activities; the nature, extent and success of the forbearance, payment deferrals, modifications and other loss mitigation options we provide to borrowers affected by the pandemic; accounting elections and estimates relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; borrower and renter behavior in response to the pandemic and its economic impact; how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, including whether any future outbreaks or increases in the daily number of new COVID-19 cases interrupt economic recovery; and how quickly and to what extent affected borrowers, renters and counterparties can recover from the negative economic impact of the pandemic. While we are unable to predict the future course of these events or their longer-term effects on our business, key areas we have identified where the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting or may negatively affect our business, financial results and financial condition are described below:\n\u2022Increased borrower credit risk. Among other factors, income growth and unemployment levels affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their mortgage loans. We expect the economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and elevated unemployment rates to result in continued higher serious delinquency rates and possibly in significantly higher defaults on the mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business. Because of this expectation, we had substantial credit-related expenses in 2020. As there is significant uncertainty associated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may ultimately experience greater losses than we currently expect and also may have high credit-related expenses in future periods. Moreover, we are taking a number of actions to help borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that we expect will continue to adversely affect our financial results and financial condition, including:\n\u25e6providing forbearance to single-family borrowers impacted by COVID-19-related financial hardships who request forbearance;\n\u25e6providing forbearance to eligible multifamily borrowers impacted by COVID-19-related financial hardships on the condition that such borrowers suspend evictions and other penalties relating to late rent payments during the forbearance period; and\n\u25e6temporarily suspending foreclosures and certain foreclosure-related activities for single-family properties (other than for vacant or abandoned properties).\nA number of federal, state and local authorities have implemented limitations on evictions, including the CDC eviction moratorium described in \u201cBusiness-Legislation and Regulation-U.S. Government Response to COVID-19-Relief for Individuals and Businesses; Federal Eviction Moratoriums.\u201d We believe that applicable eviction restrictions could have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the ability of some of our borrowers to make payments on their loans. We discuss the actions we have taken and their impact in more detail in \u201cMD&A-Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management\u201d and in \u201cMD&A-Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management.\u201d\nCertain states and localities have implemented COVID-19-related borrower and renter protections that are more extensive than federal or our requirements. States and localities may continue to consider such proposals in the future or extend the time period of existing protections. These additional protections, depending on their scope and whether and to what extent they apply to our business, could contribute to a higher number of single-family and multifamily borrowers becoming delinquent on their loans or could limit our ability to take enforcement actions with respect to our loans.\nIn addition, while home price appreciation was positive in 2020, the economic dislocation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in declines in home prices in the future. Similarly, economic dislocation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in declines in multifamily property valuations. Declines in multifamily property valuations would increase the amount of our loss in the event a borrower defaults on their\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 42\nRisk Factors\nloan. The magnitude of the impact would likely vary significantly across geographic regions and based on the credit characteristics of the loans.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also affect the credit quality of our new loan acquisitions. For example, CARES Act provisions prohibiting lenders from reporting previously-current borrowers receiving COVID-19-related payment accommodations as delinquent to the credit bureaus may result in our not having accurate data on a borrower\u2019s credit history when we are determining the eligibility of the single-family loans we acquire.\n\u2022Increased human capital and business resiliency risk. COVID-19 continues to spread in the U.S. and the rate of new daily cases may increase from current levels. If a significant number of our executives or other employees, or their family members for whom they provide care, contract COVID-19 during the same time period, it could materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The risk of executives, other employees or their family members contracting COVID-19 may increase with the resumption of business activity and the reopening of workplaces and schools. We are now allowing employees, on a voluntary basis, to request approval to return to work at some of our office locations. Although we have established COVID-19 safety protocols, the return of some employees to the office may increase the risk of our employees contracting COVID-19.\nWe expect a significant majority of our employees will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future, driven by safety concerns, childcare obligations and other factors. The strain on our workforce caused by this shift to a remote work environment and the uncertainty and stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may result in business interruptions, reduced productivity and other adverse impacts on our operations. While our technological systems to date have continued to function with our workforce working remotely, this telework arrangement increases the risk of technological or cybersecurity incidents that negatively affect our business operations. This telework arrangement, as well as the risk that employees or their family members could contract COVID-19 and our reliance on third parties for some functions, also could adversely affect our ability to maintain effective controls and procedures, which could result in material errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate.\n\u2022Increased counterparty credit and operational risk. The economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to default by one or more of our institutional counterparties on their obligations to us, which could result in significant financial losses.\nIn addition, if multiple single-family or multifamily servicers were to fail to meet their obligations to us, it could cause substantial disruption to our business, borrowers and the mortgage industry. We may not be able to transfer the servicing of loans to new servicers without significant operational disruptions and financial losses, and there may not be sufficient industry capacity to take on large servicing transfers.\nAs noted above, the economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to significantly higher defaults on mortgage loans. A substantially higher level of mortgage defaults could affect our mortgage insurer counterparties' ability to fully meet their payment obligations to us.\n\u2022Increased liquidity risk. As described in \u201cMD&A-Liquidity and Capital Management,\u201d while market conditions have improved since the first quarter of 2020, adverse market conditions in March limited our ability to issue debt with a maturity greater than two years. If the COVID-19 pandemic results in a sustained market liquidity crisis, our liquidity contingency plans may be difficult or impossible to execute. In this event, our alternative source of liquidity, our other investments portfolio, may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.\nIn addition, as described in \u201cMD&A-Liquidity and Capital Management,\u201d our debt funding needs increased in 2020 driven in part by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Increased market risk. Market dislocations relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have made it more challenging to manage our interest-rate risk. Furthermore, with the decline in borrower performance due to impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased uncertainty regarding the value of mortgage-related assets in the current environment, we may have higher investment losses in future periods relating to decreases in the fair value of our loans that are held for sale.\n\u2022Increased model and accounting estimate risk. Given the unprecedented nature and timing of the COVID-19 pandemic and its uncertain impact, we believe our model results relating to our allowance for loan losses currently cannot accurately capture the entirety of loan losses we will ultimately incur relating to COVID-19. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may also negatively affect our ability to rely on models to effectively manage the risks to our business. Moreover, the CARES Act provisions prohibiting lenders from reporting some borrowers receiving COVID-19-related payment accommodations as delinquent may also impact the stability of the interpretation and predictiveness of borrower credit data and therefore the reliability of our models in the future.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 43\nRisk Factors\n\u2022Increased risk of additional government action affecting our business. Federal, state and local governments have taken many actions that have or that we expect will adversely affect our financial results, such as stay-at-home orders and business shut-downs, and the loan forbearance requirements of the CARES Act. The U.S. Congress, Treasury, the Federal Reserve, FHFA or other national, state or local government agencies or legislatures may take additional steps in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that could adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition, such as expanding or extending our obligations to help borrowers, renters or counterparties affected by the pandemic or imposing new or expanded business shut-downs.\n\u2022Increased risk of mortgage fraud. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are offering certain temporary flexibilities relating to our Single-Family Selling Guide requirements. This could increase the risk of mortgage fraud relating to the loans we acquire during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the CARES Act provides that a single-family borrower may obtain mortgage payment forbearance with no additional documentation required other than the borrower's attestation to a financial hardship caused by COVID-19, which creates the risk that borrowers who are not experiencing financial hardship may request a forbearance.\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, these and the other risks discussed herein.\nCredit Risk\nWe may incur significant credit losses and credit-related expenses on the loans in our book of business.\nWe are exposed to a significant amount of mortgage credit risk on our $3.7 trillion guaranty book of business. Borrowers may fail to make required payments on mortgage loans we own or guaranty. This exposes us to the risk of credit losses and credit-related expenses.\nAs we describe earlier in this section under \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic Risk,\u201d the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed us to substantial credit-related expenses and risk of credit losses. Our serious delinquency rate increased in 2020 compared with 2019 with increased borrower participation in forbearance plans. Our loans currently in forbearance generally have a somewhat weaker credit profile than our overall guaranty book of business. If a large number of borrowers cannot repay the amounts owed at the end of their forbearance plans or over time, or fail to qualify for repayment plans, payment deferrals or modifications, this could result in significantly higher defaults on the mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to result in a continued higher serious delinquency rate over the next several quarters compared to pre-pandemic levels in recent periods exposing us to greater credit risk.\nThe credit performance of loans in our book of business could deteriorate further, particularly if we experience home price declines, continued economic dislocation and elevated unemployment, resulting in significantly higher credit losses and credit-related expenses. Although we strengthened our underwriting and eligibility standards over the last decade, we continue to have loans in our book of business that were originated prior to the financial market crisis of 2008, and these loans continue to generate a disproportionate percentage of our credit losses. We present detailed information about the risk characteristics of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business in \u201cMD&A-Single-Family Business\u201d and our multifamily guaranty book of business in \u201cMD&A-Multifamily Business.\u201d\nWhile we use certain credit enhancements to mitigate some of our potential future credit losses, we may not be able to obtain as much protection from our credit enhancements as we would like, for a number of reasons:\n\u2022Some of the credit enhancements we use, such as mortgage insurance, credit insurance risk transfer transactions and DUS lender loss-sharing arrangements, are subject to the risk that the counterparties may not meet their obligations to us.\n\u2022Our credit risk transfer transactions have limited terms, after which they provide limited or no further credit protection on the covered loans.\n\u2022Generally, our credit risk transfer transactions do not cover losses from principal forgiveness.\n\u2022Our credit risk transfer transactions are not designed to shield us from all losses because we retain a portion of the risk of future losses on loans covered by these transactions, including all or a portion of the first loss risk in most transactions.\n\u2022In the event of a sufficiently severe economic downturn, we may not be able to enter into new back-end credit risk transfer transactions for our recent acquisitions on economically advantageous terms.\n\u2022Mortgage insurance does not protect us from all losses on covered loans. For example, mortgage insurance does not cover property damage that is not already covered by the hazard or flood insurance we require, and such damage may result in a reduction to, or a denial of mortgage insurance benefits. A property damaged by a flood that was outside a Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d)-designated Special Flood Hazard\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 44\nRisk Factors\nArea, where we require coverage, or a property damaged by an earthquake are the most likely scenarios where property damage may result in a default not covered by hazard insurance.\nFor the last several years we have used credit risk transfer transactions as an important tool to manage the credit risk of our loan acquisitions. We did not enter into new credit risk transfer transactions in the second quarter of 2020 due to adverse market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Market conditions improved in the second half of 2020, but we have not entered into any new transactions. As a result, the portion of our single-family book covered by credit enhancement decreased from 53% in 2019 to 42% as of December 31, 2020. We continue to evaluate the costs and benefits of credit risk transfer transactions, including a reduction in capital relief these transactions provide under FHFA\u2019s enterprise regulatory capital framework. We may engage in credit risk transfer transactions in the future, which could help us manage capital and manage within our risk appetite, particularly given the growth and turnover in our book in 2020. The structure of and extent to which we engage in any additional credit risk transfer transactions will be affected by the enterprise regulatory capital framework, our risk appetite, the strength of future market conditions, including the cost of these transactions, and the review of our overall business and capital plan.\nOne or more of our institutional counterparties may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, resulting in financial losses, business disruption and decreased ability to manage risk.\nWe rely on our institutional counterparties to provide services and credit enhancements that are critical to our business. We face the risk that one or more of our institutional counterparties may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. If an institutional counterparty defaults on its obligations to us, it could also negatively impact our ability to operate our business, as we outsource some of our critical functions to third parties, such as mortgage servicing, single-family Fannie Mae MBS issuance and administration, and certain technology functions.\nOur primary exposures to institutional counterparty risk are with credit guarantors that provide credit enhancements on the mortgage assets that we hold in our retained mortgage portfolio or that back our Fannie Mae MBS, including;\n\u2022mortgage insurers and reinsurers, including those that participate in our Credit Insurance Risk TransferTM (\u201cCIRTTM\u201d) transactions, and multifamily lenders with risk sharing arrangements;\n\u2022mortgage servicers that service the loans we hold in our retained mortgage portfolio or that back our Fannie Mae MBS;\n\u2022mortgage sellers and servicers that are obligated to repurchase loans from us or reimburse us for losses in certain circumstances;\n\u2022the financial institutions that issue the investments, including overnight bank deposits, held in our other investments portfolio; and\n\u2022derivatives counterparties.\nWe also have counterparty exposure to custodial depository institutions; mortgage originators, investors and dealers; debt security dealers; central counterparty clearing institutions; and document custodians.\nThe concentration of our counterparties in similar or related businesses heightens our counterparty risk exposure. We routinely enter into a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, mortgage lenders and commercial banks, and mortgage insurers, resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to this industry. We may also have multiple exposures to particular counterparties, as many of our counterparties perform several types of services for us. For example, our lender customers or their affiliates may also act as derivatives counterparties, mortgage servicers, custodial depository institutions or document custodians. Accordingly, if one of these counterparties were to become insolvent or otherwise default on its obligations to us, it could harm our business and financial results in a variety of ways.\nAn institutional counterparty may default on its obligations to us for a number of reasons, such as changes in financial condition that affect its credit rating, changes in its servicer rating, a reduction in liquidity, operational failures or insolvency. The economic dislocation from the COVID-19 pandemic increases the risk that these conditions may arise. In the event of a bankruptcy or receivership of one of our counterparties, we may be required to establish our ownership rights to the assets these counterparties hold on our behalf to the satisfaction of the bankruptcy court or receiver, which could result in a delay in accessing these assets causing a decline in their value. Counterparty defaults or limitations on their ability to do business with us could result in significant financial losses or hamper our ability to do business or manage the risks to our business. In addition, if we are unable to replace a defaulting counterparty that performs services critical to our business, it could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations and manage risk.\nWe have significant exposure to institutions in the financial services industry relating to derivatives, funding, short-term lending, securities, and other transactions. We depend on our ability to enter into derivatives transactions with our derivatives counterparties in order to manage the duration and prepayment risk of our retained mortgage portfolio. If we lose access to our derivatives counterparties, it could adversely affect our ability to manage these risks.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 45\nRisk Factors\nWe use clearinghouses to facilitate many of our derivative trades. If the clearinghouse or the clearing member we use to access the clearinghouse defaults, we could lose margin that we have posted with the clearing member or clearinghouse. We are also a clearing member of two divisions of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (\u201cFICC\u201d), a central counterparty (\u201cCCP\u201d). One FICC division clears our trades involving securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other non-mortgage related securities. The other division clears our forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-related securities, including dollar roll transactions. As a clearing member of FICC, we could be exposed to the losses if the CCP or one or more of the CCP\u2019s clearing members fails to perform its obligations, because each FICC clearing member is required to absorb a portion of the losses incurred by other clearing members if they fail to meet their obligations to the clearinghouse. For more information, see \u201cMD&A-Risk Management-Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management-Other Counterparties-Central Counterparty Clearing Institutions.\u201d\nOur financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected if mortgage servicers fail to perform their obligations to us.\nWe delegate the servicing of the mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business to mortgage servicers; we do not have our own servicing function. Functions performed by mortgage servicers on our behalf include collecting and delivering principal and interest payments, administering escrow accounts, monitoring and reporting delinquencies, performing default prevention activities and other functions. The inability of a mortgage servicer to perform these functions could negatively impact our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022manage our book of business;\n\u2022collect amounts due to us;\n\u2022actively manage troubled loans; and\n\u2022implement our homeownership assistance, foreclosure prevention and other loss mitigation efforts.\nA large portion of our single-family guaranty book is serviced by non-depository servicers. The potentially lower financial strength, liquidity and operational capacity of non-depository mortgage sellers and servicers compared with depository mortgage sellers and servicers may negatively affect their ability to fully satisfy their financial obligations or to properly service the loans on our behalf.\nIf we replace a mortgage servicer, we likely would incur costs and potential increases in servicing fees and could also face operational risks. If a mortgage servicer fails, it could result in a temporary disruption in servicing and loss mitigation activities relating to the loans serviced by that mortgage servicer, particularly if there is a loss of experienced servicing personnel. We may also face challenges in transferring a large servicing portfolio.\nMultifamily mortgage servicing is typically performed by the lenders who sell the mortgages to us. We are exposed to the risk that multifamily servicers could come under financial pressure, which could potentially result in a decline in the quality of the servicing they provide us.\nFor the majority of the loans in our single-family guaranty book of business and nearly all of the loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business, we require servicers to advance missed borrower principal and interest payments for up to four months. Single-family servicers are also required to advance property tax and insurance payments to taxing authorities, hazard insurers and mortgage insurers. If a large number of single-family or multifamily borrowers do not pay their mortgages as a result of the economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our servicers may not have sufficient liquidity to advance these missed payments. In such case, we would be required to make the payments, which could require us to obtain substantial additional funding. The actions we have taken to mitigate our credit risk exposure to mortgage servicers may not be sufficient to prevent us from experiencing significant financial losses or business interruptions in the event they cannot fulfill their obligations to us.\nWe may incur losses as a result of claims under our mortgage insurance policies not being paid in full or at all.\nWe rely heavily on mortgage insurers to provide insurance against borrower defaults on single-family conventional mortgage loans with LTV ratios over 80% at the time of acquisition. Although the financial condition of our primary mortgage insurer counterparties currently approved to write new business has improved in recent years and they must meet risk-based asset requirements, there is still a risk that these counterparties may fail to fulfill their obligations to pay our claims under insurance policies.\nWith respect to primary mortgage insurers that we have approved to write coverage on loans sold to us, we currently do not differentiate pricing based on counterparty strength or operational performance. Additionally, we would not revoke a primary mortgage insurer\u2019s status as an eligible insurer unless there was a material violation of our private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements. Further, we do not generally select the provider of primary mortgage insurance on a specific loan, because the selection is usually made by the lender at the time the loan is originated. Accordingly, we have limited ability to manage our concentration risk with respect to primary mortgage insurers.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 46\nRisk Factors\nThree of our mortgage insurer counterparties that are currently not approved to write new business-PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. (\u201cPMI\u201d), Triad Guaranty Insurance Corporation (\u201cTriad\u201d) and Republic Mortgage Insurance Company (\u201cRMIC\u201d)-are currently in run-off. Mortgage insurers that are in run-off continue to collect renewal premiums and process claims on their existing insurance business, but are no longer approved to write new insurance with us, which increases the risk that the mortgage insurer will fail to pay claims fully. Entering run-off may limit sources of profits and liquidity for the mortgage insurer and could also cause the quality and speed of its claims processing to deteriorate. PMI and Triad have been paying only a portion of policyholder claims and deferring the remaining portion and it is uncertain whether they will be permitted in the future to pay their deferred policyholder claims or increase or decrease the amount of cash they pay on claims. RMIC is no longer deferring payments on policyholder claims, but remains in run-off. For more information on mortgage insurers in run-off and our risk in force mortgage insurance coverage see \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Concentrations of Credit Risk-Other Concentrations.\u201d\nOn at least a quarterly basis, we assess our mortgage insurer counterparties\u2019 respective abilities to fulfill their obligations to us, and our loss reserves take into account this assessment. If our assessment indicates their ability to pay claims has deteriorated significantly or if our projected claim amounts have increased, we could experience an increase credit-related expenses and credit losses.\nMortgage fraud could result in significant financial losses and harm to our reputation.\nWe use a process of delegated underwriting in which lenders make specific representations and warranties about the characteristics of the mortgage loans we purchase and securitize. As a result, we do not independently verify most borrower information that is provided to us. This exposes us to the risk that one or more of the parties involved in a transaction (the borrower, seller, broker, appraiser, title agent, lender or servicer) will engage in fraud by misrepresenting facts about a mortgage loan. Similarly, we rely on delegated servicing of loans and use of a variety of external resources to manage our REO inventory. We have experienced financial losses resulting from mortgage fraud, including institutional fraud perpetrated by counterparties. In the future, we may experience additional financial losses or reputational damage as a result of mortgage fraud.\nWe may suffer losses if borrowers are unable to obtain property or flood insurance, if their claims under insurance policies are not paid, or if they suffer property damage as a result of a hazard for which we do not require insurance, such as flooding outside of certain areas.\nIn general, we require borrowers to obtain property insurance to cover the risk of damage to their homes resulting from hazards such as fire, wind and, for properties in a Special Flood Hazard Area as designated by FEMA, flooding. As of December 31, 2020, 3.4% of loans in our single-family guaranty book of business and 6.9% of loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business are located in a Special Flood Hazard Area. For flood insurance, single-family borrowers generally rely on the National Flood Insurance Program (\u201cNFIP\u201d), which was recently extended through September 2021. If Congress fails to extend or re-authorize the program upon future expirations, FEMA may not have sufficient funds to pay claims for flood damage, and borrowers may not be able to renew their flood insurance coverage or obtain new policies through the NFIP. In addition, NFIP insurance does not cover temporary living expenses, and the maximum limit of coverage available under NFIP for a single-family residential property is $250,000, which may not be sufficient to cover all losses.\nThe risk of significant flooding in places outside of a Special Flood Hazard Area (that is, in places where we do not require flood insurance) is expected to increase in the coming years as a result of climate change. Increases in the intensity or frequency of floods or other weather-related disasters as a result of climate change will intensify the foregoing risks. To the extent that borrowers are unable to obtain property or flood insurance and suffer property damage, their claims under insurance policies are not paid, or they suffer property damage as a result of a hazard for which we do not generally require insurance, such as earthquake damage or flood damage on a property located outside a Special Flood Hazard Area, they may not pay their mortgage loans, which negatively impacts our credit losses and credit-related expenses.\nIn addition, insurers may become less willing to continue writing coverage in certain areas for certain perils, which may depress home prices in those areas and may limit the loans that Fannie Mae is able to acquire in those areas. Ultimately, the desirability of areas that frequently experience hurricanes, wildfires or other natural disasters may diminish over time, which can depress home prices or adversely affect the region\u2019s economy, which may negatively impact our financial results.\nThe occurrence of major natural or other disasters in the United States or its territories and the impact of climate change could negatively impact our credit losses and credit-related expenses.\nWe conduct our business in the single-family and multifamily residential mortgage markets and own or guarantee the performance of mortgage loans throughout the United States and its territories. The occurrence of a major natural or environmental disaster, terrorist attack, cyber attack, pandemic, or similar event (a \u201cmajor disruptive event\u201d) in the\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 47\nRisk Factors\nUnited States or its territories could negatively impact our credit losses and credit-related expenses in the affected geographic area or, depending on the magnitude, scope and nature of the event, nationally, in a number of ways. As we describe earlier in this section under \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic Risk,\u201d the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed us to substantial credit-related expenses and risk of credit losses. A major disruptive event that either damages or destroys residential or multifamily real estate securing mortgage loans in our book of business or negatively impacts the ability of borrowers to make principal and interest payments on mortgage loans in our book of business could increase our delinquency rates, default rates and average loan loss severity of our book of business in the affected region or regions. Further, a major disruptive event or a long-lasting increase in the vulnerability of an area to disasters that affects borrowers\u2019 ability make payments on their mortgages, discourages housing activity, including homebuilding or home buying, or causes a deterioration in housing conditions in the affected region could lower the volume of originations in the mortgage market, influence home prices and property values in the affected region or in adjacent regions and increase delinquency rates and default rates. Any of these outcomes could generate significant credit losses and credit-related expenses.\nRecent years have seen frequent and severe natural disasters in the U.S., including hurricanes, wildfires and floods. The frequency and intensity of major weather-related events is indicative of the impact of climate change and this change is expected to persist for the foreseeable future. Population growth and an increase in people living in high-risk areas, such as coastal areas vulnerable to severe storms and flooding, have also increased the impact of these events. Although our financial exposure from these events is mitigated to the extent our book of business is geographically diverse, we remain exposed to risk, particularly in connection with the risk of geographically widespread weather events and changes in weather patterns. In addition, the increasing unpredictability of major natural disasters negatively affects our ability to forecast losses from such events, which may negatively impact our ability to accurately address the likelihood of such losses in the guaranty fees that we charge. As a result, any continuation or increase in recent weather trends or their unpredictability, or any single natural disaster of significant scope or intensity, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, legal or regulatory responses to concerns about global climate change may impact the housing markets and, as a result, our business. Steps to address the risk of more frequent or severe weather events resulting from climate change could result in a potentially disruptive transition away from carbon-intense industries. Such a transition could negatively impact certain industries and regional economies, affecting the ability of borrowers in those industries or regions to pay their mortgage loans. President Biden has indicated that addressing climate change will be a priority for his administration.\nOperational Risk\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could materially adversely affect our business, impair our liquidity, cause financial losses and harm our reputation.\nShortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people, data management or systems could disrupt our business or have a material adverse effect on our risk management, liquidity, financial statement reliability, financial condition and results of operations. Such a failure could result in legislative or regulatory intervention or sanctions, liability to customers, financial losses, business disruptions and damage to our reputation. For example, our business is highly dependent on our ability to manage and process, on a daily basis, an extremely large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets that continuously and rapidly change and evolve. These transactions are subject to various legal, accounting and regulatory standards. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or manage associated data with reliability and integrity. In addition, we rely on information provided by third parties in processing many of our transactions; that information may be incorrect or we may fail to properly manage or analyze it or properly monitor its data quality.\nWe rely upon business processes that are highly dependent on people, technology and equipment, data and the use of numerous complex systems and models to manage our business and produce books and records upon which our financial statements and risk reporting are prepared. This reliance increases the risk that we may be exposed to financial, reputational or other losses as a result of inadequately designed internal processes or data management architecture, inflexible technology or the failure of our systems. While we continue to enhance our technology, infrastructure, operational controls and organizational structure in order to reduce our operational risk, these actions may not be effective to manage these risks and may create additional operational risk as we execute these enhancements. In addition, our use of third-party service providers for some of our business and technology functions increases the risk that an operational failure by a third party will adversely affect us.\nOur ability to manage and aggregate data may be limited by the effectiveness of our policies, programs, processes, systems and practices that govern how data is acquired, validated, stored, protected, processed and shared. Failure to\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 48\nRisk Factors\nmanage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risks, as well as to manage changing business needs.\nWe also face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, paying agents, exchanges, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries, including CSS and Freddie Mac, we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions. In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses. This consolidation and interconnectivity increases the risk of operational failure, on both an individual basis and an industry-wide basis, as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions or manage our exposure to risk.\nSubstantially all of our employees and business operations functions are consolidated in two metropolitan areas: Washington, DC and Dallas, Texas. As a result of this concentration of our employees and facilities, a major disruptive event at either location could impact our ability to operate notwithstanding the business continuity plans and facilities that we have in place, including our out-of-region data center for disaster recovery. Moreover, because of the concentration of our employees in the Washington, DC and Dallas metropolitan areas, a regional disruption in one of these areas could prevent our employees from occupying our facilities, working remotely, or communicating with or traveling to other locations. Further, if the frequency, severity or unpredictability of weather-related events in the Washington, DC or Dallas regions increases as a result of changing weather patterns, then these disruptions could occur regularly or last for longer periods of time. Accordingly, the occurrence of one or more major disruptive events could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and lead to financial losses.\nA breach of the security of our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could damage or disrupt our business or result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential information, which could damage our reputation, result in regulatory sanctions and/or increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur operations rely on the secure receipt, processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and with our business partners, including proprietary, confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy laws, regulations or contractual obligations. Information security risks for large institutions like us have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct or automate financial transactions. A number of financial services companies, consumer-based companies and other organizations have reported the unauthorized disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information, as well as cyber attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information, intellectual property, cash or other valuable assets. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested \u201cransom\u201d payments in exchange for not disclosing stolen customer information or for not disabling the target company\u2019s computer or other systems.\nWe have been, and likely will continue to be, the target of cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks and other information security threats. To date, cyber attacks have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results or business; however, we could suffer material financial or other losses in the future and we are not able to predict the severity of these attacks. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things:\n\u2022the evolving nature of these threats;\n\u2022the current global economic and political environment;\n\u2022our prominent size and scale and our role in the financial services industry;\n\u2022the outsourcing of some of our business operations;\n\u2022the ongoing shortage of qualified cybersecurity professionals;\n\u2022our migration to cloud-based systems;\n\u2022our increased use of employee-owned devices for business communication;\n\u2022the large number of our employees working remotely; and\n\u2022the interconnectivity and interdependence of third parties to our systems.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our software, computers, systems and information, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems and assets, or to implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, especially because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently, are complex, and are often not recognized until launched. We routinely identify cyber threats as well as vulnerabilities in our systems and work to address them, but these efforts may be insufficient. Further, these efforts involve costs that can be significant as cyber attack methods continue to rapidly evolve. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources,\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 49\nRisk Factors\nincluding external parties who are affiliated with foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third parties may also attempt to induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our systems or network, or to our data or that of our counterparties or borrowers, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent.\nThe occurrence of a cyber attack, breach, unauthorized access, misuse, computer virus or other malicious code or other cybersecurity event could jeopardize or result in the unauthorized disclosure, gathering, monitoring, misuse, corruption, loss or destruction of confidential and other information that belongs to us, our customers, our counterparties, third-party service providers or borrowers that is processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks. The occurrence of such an event could also result in damage to our software, computers or systems, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our customers\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations. This could result in significant financial losses, loss of customers and business opportunities, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCyber attacks can occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. Investigations of cyber attacks are inherently unpredictable, and it takes time to complete an investigation and have full and reliable information. While we are investigating a cyber attack, we do not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and we can repeat or compound certain errors or actions before we discover and remediate them. In addition, announcing that a cyber attack has occurred increases the risk of additional cyber attacks, and preparing for this elevated risk can delay the announcement of a cyber attack. All or any of these challenges could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\nIn addition, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. Although we maintain insurance coverage relating to cybersecurity risks, our insurance may not be sufficient to provide adequate loss coverage in all circumstances.\nBecause we are interconnected with and dependent on third-party vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, fiscal and paying agents, and other financial intermediaries, including CSS, we could be materially adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event. Third parties with which we do business may also be sources of cybersecurity or other technological risks. We outsource certain functions and these relationships allow for the external storage and processing of our information, as well as customer, counterparty and borrower information, including on cloud-based systems. We also share this type of information with regulatory agencies and their vendors. While we engage in actions to mitigate our exposure resulting from our information-sharing activities, ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data or other cybersecurity incidents with increased costs and consequences to us such as those described above.\nWe routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means. In addition, our customers maintain personal, confidential and proprietary information on systems we provide. We have discussed and worked with customers, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer, vendor, service provider, counterparty or other third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.\nOur concurrent implementation of multiple new initiatives may increase our operational risk and result in one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are currently implementing a number of initiatives in furtherance of both our and our conservator\u2019s strategic objectives. The magnitude of the many new initiatives we are undertaking may increase our operational risk. Many of these initiatives involve significant changes to our business processes, systems and infrastructure, and present significant operational challenges for us. Some business initiatives that we are currently developing or executing against include a new hedge accounting program, our environmental, social and governance initiatives, enhancements and efficiencies to our operational processes, and enhancements to our existing and development of new information technology and other systems. For example, for the past several years we have been transitioning our core information technology systems to third-party cloud-based platforms. If completing this initiative is delayed or we fail to complete it in a well-managed, secure and effective manner, we may experience unplanned service disruption or unforeseen costs, which could result in material harm to our business and results of operations. While implementation of each individual initiative creates operational challenges, implementing multiple initiatives during the same time period significantly increases these challenges. Due to the operational complexity associated with these changes and the limited time\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 50\nRisk Factors\nperiods for implementing them, we believe there is a risk that implementing these changes could result in one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in a future period. If this were to occur, we could experience material errors in our reported financial results. In addition, FHFA, Treasury, other agencies of the U.S. government or Congress may require us to implement additional initiatives in the future that could further increase our operational risk.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate.\nManagement has determined that, as of the date of this filing, we have ineffective disclosure controls and procedures that result in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has expressed an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting because of the material weakness. Our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weakness could result in errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur material weakness relates specifically to the impact of the conservatorship on our disclosure controls and procedures. Because we are under the control of FHFA, some of the information that we may need to meet our disclosure obligations may be solely within the knowledge of FHFA. As our conservator, FHFA has the power to take actions without our knowledge that could be material to our shareholders and other stakeholders, and could significantly affect our financial performance or our continued existence as an ongoing business. Because FHFA currently functions as both our regulator and our conservator, there are inherent structural limitations on our ability to design, implement, test or operate effective disclosure controls and procedures relating to information known to FHFA. As a result, we have not been able to update our disclosure controls and procedures in a manner that adequately ensures the accumulation and communication to management of information known to FHFA that is needed to meet our disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws, including disclosures affecting our financial statements. Given the structural nature of this material weakness, we do not expect to remediate this weakness while we are under conservatorship. See \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d for further discussion of management\u2019s conclusions on our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nFailure of our models to produce reliable results may adversely affect our ability to manage risk and make effective business decisions.\nWe make significant use of quantitative models to measure and monitor our risk exposures and to manage our business. For example, we use models to measure and monitor our exposures to interest rate, credit and market risks, and to forecast credit losses. We use this information in making business decisions relating to strategies, initiatives, transactions, pricing and products.\nModels are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on historical data and assumptions regarding factors such as future loan demand, borrower behavior, creditworthiness and home price trends. Other potential sources of inaccurate or inappropriate model results include errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model\u2019s design. Modeling often assumes that historical data or experience can be relied upon as a basis for forecasting future events, an assumption that may be especially tenuous in the face of unprecedented events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGiven the challenges of predicting future behavior, management judgment is used at every stage of the modeling process, from model design decisions regarding core underlying assumptions, to interpreting and applying final model output. To control for these inherent imperfections, our models are validated by an independent model risk management team within our Enterprise Risk Management Division and are subject to control requirements set by our model risk policies.\nWhen market conditions change quickly and in unforeseen ways, there is an increased risk that the model assumptions and data inputs for our models are not representative of the most recent market conditions, which requires management judgment to make adjustments or overrides to our models. In a rapidly changing environment, it may not be possible to update existing models quickly enough to properly account for the most recently available data and events. For example, the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected our ability to rely on models and may continue to do so.\nIf our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management decisions, including decisions affecting loan purchases, management of credit losses, guaranty fee pricing, and asset and liability management. Moreover, strategies we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 51\nRisk Factors\nLiquidity and Funding Risk\nLimitations on our ability to access the debt capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations, and our liquidity contingency plans may be difficult or impossible to execute during a sustained liquidity crisis.\nOur ability to fund our business depends on our ongoing access to the debt capital markets. Market concerns about matters such as the extent of government support for our business and debt securities, the future of our business (including future profitability, future structure, regulatory actions and our status as a government-sponsored enterprise) and the creditworthiness of the U.S. government could cause a severe negative effect on our access to the unsecured debt markets, particularly for long-term debt. We believe that our ability in recent years to issue debt of varying maturities at attractive pricing resulted from federal government support of our business. As a result, we believe that our status as a government-sponsored enterprise and continued federal government support is essential to maintaining our access to debt funding. Changes or perceived changes in federal government support of our business, our debt securities or our status as a government-sponsored enterprise, including changes arising in connection with efforts to end our conservatorship, could materially and adversely affect our ability to fund our business. There can be no assurance that the government will continue to support our business or our debt securities, or that our current level of access to debt funding will continue. If our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury is amended in the future to reduce its support for our debt securities issued after such amendment, it could materially increase our borrowing costs or materially adversely affect our access to the debt capital markets.\nFuture changes or disruptions in the financial markets could significantly change the amount, mix and cost of funds we obtain, as well as our liquidity position. If we are unable to issue both short- and long-term debt securities at attractive rates and in amounts sufficient to operate our business and meet our obligations, it likely would interfere with the operation of our business and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and net worth.\nOur liquidity contingency plans may be difficult or impossible to execute during a sustained market liquidity crisis. If the financial markets experience substantial volatility in the future similar to or more intensely than in 2020, it could significantly adversely affect the amount, mix and cost of funds we obtain, as well as our liquidity position. If we cannot access the unsecured debt markets, our ability to repay maturing indebtedness and fund our operations could be eliminated or significantly impaired. In this event, our alternative source of liquidity, our other investments portfolio, may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.\nA decrease in the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt could have an adverse effect on our ability to issue debt on reasonable terms, particularly if such a decrease were not based on a similar action on the credit ratings of the U.S. government. A decrease in our credit ratings also could require that we post additional collateral for our derivatives contracts.\nA reduction in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to conduct our normal business operations, our financial condition and our results of operations. Credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt, as well as the credit ratings of the U.S. government, are primary factors that could affect our borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets. Credit ratings on our debt are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies. Actions by governmental entities impacting the support our business or our debt securities receive from Treasury could adversely affect the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt. If our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury is amended to reduce its support for our debt securities issued after such amendment, it could result in a downgrade in the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt.\nBecause we rely on the U.S. government for capital support, in recent years, when a rating agency has taken an action relating to the U.S. government\u2019s credit rating, they have taken a similar action relating to our ratings at approximately the same time. S&P, Moody\u2019s and Fitch have all indicated that they would likely lower their ratings on the debt of Fannie Mae and certain other government-related entities if they were to lower their ratings on the U.S. government. As a result, if a future government shutdown or other event results in downgrades of the government\u2019s credit rating, our credit ratings may be similarly downgraded. We currently cannot predict the potential impact of a credit ratings downgrade on demand for our securities or on our business.\nA reduction in our credit ratings also could cause derivatives clearing organizations or their members to demand that we post additional collateral for our derivative contracts. Our credit ratings and ratings outlook are included in \u201cMD&A-Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Credit Ratings.\u201d\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 52\nRisk Factors\nMarket and Industry Risk\nChanges in interest rates or our loss of the ability to manage interest-rate risk successfully could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and increase interest-rate risk.\nWe are subject to interest-rate risk, which is the risk that movements in interest rates will adversely affect the value of our assets or liabilities or our future earnings. The primary source of our interest-rate risk is our retained mortgage portfolio, other investments portfolio and the Fannie Mae debt and risk management derivatives we use to fund and manage these portfolios. We describe these risks in more detail in \u201cMD&A-Risk Management-Market Risk Management, Including Interest-Rate Risk Management.\u201d Changes in interest rates affect both the value of our mortgage assets and prepayment rates on our mortgage loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition, as well as our liquidity.\nOur ability to manage interest-rate risk depends on our ability to issue debt instruments with a range of maturities and other features, including call provisions, at attractive rates and to engage in derivatives transactions. We must exercise judgment in selecting the amount, type and mix of debt and derivative instruments that will most effectively manage our interest-rate risk. The amount, type and mix of financial instruments that are available to us may not offset possible future changes in the spread between our borrowing costs and the interest we earn on our mortgage assets.\nWe mark to market changes in the estimated fair value of our derivatives through our earnings on a quarterly basis, but we do not similarly mark to market changes in some of the financial instruments that generate our interest-rate risk exposures. As a result, changes in interest rates, particularly significant changes, can have a significant adverse effect on our earnings and net worth for the quarter in which the changes occur, depending on the nature of the changes and the derivatives and short-term investments we hold at that time. For example, we invest the cash held in MBS trusts in short-term investments, such as reverse repo arrangements and U.S. Treasury bills, or hold it in our Federal Reserve account. In a positive interest-rate environment we are entitled to the interest income earned on these short-term investments. If interest rates on short-term investments become negative we would plan to keep all trust cash in our Federal Reserve account. The Federal Reserve has previously indicated that it is not considering adopting a negative interest rate policy and negative interest rates on short-term products have been limited; however, if negative interest rates become more prevalent in the market and the Federal Reserve adopts a negative interest rate policy, then the cash we hold in MBS trusts may not be sufficient to make required payments of principal and interest. If this were to occur, we would be required to replace any shortfall with our own funds to make payments that are due to Fannie Mae MBS certificateholders.\nThe overall decline in interest rates in 2020 resulted in declines in the fair value of some of the financial instruments that we mark to market through our earnings, which contributed to our fair value losses in 2020. While we have not generally experienced negative interest rates in the United States, some central banks in Europe and Asia have in the past cut interest rates below zero. If U.S. interest rates decline further or fall below zero, it could also further negatively affect our ability to manage our interest-rate risk and result in additional fair value losses, and negative interest rates could increase our operational risk. Additionally a low or negative interest rate environment could reduce the amounts that we earn on our other investment portfolio to the extent interest rates on our investments are lower than the interest expense associated with the debt that funds those assets and we are unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments. The lower interest rates in 2020 also contributed to an increase in the size of our retained mortgage portfolio due to an increase in our acquisitions of loans through our whole loan conduit. We expect the size of our retained mortgage portfolio will continue to increase, driven by increases in the amount of loans we purchase from MBS trusts as a result of loan delinquencies and loss mitigation strategies. Because we expect our retained mortgage portfolio to grow, we have increased our outstanding debt and derivative issuance activity. This has increased the risk that movements in interest rates will affect our financial results.\nWhile we implemented hedge accounting in 2021 to reduce the impact of interest-rate volatility on our financial results, we have experienced significant fair value losses in some periods due to changes in interest rates, and we expect to continue to experience volatility from period to period in our financial results as a result of fair value losses or gains on our derivatives.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect our credit losses. When interest rates increase, our credit losses from loans with adjustable payment terms may increase as borrower payments increase at their reset dates, which increases the borrower\u2019s risk of default. Rising interest rates may also reduce the opportunity for these borrowers to refinance into a fixed-rate loan. Similarly, many borrowers may have additional debt obligations, such as home equity lines of credit and second liens, that also have adjustable payment terms. If a borrower\u2019s payment on his or her other debt obligations increases due to rising interest rates or a change in amortization, it increases the risk that the borrower may default on a loan we own or guarantee. In addition to increasing the risk of future borrower defaults, rising interest rates reduce expected future loan prepayments, which lengthens the expected life of our loans and therefore increases our impairment related to any concessions we may have provided on those loans.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 53\nRisk Factors\nChanges in spreads could materially impact our results of operations, net worth and the fair value of our net assets.\nSpread risk can result from changes in the spread between our mortgage assets and the debt and derivatives we use to hedge our position, as well as the current market spreads of our Connecticut Avenue Securities\u00ae (\u201cCAS\u201d) deals issued prior to 2016 that are subject to fair value accounting. Changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, liquidity, prepayment and default expectations, and the level of uncertainty in the market for a particular asset class may cause fluctuations in spreads. Changes in mortgage spreads have contributed to significant volatility in our financial results in certain periods, due to fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the financial instruments that we mark to market through our earnings, and this could occur again in a future period. Changes in mortgage spreads could cause significant fair value losses, and could adversely affect our near-term financial results and net worth. We do not actively manage or hedge our spread risk after we purchase mortgage assets, other than through asset monitoring and disposition.\nUncertainty relating to the potential discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nWe routinely engage in transactions involving financial instruments that reference LIBOR, including loans, securities, and derivative transactions. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling the group of major banks that sustain LIBOR to submit rate quotations after 2021. In November 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, stated its intention to cease publication of one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR after 2021, and to cease publication of overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and one-year U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors after June 2023. We have exposure to one-month, three-month, six-month and one-year LIBOR, including in financial instruments that mature after June 2023.\nEfforts are underway to identify and transition to a set of alternative reference rates. As described in \u201cBusiness-Legislation and Regulation-GSE Act and Other Legislative and Regulatory Matters-The Future of LIBOR and Alternative Reference Rates,\u201d the ARRC has recommended an alternative reference rate referred to as SOFR. However, SOFR is calculated based on different criteria than LIBOR. Accordingly, SOFR and LIBOR may diverge, particularly in times of macroeconomic stress. Since the initial publication of SOFR in 2018, daily changes in SOFR have at times been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or market rates, and SOFR may be subject to direct influence by activities of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in ways that other rates may not be. For example, at the direction of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York conducted overnight and term repurchase agreement (\u201crepo\u201d) operations to help maintain the federal funds rate within a target range starting in September 2019. Those activities lasted for an extended period of months and directly impacted prevailing SOFR rates.\nWhile many of our LIBOR-indexed financial instruments allow us to take discretionary action to select an alternative reference rate if LIBOR is discontinued, our use of an alternative reference rate may be subject to legal challenges. There is considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of LIBOR in financial instruments. This uncertainty could result in disputes and litigation with counterparties and borrowers surrounding the implementation of alternative reference rates in our financial instruments that reference LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases or changes in a manner that causes regulators or market participants to question its viability, financial instruments indexed to LIBOR could experience disparate outcomes based on their contractual terms, ability to amend those terms, market or product type, legal or regulatory jurisdiction, and other factors. There can be no assurance that legislative or regulatory actions will dictate what happens if LIBOR ceases or is no longer representative or viable, or what those actions might be. In addition, while the ARRC was created to ensure a successful transition from LIBOR, there can be no assurance that the ARRC will endorse practices that create a smooth transition and minimize value transfers between market participants, or that its endorsed practices will be broadly adopted by market participants. Divergent industry or market participant actions could result after LIBOR is no longer available, representative, or viable. It is uncertain what effect any divergent industry practices will have on the performance of financial instruments, including those that we own or have issued. Alternative reference rates that replace LIBOR may not yield the same or similar economic results over the lives of the financial instruments, which could adversely affect the value of and return on these instruments. The LIBOR transition could result in our paying higher interest rates on our current LIBOR-indexed obligations, adversely affect the yield on and fair value of the loans and securities we hold or guarantee that reference LIBOR, and increase the costs of or affect our ability to effectively use derivative instruments to manage interest-rate risk.\nThese developments could have a material impact on us, adjustable-rate mortgage borrowers, investors, and our customers and counterparties. This could result in losses, reputational damage, litigation or costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 54\nRisk Factors\nA deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly home prices and employment trends, or the financial markets may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur business is significantly affected by the status of the U.S. economy, particularly home prices and employment trends. A prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. economy or any deterioration in general economic conditions or the financial markets could materially adversely affect our results of operations, net worth and financial condition. In general, if home prices decrease, or the unemployment rate increases, it could result in significantly higher levels of credit losses and credit-related expense. For example, as we describe earlier in this section under \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic Risk,\u201d the economic dislocation cause by the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed us to substantial credit-related expenses and risk of credit losses.\nGlobal economic conditions can also adversely affect our business and financial results. Changes or volatility in market conditions resulting from deterioration in or uncertainty regarding global economic conditions can adversely affect the value of our assets, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, net worth and financial condition. A slowdown in economic growth around the world remains a concern for policy makers and financial markets. To the extent global economic conditions negatively affect the U.S. economy, they also could negatively affect the credit performance of the loans in our book of business.\nVolatility or uncertainty in global or domestic political conditions also can significantly affect economic conditions and the financial markets. Global or domestic political unrest also could affect growth and financial markets. We describe above the risks to our business posed by changes in interest rates and changes in spreads. In addition, future changes or disruptions in the financial markets could significantly change the amount, mix and cost of funds we obtain, as well as our liquidity position.\nA decline in activity in the U.S. housing market or increasing interest rates could lower our business volumes or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, net worth and financial condition.\nOur business volume is affected by the rate of growth in total U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the U.S. residential mortgage market. A decline in mortgage debt outstanding reduces the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans available for us to acquire, which in turn could reduce our net interest income and adversely affect our financial results. Various factors may impact our business volume, including:\n\u2022Rising interest rates, which generally result in fewer mortgage originations, particularly for refinances.\n\u2022Lower home prices and multifamily property valuations, which could preclude some borrowers from being able to refinance their loans.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\nRegulatory changes in the financial services industry may negatively impact our business.\nChanges in the regulation of the financial services industry are affecting and are expected to continue to affect many aspects of our business. Changes to financial regulations could affect our business directly or indirectly if they affect our customers and counterparties. Examples of regulatory changes that have affected us or may affect us in the future include: rules requiring the clearing of certain derivatives transactions and margin and capital rules for uncleared derivative trades, which impose additional costs on us; and the Dodd-Frank Act risk retention and single-counterparty credit limit requirements.\nOur business and results also may be adversely affected by changes in the CFPB\u2019s \u201cability-to-repay\u201d rule to replace the \u201cqualified mortgage patch,\u201d including changes to the rule discussed in \u201cBusiness-Legislation and Regulation-GSE Act and Other Legislative and Regulatory Matters.\u201d Although the ability-to-repay rule does not apply directly to us, the rule applies to the lenders from which we acquire single-family mortgage loans. And because FHFA has instructed and the senior preferred stock purchase agreement requires that, with respect to loans that are subject to TILA ability-to-repay standards, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shall only acquire loans that are qualified mortgages under the ability-to-repay rule with minor exceptions, provisions in the new rule may reduce the volume of loans that are eligible for delivery to us, and may increase the competition we face for the acquisition and guaranty of such loans.\nChanges in regulations applicable to U.S. banks could affect the volume and characteristics of mortgage loans available in the market.\nChanges in regulations could also affect demand for our debt and MBS, as U.S. banks purchase a large amount of our debt securities and MBS. New or revised liquidity or capital requirements applicable to U.S. banks could materially affect banks\u2019 willingness to deliver loans to us and demand by those banks for our debt securities and MBS. Developments in connection with the single-counterparty credit limit regulations, including those taken in anticipation of our eventual exit from conservatorship, could also cause our customers to change their business practices.\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 55\nRisk Factors\nThe actions of Treasury, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve and international central banking authorities directly or indirectly impact financial institutions\u2019 cost of funds for lending, capital-raising and investment activities, which could increase our borrowing costs or make borrowing more difficult for us. Changes in monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult to anticipate.\nOverall, these legislative and regulatory changes could affect us in substantial and unforeseeable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nLegislative, regulatory or judicial actions could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or net worth.\nLegislative, regulatory or judicial actions at the federal, state or local level could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or net worth. Legislative, regulatory or judicial actions could affect us in a number of ways, including by imposing significant additional costs on us and diverting management attention or other resources. For example, we were affected by loan forbearance requirements of the CARES act and, among other things, we could also be affected by:\n\u2022Designation as a systemically important financial institution. In September 2020, the FSOC announced that it had completed an activities based review of the secondary mortgage market. It noted that any distress at the GSEs that affected their secondary mortgage market activities could pose a risk to financial stability if the risks are not properly mitigated and concluded that it will continue to monitor the secondary mortgage market activities of the GSEs and FHFA\u2019s implementation of the regulatory framework to ensure potential risks to financial stability are adequately addressed. If the FSOC determines that such risks to financial stability are not adequately addressed by FHFA\u2019s capital and other regulatory requirements or other risk mitigants, the FSOC may consider more formal recommendations or other actions.\n\u2022Legislative or regulatory changes that expand our, or our servicers\u2019, responsibility and liability for securing, maintaining or otherwise overseeing properties prior to foreclosure, which could increase our costs.\n\u2022Court decisions concluding that we or our affiliates are governmental actors, which could impose additional burdens and requirements on us.\n\u2022State laws and court decisions granting new or expanded priority rights over our mortgages to homeowners associations or through initiatives that provide a lien priority to loans used to finance energy efficiency or similar improvements, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our losses on affected loans.\n\u2022Other agencies of the U.S. government or Congress asking us to take actions to support the housing and mortgage markets or in support of other goals. For example, in December 2011 Congress enacted the TCCA under which we increased our guaranty fee on all single-family mortgages delivered to us by 10 basis points. The revenue generated by this fee increase is paid to Treasury.\nGeneral Risk\nOur business and financial results could be materially adversely affected by legal or regulatory proceedings.\nWe are a party to various claims and other legal proceedings. We are periodically involved in government investigations. We may be required to establish accruals and to make substantial payments in the event of adverse judgments or settlements of any such claims, investigations or proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth. Any legal proceeding or governmental investigation, even if resolved in our favor, could result in negative publicity or cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses. In addition, responding to these matters could divert significant internal resources away from managing our business.\nIn addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against the U.S. government relating to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and the conservatorship. See \u201cNote 16, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a description of these lawsuits. These lawsuits, and actions Treasury or FHFA may take in response to these lawsuits, could have a material impact on our business.\nChanges in accounting standards and policies can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial results.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, the FASB or the SEC changes the financial accounting and reporting standards or the policies that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, FHFA provides guidance that affects our adoption or implementation of financial accounting or reporting standards. These changes can be difficult to predict and expensive to implement, and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively,\nFannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 56\nRisk Factors\nwhich may result in the revision of prior-period financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised accounting guidance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or net worth.\nIn many cases, our accounting policies and methods, which are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management also relies on models in making these estimates.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in applying many of these accounting policies and methods so that they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the appropriate accounting policy or method from two or more acceptable alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances but might affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that we report. See \u201cNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for a description of our significant accounting policies.\nWe have identified our allowance for loan losses accounting policy as critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. This policy is described in \u201cMD&A-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d We believe this policy is critical because it requires management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nBecause our financial statements involve estimates for amounts that are very large, even a small change in the estimate can have a significant impact for the reporting period. For example, because our allowance for loan losses is so large, even a change that has a small impact relative to the size of this allowance can have a meaningful impact on our results for the quarter in which we make the change. Because loans are evaluated for impairment under the CECL standard, our credit-related income or expense now reflects expected lifetime losses, rather than just incurred losses, as were recognized under the pre-CECL model. As a result, the CECL standard has introduced additional volatility to our results.\nMany of our accounting methods involve substantial use of models, which are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on assumptions, including about future events. For example, we will determine expected lifetime losses on loans and other financial instruments subject to the CECL standard using models. Our actual results could differ significantly from those generated by our models. As a result, the estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements, as well as our estimates of our future results of operations, may be inaccurate, perhaps significantly.", "PERMNO": 51043, "SIC": 6111, "TIC": "FNMA"}
