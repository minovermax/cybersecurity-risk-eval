{"cik": "930420", "company": "KFORCE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nKforce faces significant employment-related legal risk.\nKforce employs people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. An inherent risk of such activity includes possible discrimination and harassment claims; wrongful termination; violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues; classification of workers as employees or independent contractors; violations of wage and hour requirements; employment of illegal aliens; criminal activity; torts; or other claims. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, civil litigation, payment by Kforce of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse effects on our business. To reduce our exposure, we maintain insurance coverage for professional malpractice liability, fidelity, employment practices liability, and general liability in amounts and with deductibles that we believe is appropriate for our operations. Our insurance coverage, however, may not cover all potential claims against us, may require us to meet a deductible or may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. In this regard, we face various employment-related risks not covered by insurance, such as wage and hour laws and employment tax responsibility. U.S. Courts in recent years have been receiving large numbers of wage and hour class action claims alleging misclassification of overtime eligible workers and/or failure to pay overtime-eligible workers for all hours worked. In addition, there appears to be a heightened state and federal scrutiny of independent contractor relationships, which could adversely affect us given that we utilize a significant number of independent contractors to perform our services. An adverse determination of the independent contractor status of these firms could result in a substantial tax or other liabilities.\nKforce may be exposed to unforeseeable negative acts by our personnel that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn inherent risk of employing people internally and in the workplace of other businesses is that many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information. Such activity includes possible acts of errors and omissions; intentional misconduct; release, misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property, confidential information, funds, or other property; cyber security breaches affecting our clients and/or us; or other acts. Such acts may result in negative publicity or other material adverse effects on our business. In addition, these occurrences may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive. To reduce our exposure, we maintain insurance coverage for types and amounts we believe are appropriate in light of the aforementioned exposures. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies and practices we have in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks.\nOur business is significantly affected by fluctuations in general economic conditions.\nDemand for staffing services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity and employment in the United States. Based upon previous economic cycles experienced by Kforce, we believe that times of sustained economic recovery generally stimulate demand for additional U.S. workers and, conversely, an economic slowdown results in a contraction in demand for additional U.S. workers. As economic activity slows, companies may defer projects for which they utilize our services or reduce their use of temporary employees before laying off full-time employees. In addition, an economic downturn could result in a reduction in the temporary staffing penetration rate, an increase in the unemployment rate and a deceleration of growth in the segments in which we operate. We may also experience more competitive pricing pressures during periods of economic downturn. Approximately 98% of our revenue is generated by our business operations in the United States. Any substantial economic downturn in the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nKforce may be adversely affected by government regulation of the staffing business and of the workplace.\nOur business is subject to regulation and licensing in many states. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. If we fail to comply, such failure could materially adversely affect Kforce\u2019s financial results.\nA large part of our business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients\u2019 workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship could have a material adverse effect on Kforce.\nOur collection, use and retention of personal information and personal health information create risks that may harm our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and retain personal information of our associates and Flexible Employees and their dependents including, without limitation, full names, social security numbers, addresses, birth dates, and payroll-related information. We use commercially available information security technologies to protect such information in digital format. We also use security and business controls to limit access to such information. However, employees or third parties (including third parties with substantially greater resources than our own; for example, foreign governments) may be able to circumvent these measures and acquire or misuse such information, resulting in breaches of privacy, and errors in the storage, use or transmission of such information. Privacy breaches may require notification and other remedies, which can be costly, and which may have other serious adverse consequences for our business, including regulatory penalties and fines, claims for breach of contract, claims for damages, adverse publicity, reduced demand for our services by clients and/or flex employment candidates, harm to our reputation, and regulatory oversight by state or federal agencies.\nThe possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.\nKforce may be adversely affected by immigration restrictions.\nOur Tech business utilizes a significant number of foreign nationals employed by us on work visas, primarily under the H-1B visa classification. The H-1B visa classification that enables U.S. employers to hire qualified foreign nationals is subject to legislative and administrative changes, as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement. Immigration laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political developments and levels of economic activity. Current and future restrictions on the availability of such visas could restrain our ability to employ the skilled professionals we need to meet our clients\u2019 needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In 2009, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) significantly increased its scrutiny of companies seeking to sponsor, renew or transfer H-1B status, including Kforce and Kforce\u2019s subcontractors. On January 8, 2010, the USCIS issued internal guidance to its field offices that appears to narrow the eligibility criteria for H-1B status in the context of staffing services. In addition to USCIS restrictions, certain aspects of the H-1B program are also subject to regulation and review by the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of State, which have recently increased enforcement activities in the program. A narrow interpretation and vigorous enforcement, or legislative action relating to immigration, including legislation intended to reform existing immigration law, could adversely affect our ability to obtain foreign national labor and/or renew existing foreign national consultants on assignment, and could subject us to fines, penalties and sanctions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep or replace all foreign nationals currently on assignment, or continue to hire foreign national talent at the same rates as in the past.\nKforce maintains debt which could impact operating flexibility and contains restrictive covenants that could trigger prepayment of obligations or additional costs.\nWe have a credit facility consisting of a revolving line of credit of up to $170 million. Borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Firm, excluding the real estate located at the Firm's corporate headquarters in Tampa, FL, unless the eligible real estate conditions are met.\nOur level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreement could have important consequences for investors including the following: (1) we will have to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt services rather than for our operations; (2) we may not be able to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing; (3) we could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and (4) we may be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage.\nKforce is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the credit facility. Our failure to comply with such restrictive covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in Kforce being required to repay the outstanding balance before the due date. We may not be able to repay our debt or if forced to refinance on terms not acceptable to us could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nKforce\u2019s temporary staffing business could be adversely impacted by health care reform.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PPACA) imposes new mandates on individuals and employers, requiring most individuals to have health insurance. Beginning in 2015, the PPACA assesses penalties on large employers that do not offer health insurance meeting certain coverage, value, or affordability standards. While we believe the costs associated with the law may have less of an impact on Kforce than many other staffing companies due to the level and scope of benefits we offer, a delay in or inability to increase bill rates charged to our customers could result in a reduction of our Flex gross profit. In addition, because the regulations governing the PPACA\u2019s employer mandate are new and subject to interpretation, it is possible that Kforce may incur liability in the form of penalties, fines, or damages if the health plans we offer are subsequently found not to meet minimum essential coverage, affordability or minimum value standards, or if our method for determining eligibility for coverage is found inadequate or our clients seek indemnification for health care claims resulting from consultants working on client assignments. The cost of any such penalties, fines or damages could have a material adverse effect on Kforce\u2019s financial and operating results.\nWe are exposed to intangible asset risk which could result in future impairment.\nA significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our (or in one or more of our reporting units\u2019) expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates, or changes in our business strategy have resulted, and could result in the future, in the need to perform an impairment analysis. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, it could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position. See Note 6 - \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d for further details, including the details regarding the goodwill impairment losses within our GS reporting unit in recent years.\nSignificant legal actions could subject Kforce to substantial uninsured liabilities.\nProfessional service providers are subject to legal actions alleging malpractice, breach of contract and other legal theories. These actions may involve large claims and significant defense costs. We may also be subject to claims alleging violations of federal or state labor laws. In addition, we may be subject to claims related to torts, intentional acts, or crimes committed by our full-time employees or temporary staffing personnel. In some instances, we are contractually obligated to indemnify clients against such risks. A failure to observe the applicable standard of care, relevant Kforce or client policies and guidelines, or applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws, rules, and regulations could result in negative publicity, payment of fines, significant damage awards, or settlement expense. To reduce our exposure, we maintain insurance coverage for professional malpractice liability, fidelity, employment practices liability and general liability, in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations. Our insurance coverage, however, may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost.\nDelays or defaults in collecting our trade accounts receivable could adversely affect our business.\nWe generate a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from our customers. Delays or defaults in payments owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could cause a delay or default include business failures, turmoil in the financial and credit markets, sluggish or recessionary U.S. economic conditions, our exposure to customers in high-risk sectors such as the financial services industry, and declines in the credit worthiness of our customers. See Note 1 - \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nKforce\u2019s success depends upon retaining the services of its management team and key operating employees.\nKforce is highly dependent on its management team and expects that continued success will depend largely upon their efforts and abilities. The loss of the services of any key executive for any reason could have a material adverse effect upon Kforce. Success also depends upon our ability to identify, develop, and retain qualified operating employees; particularly management, client servicing, and candidate recruiting employees. Kforce expends significant resources in the recruiting and training of its employees, as the pool of available applicants for these positions is limited. The loss of some of our key operating employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to establish and maintain client and candidate, professional, and technical relationships.\nThe financial markets may experience significant turmoil, which may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing.\nKforce's liquidity is dependent in part on our revolving credit facility, which is provided by a syndicate of banks. Our liquidity may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our credit facility, or another financial institution, suffers liquidity issues. In such an event, we may not be able to draw on any of the amounts available under our credit facility, or a substantial portion thereof. If we attempt to obtain future financing in addition to, or as a replacement of, our credit facility, financial market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing on favorable terms.\nKforce depends on the proper functioning of its information systems.\nKforce is dependent on the proper functioning of information systems in operating its business. Critical information systems are used in every aspect of Kforce\u2019s daily operations, most significantly, in the identification and matching of staffing resources to client assignments and in the customer billing and consultant or vendor payment functions. Kforce\u2019s information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters (we are headquartered and our leased data center are located in a hurricane-prone area), fire or casualty theft, technical failures, terrorist acts, cyber security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or software intrusions, computer viruses, and similar events. If our critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, we would have to accomplish these functions manually, which could prove difficult or impossible, causing a material adverse effect on our business. Also, any theft or misuse of information resulting from a security breach could result in, among other things, loss of significant and/or sensitive information, litigation by affected parties, financial obligations resulting from such theft or misuse, higher insurance premiums, governmental investigations, negative reactions from current and potential future customers (including potential negative financial ramifications under certain customer contract provisions) and poor publicity and any of these could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we depend on third-party vendors for certain functions (including the operations of our leased data center), whose future performance and reliability we cannot control.\nSignificant increases in payroll-related costs could adversely affect Kforce\u2019s business.\nKforce is required to pay a number of federal, state, and local payroll and related costs, including unemployment taxes, workers\u2019 compensation and insurance premiums and claims, FICA, and Medicare, among others, related to our employees. Significant increases in the effective rates of any payroll-related costs would likely have a material adverse effect on Kforce. Over the last few years, many of the states in which Kforce conducts business have continued to significantly increase their state unemployment tax rates in an effort to increase funding for unemployment benefits. Costs could also increase as a result of health care reforms or the possible imposition of additional requirements and restrictions related to the placement of personnel. We may not be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner or in a sufficient amount to cover these potential cost increases.\nAdverse results in tax audits could result in significant cash expenditures or exposure to unforeseen liabilities.\nKforce is subject to periodic federal, state, and local tax audits for various tax years. Although Kforce attempts to comply with all taxing authority regulations, adverse findings or assessments made by taxing authorities as the result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on Kforce.\nDue to inherent limitations, there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors and fraud, or in making all material information known in a timely manner to management.\nOur management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Kforce have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.\nThe design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur business is dependent upon maintaining our reputation, our relationships, and our performance.\nThe reputation and relationships that we have established and currently maintain with our customers are important to maintaining existing business and identifying new business. If our reputation or relationships were damaged, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, if our performance does not meet our customers\u2019 expectations, our revenues and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe rely on short-term engagements with most of our clients.\nBecause long-term engagements are not a significant part of our business, other than in our GS segment, future financial results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.\nKforce\u2019s current market share may decrease as a result of limited barriers to entry for new competitors and discontinuation of clients outsourcing their staffing needs.\nWe face significant competition in the markets we serve, and there are limited barriers to entry for new competitors. The competition among staffing services firms is intense. Kforce competes for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants, temporary personnel agencies, search firms, and other providers of staffing services. Some of our competitors possess substantially greater resources than we do. From time to time, we experience significant pressure from our clients to reduce price levels. During these periods, we may face increased competitive pricing pressures and may not be able to recruit the personnel necessary to fulfill our clients\u2019 needs. We also face the risk that certain of our current and prospective clients will decide to provide similar services internally.\nCompetition for acquisition opportunities may restrict Kforce\u2019s future growth by limiting our ability to make acquisitions at reasonable valuations.\nKforce has increased its market share and presence in the staffing industry partly through strategic acquisitions of companies that have complemented or enhanced its business. We have historically faced competition for acquisitions. In the future, this could limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly non-accretive to us. In addition, Kforce may be limited by its ability to obtain financing to consummate desirable acquisitions.\nKforce may not be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel.\nKforce depends upon the abilities of its staff to attract and retain personnel, particularly technical, professional, and cleared government services personnel, who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our clients. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. We expect significant competition for individuals with proven technical or professional skills for the foreseeable future. If qualified personnel are not available to us in sufficient numbers and upon economic terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nKforce may face significant risk arising from acquisitions or dispositions.\nKforce may face difficulties integrating future acquisitions into existing operations and acquisitions may be unsuccessful, involve significant cash expenditures, or expose Kforce to unforeseen liabilities.\nThese acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or clients of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired personnel and distinct cultures into a single business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from existing operations; and\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies.\nThese acquisitions may also involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, integration expenses, and exposure to unforeseen liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business and financial condition. In addition, dispositions involve risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to identify acceptable buyers;\n\u2022\nwe may divest a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe may lose key employees;\n\u2022\ndivestitures could adversely affect our profitability and, under certain circumstances, require us to record impairment charges or a loss as a result of the transaction;\n\u2022\ncompleting divestitures requires expenses and management effort;\n\u2022\nwe may become subject to indemnity obligations and/or remain liable or contingently liable for obligations related to the divested business or operations;\n\u2022\nwe may retain of certain continuing liabilities under contracts;\n\u2022\ncovenants not to compete could impair our ability to attract and retain customers; and\n\u2022\nwe may face difficulties in the separation of the divested operations, services, products and personnel.\nProvisions in Kforce\u2019s articles and bylaws and under Florida law may have certain anti-takeover effects.\nKforce\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws and Florida law contain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a non-negotiated merger or other business combination. In particular, our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board of directors and permit the removal of directors only for cause. Additionally, the Board may issue up to 15 million shares of preferred stock, and fix the rights and preferences thereof, without a further vote of the shareholders. In addition, certain of our officers and managers have employment agreements containing certain provisions that call for substantial payments to be made to such employees in certain circumstances upon a change in control. Certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of Kforce, including an acquisition in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. As a result, shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so. Moreover, the existence of these provisions could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nKforce\u2019s stock price may be volatile.\nKforce\u2019s common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market using the ticker symbol \u201cKFRC.\u201d The market price of our stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future, based on a variety of factors, including our operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy, the financial markets, the employment services industry, or other developments affecting us, our clients, or our competitors; some of which may be unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, especially The NASDAQ Global Select Market tier, along with market prices for staffing companies, has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating results.\nAmong other things, volatility in our stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices they pay. The volatility also could impair our ability in the future to offer common stock as a source of additional capital or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR GOVERNMENT BUSINESS\nOur GS segment is substantially dedicated to contracting with and serving U.S. Federal Government agencies (the \u201cFederal Agency Business\u201d). In addition, Kforce supplies services to the Federal Government. Federal contractors, including Kforce face a number of risks, including the following:\nOur failure to comply with complex federal procurement laws and regulations could cause us to lose business, incur additional costs, and subject us to a variety of penalties, including suspension and debarment from doing business with the Federal Government.\nWe must comply with complex laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of Federal Government contracts. These laws and regulations create compliance risk, affect how we do business with our federal agency clients, and may impose added costs on our business. If a government review, audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, harm to our reputation, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with Federal Government agencies.\nThe Federal Government also may reform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, including cost accounting standards, that could be costly to satisfy or that could impact our ability to obtain new contracts. A failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in contract termination, price or fee reductions, or suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal Government; each of which could lead to a material reduction in our revenues, cash flows and operating results.\nUnfavorable government audit results could force us to refund previously recognized revenues and could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions.\nFederal agencies can audit and review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, incurred cost submissions and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. An audit of our work, including an audit of work performed by companies Kforce has acquired or may acquire, or subcontractors we have hired or may hire, could force us to refund previously recognized revenues.\nIf a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with Federal Government agencies. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us, whether or not true.\nWe are dependent upon the ability of government agencies to administratively manage our contracts.\nAfter we are awarded a contract and the contract is funded by the Federal Government, we are still dependent upon the ability of the relevant agency to administratively manage our contract. We can be adversely impacted by delays in the start-up of already awarded and funded projects, including delays due to shortages of acquisition and contracting personnel within the Federal Government agencies.\nThe failure by Congress to approve budgets, raise the U.S. debt ceiling or avoid sequestration on a timely basis for the federal agencies we support could delay, reduce or stop federal spending and cause us to lose revenue or impair our intangible assets.\nOn an annual basis, Congress must approve and the President must sign the appropriation bills that govern spending by each of the federal agencies we support. If Congress is unable to agree on budget priorities and is unable to appropriate funds or pass the annual budget on a timely basis, as has been the case in recent years, there may be delays, reductions or cessations of funding for our services and solutions. In addition, from time to time it has been necessary for Congress to raise the U.S. debt ceiling in order to allow for borrowing necessary to fund government operations. If that becomes necessary again and Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling on a timely basis, there may be delays, reductions or cessations of funding for our services and solutions. Furthermore, legislatively mandated cuts in federal programs, known as sequestration, could result in delays, reductions or cessation of funding for our services and solutions.\nChanges in the spending policies or budget priorities of the Federal Government could cause us to lose revenue.\nChanges in Federal Government fiscal or spending policies could materially adversely affect our Federal Agency Business; in particular, our business could be materially adversely affected by decreases in Federal Government spending.\nOur Federal Agency Business is dependent upon maintaining our reputation, our relationships and our performance.\nThe reputation and relationships that we have established and currently maintain with government agencies are important to maintaining existing business and identifying new business. If our reputation or relationships were damaged, it could have a material adverse effect. In addition, if our performance does not meet agency expectations, our revenues and operating results could be materially harmed.\nCompetition is intense in the Federal Agency Business.\nThere is often intense competition to win federal agency contracts. Even when a contract is awarded to us, competitors may protest such awards. If we are unable to successfully compete for new business or win competitions to maintain existing business, our operations could be materially adversely affected. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources, larger client bases, and greater brand recognition than we do. Our larger competitors also may be able to provide clients with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide.\nLoss of our General Services Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) Schedules or other contracting vehicles could impair our ability to win new business.\nGSA Schedules constitute a significant percentage of revenues from our federal agency clients. If we were to lose one or more of these Schedules or other contracting vehicles, we could lose revenues and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. These Schedules or contracts typically have an initial term with multiple options that may be exercised by our government agency clients to extend the contract for successive periods of one or more years. We can provide no assurance that our clients will exercise these options.\nOur failure to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances may limit our ability to perform classified work for government clients, which could cause us to lose business.\nSome government contracts require us to maintain facility security clearances and require some of our employees to maintain individual security clearances. If our employees lose or are unable to timely obtain security clearances, or we lose a facility clearance, a government agency client may terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could harm our business.\nLike all government contractors, we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur. Misconduct by our employees could include intentional failures to comply with Federal Government procurement regulations, engaging in unauthorized activities, seeking reimbursement for improper expenses, or falsifying time records. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of our clients\u2019 sensitive or classified information, which could result in regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and precautions to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling such risks or losses, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nSecurity breaches in sensitive government information systems could result in the loss of our clients and cause negative publicity.\nMany of the systems we develop, install, and maintain involve managing and protecting information used in intelligence, national security, and other sensitive or classified government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business, damage our reputation, and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive or classified systems for Federal Government clients. We could incur losses from such a security breach that could exceed the policy limits under our insurance. Damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work resulting from a security breach in one of our systems could materially reduce our revenues.\nWe are the prime contractor on many of our contracts and if our subcontractors fail to appropriately perform their obligations, our performance and our ability to win future contracts could be harmed.\nFor many of our contracts where we are the prime contractor, we involve subcontractors, which we rely on to perform a portion of the services that we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed or customer concerns about the subcontractor\u2019s performance. In addition, the contracting parties on which we rely may be affected by changes in the economic environment and constraints on available financing to meet their performance requirements or provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A failure by one or more of those contracting parties to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis may affect our ability to perform our obligations.", "PERMNO": 82212, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "KFRC"}
