{"cik": "1095981", "company": "CYTORI THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn analyzing our company, you should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d. If any of the risks described below occur, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected and the value of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n* We will need to raise more cash in the future\nWe have almost always had negative cash flows from operations. Our business will continue to result in a substantial requirement for research and development expenses for several years, during which we may not be able to bring in sufficient cash and/or revenues to offset these expenses. We have had, and we will continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to continue funding our operations to profitability. We do not currently believe that our cash balance and the revenues from our operations will be sufficient to fund the development and marketing efforts required to reach profitability without raising additional capital from accessible sources of financing in the very near future.\nTo date, these operating losses have been funded primarily from outside sources of invested capital and gross profits. We have had, and we will likely continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our future operations. However, our ability to raise capital on terms attractive to us was adversely affected once FDA put a hold on our Athena trials in mid-2014, which had an adverse impact to stock price performance and our corresponding ability to restructure our debt. More recently, a continued downward trend in our stock price resulting from general economic and industry conditions as well as the market\u2019s unfavorable view of our recent equity financings (which financings were priced at a discount to market and included 100% warrant coverage and our Nasdaq listing deficiency, have made it more difficult to procure additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise outside capital in the near term, we will be required to significantly reduce our research, development, and administrative operations, including reduction of our employee base, in order to offset the lack of available funding. We expect to continue to utilize our cash and cash equivalents to fund operations at least through September of 2016, subject to minimum cash and cash liquidity requirements contained in that certain Loan and Security Agreement, dated May 29, 2015, with Oxford Finance, LLC (\u201cOxford\u201d), as further described below (the \u201cLoan and Security Agreement\u201d), which requires that we maintain at least $5 million of cash on hand to avoid an event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement.\nWe have been placing, and will continue to place, significant effort into raising additional capital that will provide adequate capital resources to allow us to continue to fund our future operations. Based on our cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately $14 million at December 31, 2015, and our minimum liquidity requirements under the Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford that requires us to make interest payments of $136,000 per month (but which will require principal and interest payments commencing January 2017) and our obligation to maintain at least $5 million of cash on hand, we estimate that we must raise additional capital and/or obtain a waiver or restructure the Loan and Security Agreement on or before July, 2016 to avoid an event of default under it. If we are unable to avoid an event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement , Oxford would have the right to cause the outstanding loan amount of approximately $17.7 million to become immediately due and payable. Our financing plans include pursuing additional cash through use of our at-the-market offering program (\u201cATM\u201d), strategic corporate partnerships, licensing and sales of equity. While we have an established history of raising capital through these platforms, and we are currently involved in negotiations with multiple parties, there is no guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed from additional debt or equity financing, development and commercialization partnerships or from other sources, or on terms acceptable to us. There is also no guarantee that that we will be able to service our existing debt to Oxford. If our efforts to obtain sufficient additional funds are not successful, in addition to the lender\u2019s ability to cause the loan amount to be immediately due and payable, we would at a minimum be required to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our research or product development, manufacturing operations, administrative operations, including our employee base, and clinical or regulatory activities, which could negatively affect our ability to achieve certain corporate goals. In addition, the indebtedness under our Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford is secured by a security interest in substantially all of our existing and after-acquired assets, excluding our intellectual property assets which are subject to a negative pledge, and therefore, if we are unable to repay such indebtedness, the lender could foreclose on these assets, which would, at a minimum, have a severe material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.\nIn addition to the funding sources previously mentioned, we continue to seek additional capital through product revenues, strategic transactions, IP licensing, and State and Federal development programs, including additional funding opportunities though our current BARDA contract.\n*Our level of indebtedness, and covenant restrictions under such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity\nUnder our Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford, as collateral agent and lender, Oxford agreed to make a term loan to us in an aggregate principal amount of $17,700,000 (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cLoan Facility\u201d). In connection with securing the Loan Facility, we prepaid all outstanding amounts under our Loan and Security Agreement, dated June 28, 2013, with Oxford and Silicon Valley Bank.\nThe Term Loan accrues interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate (with a floor of 1.00%) plus 7.95% per annum. In February 2016, Oxford acknowledged that we had received positive data on our ACT-OA clinical trial, which acknowledgement automatically deferred commencement of the Amortization Commencement Date under the Loan and Security Agreement from June 1, 2016 to January 1, 2017, thus extending our interest-only payment period for six months. The Company is required to make payments of principal and accrued interest in equal monthly installments sufficient to amortize the Term Loan through June 1, 2019, the maturity date. All unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to the Term Loan is due and payable in full on June 1, 2019.\nAs security for its obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company granted a security interest in substantially all of its existing and after-acquired assets, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement and excluding its intellectual property assets, which are subject to a negative pledge by the Company.\nOur indebtedness to Oxford could adversely affect our operations and liquidity, by, among other things:\n\u00b7 causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flow to fund interest and principal payments, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures and other business activities;\n\u00b7 making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\nThe Loan Agreement requires us to maintain at least three months of cash on hand and includes certain reporting and other covenants, that, among other things, restrict our ability to: (i) dispose of assets, (ii) change the business we conduct, (iii) make acquisitions, (iv) engage in mergers or consolidations, (v) incur additional indebtedness, (vi) create liens on assets, (vii) maintain any collateral account, (viii) pay dividends, (ix) make investments, loans or advances, (x) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and (xi) prepay certain other indebtedness or amend other financing arrangements. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants or restrictions, such failure may result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the lender accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and such acceleration would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, the indebtedness under our Loan and Security Agreement is secured by a security interest in substantially all of our existing and after-acquired assets, excluding our intellectual property assets (which is subject to a negative pledge), and therefore, if we are unable to repay such indebtedness, the Lender could foreclose on these assets, which would, at a minimum, have a severe material effect on our ability to operate our business. Further, if we fail to receive positive data on our ACT-OA clinical trial, as determined by Oxford, or close a licensing, partnership or similar transaction on terms acceptable to Oxford by May 31, 2016, we will be required to commence making principal payments in July 2016, which payments will materially decrease cash available for operations and make us more reliant on obtaining outside sources of additional capital.\n*We could be delisted from NASDAQ, which could seriously harm the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital\nOn June 4, 2015, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of the our common stock for the previous 30 consecutive trading days, we no longer met the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until December 1, 2015, in which to regain compliance. We were unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement within this 180-day period, and on December 3, 2015, we received a Staff Determination Letter notifying us that our stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market unless we appealed the determination to the Nasdaq Hearing Panel, or we were eligible to transfer from the Nasdaq Global Market, or NGM, to the Nasdaq Capital Market, or NCM. Though we were eligible to transfer to the NCM, we elected to appeal the delisting determination to the Nasdaq Hearing Panel, which election stayed the Nasdaq Staff\u2019s determination pending the Hearing Panel\u2019s decision on our appeal. The hearing was held on January 21, 2016, and on January 27, 2016, the Nasdaq Hearing Panel issued its determination letter which it granted us an additional 180-day period (expiring May 31, 2016) to come into compliance with its minimum bid price requirement, and which required that:\n\u00b7 By mid-March, 2016, we shall have filed our definite proxy for a stockholders meeting which includes a request to approve a reverse stock split to bring our stock priced above $1;\n\u00b7 On or before May 10, 2016, we shall have held a stockholders meeting at which the stockholders approve a reverse stock sufficient to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum $1 bid price requirement;\n\u00b7 On or before May 31, 2016, we shall have demonstrated a closing bid price of $1 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days.\nThe Company transferred the listing of its common stock from The NASDAQ Global Market tier to The NASDAQ Capital Market tier on February 1, 2016 and on February 10, 2016, the Listing Qualification Staff sent a letter to the Company approving and confirming the Company\u2019s move from the NGM tier to the NGM tier. In the event we do not cure our listing deficiency by May 31, 2016, Nasdaq will provide us notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or maintain compliance with the other listing requirements, or that we will be eligible for listing on the NGM, NCM or any comparable trading market. To regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid requirement, we have committed to consummate a reverse stock split at our annual stockholder meeting (unless our stock price organically rises above $1 and cures our bid price deficiency), which split would likely be unfavorably received by the market and could further depress the market for our shares. There is no guarantee that a reverse stock split, if consummated, would cure, in the short-term or long-term, our Nasdaq listing deficiencies. If we cease to be eligible to trade on either the NGM or NCM:\n\u00b7 we would be forced to seek to be traded on a less recognized or accepted exchange or market such as the OTC Bulletin Board or the \u201cpink sheets;\u201d\n\u00b7 the trading price of our common stock would be adversely affected, including an increased spread between the \u201cbid\u201d and \u201casked\u201d prices quoted by market makers;\n\u00b7 the liquidity and marketability of shares of our common stock would be adversely affected, thereby reducing the ability of holders of our common stock to purchase or sell our shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically (if our stock is traded as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d transactions in our stock would be more difficult and cumbersome);\n\u00b7 our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us (or at all) would be adversely affected, as companies trading on the OCT Bulletin Board or \u201cpink sheets\u201d are viewed as less attractive investments with materially higher associated risks, such that existing or prospective institutional investors may be less interested in, or prohibited from, investing in our common stock (which may also cause the market price of our common stock to decline).\nContinued turmoil in the economy could harm our business\nNegative trends in the general economy, including trends resulting from an actual or perceived recession, tightening credit markets, increased cost of commodities, including oil, actual or threatened military action by the United States and threats of terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad, could cause a reduction of investment in and available funding for companies in certain industries, including ours and our customers. Our ability to raise capital has been, and may in the future, be adversely affected by downturns in current credit conditions, financial markets and the global economy.\nWe have never been profitable on an operational basis and expect significant operating losses for at least the next one to two years\nWe have incurred net operating losses each year since we started business. As our focus on Cytori Cell Therapy, the Celution\u00ae System platform and development of therapeutic applications for Cytori Cell Therapy has increased, losses have resulted primarily from expenses associated with research and development activities and general and administrative expenses. While we have implemented and continue implement cost reduction measures where possible, we nonetheless expect to continue operating in a loss position on a consolidated basis and expect that recurring operating expenses will be at high levels for at least the next one to two years, in order to perform clinical trials, additional pre-clinical research, product development, and marketing. As a result of our historic losses, we have been, and are likely to continue to be, reliant on raising outside capital to fund our operations.\nOur business strategy is high-risk\nWe are focusing our resources and efforts primarily on development of the Celution\u00ae System family of products and the therapeutic applications of its cellular output, which requires extensive cash needs for research, development, and commercialization activities. This is a high-risk strategy because there is no assurance that our future products will ever become commercially viable (commercial risk), that we will prevent other companies from depriving us of market share and profit margins by selling products based on our inventions and developments (legal risk), that we will successfully manage a company in a new area of business (regenerative medicine) and on a different scale than we have operated in the past (operational risk), that we will be able to achieve the desired therapeutic results using stem and regenerative cells (scientific risk), or that our cash resources will be adequate to develop our products until we become profitable, if ever (financial risk). We are using our cash in one of the riskiest industries in the economy (strategic risk). This may make our stock an unsuitable investment for many investors.\nThe development and manufacture of current and future generation Celution\u00ae System devices is important to us\nWe must continue to develop and manufacture both the current and future generation Celution\u00ae System devices. If we are not successful in further development of the current and future generation Celution\u00ae System devices, we may not be able to compete successfully in the marketplace (technology risk), and if we experience disruptions and/or delays in our production of these devices as required by the marketplace, our operations and commercialization efforts (clinical, regulatory and/or commercial sales) would be harmed (manufacturing risk).\nAlthough we have significant experience in manufacturing the current Celution\u00ae System platform and its consumables at a commercial level, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and manufacture future generation Celution\u00ae Systems in a manner that is cost-effective or commercially viable, or that development and manufacturing capabilities might not take much longer than currently anticipated to be ready for the market.\nAlthough we have been manufacturing the Celution\u00ae 800 System and the StemSource\u00ae 900-based Cell Bank since 2008, we cannot assure that we will be able to manufacture sufficient numbers of such products to meet future demand, or that we will be able to overcome unforeseen manufacturing difficulties for this sophisticated equipment.\nOur operating results and stock price can be volatile\nOur prospects must be evaluated in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by emerging companies and particularly by such companies in rapidly evolving and technologically advanced biotech and medical device fields. From time to time, we have tried to update our investors\u2019 expectations as to our operating results by periodically announcing financial guidance. However, we have in the past been forced to revise or withdraw such guidance due to lack of visibility and predictability of product demand. Our stock price has a history of significant volatility, which may harm our ability to raise additional capital and may cause an investment in our company to be unsuitable for some investors.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls\nOur budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues from sales as well our assessment of the future investments needed to expand our commercial organization and support research and development activities. We may be unable to reduce our expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected events or a shortfall in revenue. Accordingly, a shortfall in demand for our products or other unexpected events could have an immediate and material impact on our business and financial condition.\nWe are vulnerable to competition and technological change, and also to physicians\u2019 inertia\nWe compete with many domestic and foreign companies in developing our technology and products, including biotechnology, medical device, and pharmaceutical companies. Many current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing, and personnel resources. There is no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing alternative products that are more effective, easier to use, or more economical than those which we have developed or are in the process of developing, or that would render our products obsolete and non-competitive. In general, we may not be able to prevent others from developing and marketing competitive products similar to ours or which perform similar functions.\nCompetitors may have greater experience in developing therapies or devices, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals, manufacturing and commercialization. It is possible that competitors may obtain patent protection, approval, or clearance from the FDA or achieve commercialization earlier than we can, any of which could have a substantial negative effect on our business.\nWe compete against cell-based therapies derived from alternate sources, such as bone marrow, umbilical cord blood and potentially embryos. Doctors historically are slow to adopt new technologies like ours, regardless of the perceived merits, when older technologies continue to be supported by established providers. Overcoming such inertia often requires very significant marketing expenditures or definitive product performance and/or pricing superiority.\nWe expect physicians\u2019 inertia and skepticism to also be a significant barrier as we attempt to gain market penetration with our future products. We believe we will continue to need to finance lengthy time-consuming clinical studies to provide evidence of the medical benefit of our products and resulting therapies in order to overcome this inertia and skepticism particularly in reconstructive surgery, cell preservation, osteoarthritis, scleroderma, cardiovascular indications and others.\n*Many potential applications of our technology are pre-commercialization, which subjects us to development and marketing risks\nWe are in a relatively early stage of the path to commercialization with many of our products. We believe that our long-term viability and growth will depend in large part on our ability to develop commercial quality cell processing devices and useful procedure-specific consumables, and to establish the safety and efficacy of our therapies through clinical trials and studies. With our Cytori Cell Therapy, we are pursuing new approaches for therapies for osteoarthritis, scleroderma, burns, soft tissue defects, reconstructive surgery, preservation of stem and regenerative cells for potential future use, and other conditions. There is no assurance that our development programs will be successfully completed or that required regulatory clearances or approvals will be obtained on a timely basis, if at all.\nThere is no proven path for commercializing Cytori Cell Therapy in a way to earn a durable profit commensurate with the medical benefit. Although we began to commercialize our reconstructive surgery products in Europe and certain Asian markets, and our cell banking products in Japan, Europe, and certain Asian markets in 2008, additional market opportunities for many of our products and/or services may not materialize for a number of years.\nSuccessful development and market acceptance of our products is subject to developmental risks, including failure of inventive imagination, ineffectiveness, lack of safety, unreliability, failure to receive necessary regulatory clearances or approvals, high commercial cost, preclusion or obsolescence resulting from third parties\u2019 proprietary rights or superior or equivalent products, competition from copycat products, and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns. There is no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop and commercialize Cytori Cell Therapy, or that our competitors will not develop competing technologies that are less expensive or superior. Failure to successfully develop and market Cytori Cell Therapy would have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf any party to a key collaboration partnership fails to perform material obligations under our agreements, or any other collaboration agreement, or if such agreements are terminated for any reason, our business could significantly suffer\nWe have entered into collaboration agreements under which we may receive future payments in the form of milestone payments, maintenance fees and royalties. We are dependent on our collaborators to commercialize Cytori Cell Therapy in certain countries in order for us to realize any financial benefits from these collaborations. Our collaborators may not devote the attention and resources to such efforts to be successful. In addition, in the event that a party fails to perform under a key collaboration agreement, or if a key collaboration agreement is terminated, the reduction in anticipated revenues could delay or suspend our commercialization efforts in certain countries. Specifically, the termination of a key collaboration agreement by one of our collaborators could materially impact our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements with new collaborators on favorable terms.\n*If we or our distributors or collaborators fail to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to the development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products, regulatory agencies may take action against us or them, which could significantly harm our business\nOur products and product candidates, along with the clinical development process, the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for these products, are subject to continual requirements and review by the FDA, state and foreign regulatory bodies. Regulatory authorities subject a marketed product, its manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities to continual review and periodic inspections. We, our distributors and collaborators and our and their respective contractors, suppliers and vendors, will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, including complying with regulations and laws regarding advertising, promotion and sales of products, required submissions of safety and other post-market information and reports, registration requirements, Clinical Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations (including requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation), and the requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping requirements. Regulatory agencies may change existing requirements or adopt new requirements or policies. We, our distributors and collaborators and our and their respective contractors, suppliers and vendors, may be slow to adapt or may not be able to adapt to these changes or new requirements.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in any of the following:\n\u2022 restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022 warning letters;\n\u2022 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022 voluntary or mandatory recall;\n\u2022 fines;\n\u2022 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 suspension or termination of any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022 product seizure;\n\u2022 injunctions; or\n\u2022 imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\n*We must rely on the performance of Lorem Vascular for the commercialization of our products in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia\nLorem Vascular is the exclusive licensee for our products in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia, and while we will are supportive of their efforts, they are responsible for obtaining regulatory approvals, market development and sales in these countries. Lorem Vascular is also a relatively new company and as such will be required to develop the expertise, personnel and relationships in each of these countries required to successfully market and sell our products. We cannot guarantee that Lorem Vascular will make the investments required to be successful in these countries. We cannot guarantee that the necessary regulatory approvals can be obtained, and we cannot guarantee that our products will be successful in these markets even if advantageous market regulatory approvals are obtained. In the absence of obtaining regulatory approvals required by applicable Chinese governmental entities such as the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Lorem Vascular may be unable to fully penetrate the Chinese market, and may be materially limited in its ability to sell our products. We believe that Lorem Vascular will be required to better understand the regulatory landscape in China and the conditions under which our technology may be successfully sold. However, no assurance can be given that Lorem Vascular will be able to successfully navigate any challenges presented by these regulations, or implement or successfully achieve a reasonable near or long-term regulatory or commercial strategy for China. Any such challenges could adversely affect Lorem Vascular\u2019s ability to penetrate the market, grow sales, and satisfy its product purchase minimums under our agreement with them.\nFurther, we are in discussions with Lorem Vascular to appropriately restructure our agreement with them. If we are unable to agree with Lorem Vascular on revised terms to our agreement, our relationship with them could suffer. A dispute may arise between us and Lorem Vascular that could lead to diversion of management time and attention and cause us to realize little if any sales or royalty revenues from sales activities in the territories under our exclusive license with Lorem Vascular . Even if we successfully restructure our agreement with Lorem Vascular, there can be no assurance that Lorem Vascular will be able to successfully grow its Celution business in China. Further, to the extent Lorem fails to comply with any regulations applicable to its marketing and commercialization of our products, we cannot assure you that regulators might not try to hold us responsible for such activities if they believe we somehow facilitated or were otherwise responsible for Lorem\u2019s actions.\nIf we are unable to successfully partner with other companies to commercialize our therapeutic offerings, our business could materially suffer\nWe intend to enter into strategic partnerships/collaborations to commercialize our indications, as we do not have the financial, human or other resources necessary to introduce and sell our therapeutic offerings in all of the geographies that we are targeting. We expect that our partners would provide regulatory and reimbursement/pricing expertise, sales and marketing resources, and other expertise and resources vital to the success of our product offerings in their territories. We further expect that these partnerships would include upfront cash payments to us in return for the rights to sell our products in specified territories, as well as downstream revenues in the form of milestone payment and royalties. If we are unable to identify suitable partners for our indications, including our lead ECCS-50 hand scleroderma indication, or if we are required to enter into agreements with such partners on unfavorable terms, our business and prospects could materially suffer. We are currently prioritizing our efforts to find a strategic partner for our hand scleroderma therapy (ECCS-50) in the EU. The EU regulatory environment is complicated, and our technology approach is novel. We cannot guarantee that the European Medicines Agencies and national competent authorities in the EU will grant regulatory approval for ECCS-50 on acceptable terms, if at all, nor can we guarantee that reimbursement agencies and other third party payers in the EU will grant us favorable reimbursement for our ECCS-50 product offering. These commercialization risks could affect prospective partners\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 willingness to enter into partnering arrangements on terms acceptable to us. See risk factors below for further discussion regarding regulatory and market risks associated with our products.\nTo the extent any of our customers fail to use our products in compliance with applicable regulations, regulators could try to hold us responsible if they believe we facilitated or were otherwise somehow responsible for our customer's non-compliance\nWe sell our products in many markets. Many of these markets have different, and in some cases less burdensome, regulatory schemes applicable to our products. To the extent any of our customers, whether inside or outside the U.S., use or further market our products for unapproved uses in their home market or in other markets or in a way that does not otherwise comply with applicable laws, there is a risk that regulators could try to hold us responsible for any such non-compliance. For example, we sell products to customers outside the U.S. To the extent any of our customers use or further market our products in their home market in a way that does not comply with applicable local regulations, regulators could try to hold us responsible if they believe we facilitated or were otherwise responsible for the customers actions. While we take measures in an effort to protect us against these types of risks, we cannot ensure you that such measures would prevent us from becoming subject to any such claims.\nMarket acceptance of new technology such as ours can be difficult to obtain\nNew and emerging cell therapy and cell banking technologies, such as those provided by the Cytori Cell Therapy family of products, may have difficulty or encounter significant delays in obtaining market acceptance in some or all countries around the world due to the novelty of our cell therapy and cell banking technologies. Therefore, the market adoption of our Cytori Cell Therapy and cell banking technologies may be slow and lengthy with no assurances that significant market adoption will be successful. The lack of market adoption or reduced or minimal market adoption of our cell therapy and cell banking technologies may have a significant impact on our ability to successfully sell our product(s) into a country or region.\nFuture clinical trial results may differ significantly from our expectations\nWhile we have proceeded incrementally with our previous clinical trials in an effort to gauge the risks of proceeding with larger and more expensive trials, such as in previous cardiac trials in Europe, and our ATHENA I and ATHENA II feasibility trial in heart failure due to ischemic heart disease, we cannot guarantee that we will not experience negative results in larger and much more expensive clinical trials than we have conducted to date. Poor results, unanticipated events or other complications in our clinical trials could result in substantial delays in commercialization, substantial negative effects on the perception of our products, and substantial additional costs. These risks are increased by our reliance on third parties in the performance of many of the clinical trial functions, including the clinical investigators, hospitals, CROs, and other third party service providers.\nOur product candidates may not receive regulatory approvals or their development may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory requirements or safety concerns\nClinical testing of our products is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and the failure or delay of a clinical trial can occur at any stage. Even if initial results of preclinical and nonclinical studies or clinical trial results are promising, we may obtain different results in subsequent trials or studies that fail to show the desired levels of safety and efficacy, or we may not obtain applicable regulatory approval for a variety of other reasons. Clinical trials for any of our products could be unsuccessful, which would delay or prohibit regulatory approval and commercialization of the product. In the United States and other jurisdictions, regulatory approval can be delayed, limited or not granted for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022 clinical results may not meet prescribed endpoints for the studies or otherwise provide sufficient data to support the efficacy of our products;\n\u2022 clinical and nonclinical test results may reveal side effects, adverse events or unexpected safety issues associated with the use of our products;\n\u2022 regulatory review may not find a product safe or effective enough to merit either continued testing or final approval;\n\u2022 regulatory review may not find that the data from preclinical testing and clinical trials justifies approval;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require that we change our studies or conduct additional studies which may significantly delay or make continued pursuit of approval commercially unattractive;\n\u2022 a regulatory agency may reject our trial data or disagree with our interpretations of either clinical trial data or applicable regulations;\n\u2022 the cost of clinical trials required for product approval may be greater than what we originally anticipate, and we may decide to not pursue regulatory approval for such a product;\n\u2022 a regulatory agency may identify problems or other deficiencies in our existing manufacturing processes or facilities, or the existing processes or facilities of our collaborators, our contract manufacturers or our raw material suppliers;\n\u2022 a regulatory agency may change its formal or informal approval requirements and policies, act contrary to previous guidance, adopt new regulations or raise new issues or concerns late in the approval process;\n\u2022 a product candidate may be approved only for indications that are narrow or under conditions that place the product at a competitive disadvantage, which may limit the sales and marketing activities for such products or otherwise adversely impact the commercial potential of a product; or\n\u2022 a regulatory agency may ask the company to put a clinical study on hold pending additional safety data; there is no guarantee that the company will be able to satisfy the regulator agencies requests in a timely manner, which can lead to significant uncertainty in the completion of a clinical study.\nIf a product is not approved in a timely fashion on commercially viable terms, or if development of any product is terminated due to difficulties or delays encountered in the regulatory approval process, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, and we will become more dependent on the development of other proprietary products and/or our ability to successfully acquire other products and technologies. There can be no assurances that any product will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner, or at all.\nCertain products will be marketed, and perhaps manufactured, in foreign countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals in foreign countries is subject to delay and failure for the reasons set forth above, as well as for reasons that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The approval process varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Foreign regulatory agencies may not provide approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA.\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary rights\nOur success depends in part on whether we can maintain our existing patents, obtain additional patents, maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties.\nThere can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will be approved or that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable. There is also no assurance that any patents issued to us will not become the subject of a re-examination, will provide us with competitive advantages, will not be challenged by any third parties, or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products, or design around our patents.\nOur commercial success will also depend, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing on patents issued by others. If we were judicially determined to be infringing on any third-party patent, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. If we are required in the future to obtain any licenses from third parties for some of our products, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to do so on commercially favorable terms, if at all. U.S. patent applications are not immediately made public, so we might be surprised by the grant to someone else of a patent on a technology we are actively using.\nLitigation, which would result in substantial costs to us and diversion of effort on our part, may be necessary to enforce or confirm the ownership of any patents issued or licensed to us, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. If our competitors claim technology also claimed by us and prepare and file patent applications in the United States, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Any such litigation or interference proceeding, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time-consuming.\nSuccessful challenges to our patents through oppositions, reexamination proceedings or interference proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties and it is determined that we infringe the patents of third-parties, we may be subject to litigation, or otherwise prevented from commercializing potential products in the relevant jurisdiction, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved in our favor, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain products, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOn September 16, 2011, President Obama signed into law major patent law reform known as the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA). Among other things the AIA implements a first inventor to file standard for patent approval, changes the legal standards for patentability under section 102 of the statute, and creates a post grant review system. As a result of the added uncertainty of interpretation of the AIA and the uncertainty of patent law in general, we cannot predict with certainty how much protection, if any, will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court. Changes to the patent law under the AIA also may provoke third parties to assert claims against us or result in our intellectual property being narrowed in scope or declared to be invalid or unenforceable.\nCompetitors or third parties may infringe on or upon our patents. We may be required to file patent infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or that the third party\u2019s technology does not in fact infringe upon our patents. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Litigation may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries outside the U.S. where patent rights may be more difficult to enforce. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition to patents, which alone may not be able to protect the fundamentals of our business, we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. Some of our intended future cell-related therapeutic products may fit into this category. We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our partners, employees, advisors, vendors, and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. There can be no guarantee that these agreements will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nFailure to obtain or maintain patent protection, or protect trade secrets, for any reason (or third-party claims against our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights, or our involvement in disputes over our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights, including involvement in litigation), could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside the United States\nIntellectual property law outside the United States is uncertain and in many countries is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries do not protect our patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. This is particularly relevant to us as most of our current commercial product sales and clinical trials are outside of the United States. Third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings. Opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the United States. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors\u2019 patents that have been issued in countries other than the U.S. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We currently have pending patent applications in Europe, Australia, Japan, Canada, China, Korea, and Brazil, among other countries.\nWe and our medical devices are subject to FDA regulation\nAs medical devices, the Celution\u00ae System family of products, and components of the Stemsource\u00ae cell banks, must receive regulatory clearances or approvals from the FDA and, in many instances, from non-U.S. and state governments prior to their sale. The Celution\u00ae System family of products is subject to stringent government regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA regulates the design/development process, clinical testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, sale, distribution, and promotion of medical devices and drugs. Included among these regulations are pre-market clearance and pre-market approval requirements, design control requirements, and the Quality System Regulations/Good Manufacturing Practices. Other statutory and regulatory requirements govern, among other things, establishment registration and inspection, medical device listing, prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration, labeling and post-market reporting.\nThe regulatory process can be lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Before any new medical device may be introduced to the U.S. market, the manufacturer generally must obtain FDA clearance or approval through either the 510(k) pre-market notification process or the lengthier pre-market approval application, or PMA, process. It generally takes from three to 12 months from submission to obtain 510(k) pre-market clearance, although it may take longer. Approval of a PMA could take four or more years from the time the process is initiated. The 510(k) and PMA processes can be expensive, uncertain, and lengthy, and there is no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval. Our Celution\u00ae products under development today and in the foreseeable future will be subject to the lengthier PMA process. Securing FDA clearances and approvals may require the submission of extensive clinical data and supporting information to the FDA, and there can be no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can result in application integrity proceedings, fines, recalls or seizures of products, injunctions, civil penalties, total or partial suspensions of production, withdrawals of existing product approvals or clearances, refusals to approve or clear new applications or notifications, and criminal prosecution.\nMedical devices are also subject to post-market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury, and for certain device malfunctions that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If safety or effectiveness problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may take steps to prevent or limit further marketing of the product. Additionally, the FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing and promotion of devices for indications or uses that have not been cleared or approved by the FDA. While we believe that our current activities are in compliance with FDA regulations relating to marketing and promotion, if regulators were to determine that our commercialization efforts, or those of our distributors, collaborators or customers, involve improper marketing and promotion of our products in violation of FDA regulations, our business could be substantially negatively affected.\nThere can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the necessary 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals to market and manufacture our other products in the United States for their intended use on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTo sell in international markets, we will be subject to regulation in foreign countries\nIn cooperation with our distribution and collaborative partners, we intend to market our current and future products both domestically and in many foreign markets. A number of risks are inherent in international transactions. In order for us to market our products in Europe, Canada, Japan and certain other non-U.S. jurisdictions, we need to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or clearances and must comply with extensive regulations regarding safety, manufacturing processes and quality. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearances to market, may differ from the FDA regulatory scheme. International sales also may be limited or disrupted by political instability, price controls, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. Additionally, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold.\nThere can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approvals or clearances in all of the countries where we intend to market our products, or that we will not incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or clearances, or that we will be able to successfully commercialize current or future products in various foreign markets. Delays in receipt of approvals or clearances to market our products in foreign countries, failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the future loss of previously received approvals or clearances could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanging, new and/or emerging government regulations may adversely affect us\nGovernment regulations can change without notice. Given the fact that Cytori operates in various international markets, our access to such markets could change with little to no warning due to a change in government regulations that suddenly up-regulate our product(s) and create greater regulatory burden for our cell therapy and cell banking technology products.\nDue to the fact that there are new and emerging cell therapy and cell banking regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence. Therefore, the level of complexity and stringency is not known and may vary from country to country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process.\nAnticipated or unanticipated changes in the way or manner in which the FDA or other regulators regulate products or classes/groups of products can delay, further burden, or alleviate regulatory pathways that were once available to other products. There are no guarantees that such changes in FDA\u2019s or other regulators\u2019 approach to the regulatory process will not deleteriously affect some or all of our products or product applications.\nWe may have difficulty obtaining health insurance reimbursement for our products\nNew and emerging cell therapy and cell banking technologies, such as those provided by the Cytori Cell Therapy family of products, may have difficulty or encounter significant delays in obtaining health care reimbursement in some or all countries around the world due to the novelty of our cell therapy and cell banking technology and subsequent lack of existing reimbursement schemes/pathways. Therefore, the creation of new reimbursement pathways may be complex and lengthy with no assurances that such reimbursements will be successful. The lack of health insurance reimbursement or reduced or minimal reimbursement pricing may have a significant impact on our ability to successfully sell our cell therapy and cell banking technology product(s) into a county or region, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nOur concentration of sales in Japan may have negative effects on our business in the event of any crisis in that region\nWe have operations in a number of regions around the world, including the United States, Japan, and Europe. Our global operations may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to operate our business. We sell our products globally, which exposes us to a number of risks that can arise from international trade transactions, local business practices and cultural considerations, including:\n\u00b7 political unrest, terrorism and economic or financial instability;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes and uncertainty in regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 nationalization programs that may be implemented by foreign governments;\n\u00b7 import-export regulations;\n\u00b7 difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables;\n\u00b7 difficulties in ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 changes in labor practices, including wage inflation, labor unrest and unionization policies;\n\u00b7 longer payment cycles by international customers;\n\u00b7 currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u00b7 disruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers, including electricity shortages;\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing foreign branches and subsidiaries and in managing an expatriate workforce, and differing employment practices and labor issues; and\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe also face risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings as a result of our foreign operations. We are also vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Although we have significant operations in Asia, a substantial portion of transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. As appreciation against the U.S. dollar increases, it will result in an increase in the cost of our business expenses abroad. Conversely, downward fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make our products less price competitive than local solutions. From time to time, we may engage in currency hedging activities, but such activities may not be able to limit the risks of currency fluctuations.\n*Our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in the amount of product ordered by any such customer\nOur largest customer accounted for 23% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015. Loss of this significant customer or a significant reduction in the amount of product ordered by this customer could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe must maintain quality assurance certification and manufacturing approvals\nThe manufacture of our products is, and the manufacture of any future cell-related therapeutic products would be, subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and distribution partners. The manufacture of devices and products for human use is subject to regulation and inspection from time to time by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, as well as equivalent requirements and inspections by state and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. There can be no guarantee that the FDA or other authorities will not, during the course of an inspection of existing or new facilities, identify what they consider to be deficiencies in our compliance with QSRs or other requirements and request, or seek remedial action.\nFailure to comply with such regulations or a potential delay in attaining compliance may adversely affect our manufacturing activities and could result in, among other things, injunctions, civil penalties, FDA refusal to grant pre-market approvals or clearances of future or pending product submissions, fines, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspensions of production, and criminal prosecution. There can be no assurance after such occurrences that we will be able to obtain additional necessary regulatory approvals or clearances on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals or clearances, or the loss of previously received approvals or clearances could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe termination or suspension of the BARDA contract could delay and/or adversely affect our business and our ability to further develop our Celution\u00ae System\nWe were awarded the contract with BARDA in September 2012 with the aim to develop a new countermeasure for a combined injury involving thermal burn and radiation exposure which would be useful following a mass-casualty event. The cost-plus-fixed-fee contract was valued at up to $106 million, with a guaranteed base period of approximately $4.7 million which included preclinical research and the acceleration of our ongoing development of the Celution\u00ae cell processing System (the Celution\u00ae System).\nOn August 13, 2014, we and BARDA amended the contract exercising Option 1 to perform research, regulatory, clinical and other tasks required for initiation of a pilot clinical trial of the Celution System in thermal burn injury, amended the Statement of Work and reorganized the contract options. The total cost plus fixed fee for the performance of Option 1 was up to approximately $12.1 million. In December 2014, we executed an amendment to the August 2014 contract option to fund continued investigation and development of Cytori Cell Therapy for use in thermal burn injuries , which increased the option extension to $14.1 million. The revised Option 2 consists of execution of the pilot clinical study, regulatory, and other tasks for a cost plus fixed fee of up to $8.3 million. The revised Option 3 consists of clinical, regulatory, and other tasks for completion of a pivotal clinical trial leading to FDA approval for use of the Celution System in thermal burn injury, for a cost plus fixed fee of up to $45.5 million. The revised Option 4 consists of R&D, clinical, regulatory and other tasks required to develop and obtain FDA clearance for other characteristics suitable for use in thermal burn injury following a mass casualty event, for a cost plus fixed fee of up to $23.4 million.\nBARDA may suspend or terminate this contract should we fail to achieve key objectives or milestones, or fail to comply with the operating procedures and processes approved by BARDA and its audit agency, the Defense Contract Audit Agency. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with BARDA\u2019s operating procedures and processes, achieve the necessary clinical milestones, or whether we will be able to successfully develop our Celution\u00ae System under the contract. If the BARDA contract were terminated or suspended, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe BARDA contract has certain contracting requirements that allow the U.S. Government to unilaterally control its contracts. If the U.S. Government suspends, cancels, or otherwise terminates our contract with them, we could experience significant revenue shortfalls, and our financial condition and business may be adversely affected\nContracts with U.S. Government agencies typically contain termination provisions unfavorable to the other party, and are subject to audit and modification by the U.S. Government at its sole discretion, which will subject us to additional risks. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally:\n\u00b7 audit or object to our contract-related costs and fees, and require us to reimburse all such costs and fees;\n\u00b7 suspend or prevent us for a set period of time from receiving new contracts or extending our existing contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;\n\u00b7 cancel, terminate or suspend our contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;\n\u00b7 terminate our contracts if in the Government\u2019s best interest, including if funds become unavailable to the applicable governmental agency;\n\u00b7 reduce the scope and value of our contracts; and\n\u00b7 change certain terms and conditions in our contracts.\nBARDA is able to terminate its contracts with us, either for its best interests or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with or to achieve the milestones set forth in the contract schedules and terms. Termination-for-convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed and settlement expenses on the work completed prior to termination. Changes to, or an unexpected termination of this contract could result in significant revenue shortfalls. If revenue shortfalls occur and are not offset by corresponding reductions in expenses, our business could be adversely affected. We cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent BARDA might revise, alter or terminate its contract with us in the future.\nUnder our contract with BARDA, our operations, and those of our contractors, are subject to audit by the U.S. Government, a negative outcome to which could adversely affect our financial conditions and business operations\nU.S. Government agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or the DCAA, routinely audit and investigate government contractors and recipients of federal grants. These agencies evaluate a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards.\nThe DHHS and the DCAA also review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must generally be repaid. If an audit identifies improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 termination of contracts;\n\u00b7 forfeiture of profits;\n\u00b7 suspension of payments;\n\u00b7 fines; and\n\u00b7 suspension or prohibition from conducting business with the U.S. Government.\nMaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting have occurred in the past and could occur in the future\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2013, which may have adversely affected investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. While no such material weakness was identified for the years ended December 31, 2014 or December 31, 2015, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIf we are unable to effectively remediate any material weaknesses in a timely manner, or if we identify one or more additional material weaknesses in the future, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe depend on a few key officers\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and other key scientific and sales staff, including Marc H. Hedrick, MD, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We rely upon them for strategic business decisions and guidance. We believe that our future success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend in large part upon whether we can attract and retain additional qualified management and scientific personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key scientific staff, or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel and develop expertise as needed could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not have enough product liability insurance\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of our regenerative cell products involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us, our distribution partners, or licensees. There can be no guarantee that our clinical trial and commercial product liability insurance is adequate or will continue to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost, if at all. A product liability claim, product recall, or other claim, as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Also, well-publicized claims could cause our stock to fall sharply, even before the merits of the claims are decided by a court.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\n*The market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders and subject us to litigation\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, including:\n\u00b7 fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 variance in our financial performance from the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u00b7 changes in the estimates of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n\u00b7 changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;\n\u00b7 conditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u00b7 changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u00b7 success of competitive products and services;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 the outcome of clinical trials involving the use of our products, including our sponsored trials;\n\u00b7 our continuing ability to list our securities on an established market or exchange;\n\u00b7 the timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and approvals of our products;\n\u00b7 the commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u00b7 changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u00b7 actual or expected sales of our common stock by the holders of our common stock; and\n\u00b7 the trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, the NASDAQ markets and the market for cell therapy development companies in particular may experience a loss of investor confidence. A loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, our financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class-action litigation. Class-action litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\n*Future sales of our common stock may depress our share price\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 195,058,395 shares of our common stock outstanding. Sales of a number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the expectation of such sales, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may also sell additional common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in subsequent public or private offerings or other transactions, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have granted demand registration rights for the resale of certain shares of our common stock to each of Astellas Pharma Inc. and Green Hospital Supply, Inc. pursuant to common stock purchase agreements previously entered into with each of these stockholders. An aggregate of 4,428,571 shares of our common stock are subject to these demand registration rights. If we receive a written request from any of these stockholders to file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering its shares of unregistered common stock, we are required to use reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC within 30 business days of such request a registration statement covering the resale of the shares for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act.\nOur charter documents contain anti-takeover provisions\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions could also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our Board of Directors. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions:\n\u2022 authorize our Board of Directors to issue without stockholder approval up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022 require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and cannot be taken by written consent;\n\u2022 establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our Board of Directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022 limit who may call stockholder meetings.\nWe are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on our common stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nWe pay no dividends in connection with our common stock\nWe have never paid cash dividends in the past, and currently do not intend to pay any cash dividends in connection with our common stock in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, our Loan Agreement with the Lender currently prohibits our issuance of cash dividends. This could make an investment in our company inappropriate for some investors, and may serve to narrow our potential sources of additional capital.\nIf securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 91021, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PSTV"}
