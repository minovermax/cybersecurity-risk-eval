{"cik": "1069183", "company": "AXON ENTERPRISE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate our results or trends in future periods. You should carefully consider the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nWe are materially dependent on acceptance of our products by law enforcement markets, both domestic and international. If law enforcement agencies do not continue to purchase and use our products, our revenues will be adversely affected.\nAt any point, due to external factors and opinions, whether or not related to product performance, law enforcement agencies may elect to no longer purchase our CEDs or other products.\nWe substantially depend on sales of our TASER CEDs, and if these products do not continue to be widely accepted, our growth prospects will be diminished.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we derived a significant portion of our revenues from sales of TASER CED brand devices and related cartridges, and expect to depend on sales of these products for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. A decrease in the selling prices of, or demand for these products, or their failure to maintain broad market acceptance, would significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to design, introduce, sell and deploy new products or new product features successfully, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new products or new product features that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. These products include, but are not limited to, Axon Body 3, Axon Aware, Axon Records, Axon Dispatch, and future generations of the TASER CED and Axon Fleet. The development of new products and new product features is complex, time consuming and expensive, and we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. We may choose to carry higher level of inventories to mitigate the risk of production delays, which may in turn expose us to an increased risk of obsolescence.\nWe are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based productivity and communication software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") solutions, which we intend to broadly deploy to a large number of customers. Customer requirements for these products are complex and varied. If we are unable to develop scalable solutions that can consistently be configured for customers with minimal effort, or if we are unable to build out a professional services team that can consistently configure our products to meet the requirements of large numbers of customers in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to broadly scale our cloud-based productivity and communication SaaS solutions could be negatively impacted, and our deployment costs could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that products that we may develop in the future will achieve market acceptance. If we fail to develop new products or new product features on a timely basis that achieve market acceptance, our business, financial results and competitive position could be adversely affected.\nDelays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues and cash flows.\nThe development of CEDs, devices, sensors and software is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Our focus on our SaaS platform also presents complex development issues. Significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.\nWe face risks associated with rapid technological change and new competing products.\nThe technology associated with law enforcement devices is receiving significant attention and is rapidly evolving. While we have some patent protection in certain key areas of our CED, Axon Device and SaaS technology, it is possible that new technology may result in competing products that operate outside our patents and could present significant competition for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.\nHigher costs or unavailability of materials could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe depend on certain domestic and international suppliers for the delivery of components used in the assembly of our products. Our reliance on third-party suppliers creates risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or sub-assemblies and reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components and sub-assemblies. Specifically, we depend on suppliers of sub-assemblies, machined parts, injection molded plastic parts, printed circuit boards, custom wire fabrications and other miscellaneous customer parts for our products. We do not have any significant long-term agreements with any of our suppliers and there is no guarantee that supply will not be interrupted.\nSingle or sole-source components used in the manufacture of our products may become unavailable or discontinued. Delays caused by industry allocations or obsolescence may take weeks or months to resolve. In some cases, parts obsolescence may require a product re-design to ensure quality replacement components. These delays could cause significant delays in manufacturing and loss of sales, leading to adverse effects significantly impacting our financial condition or results of operations and could injure our reputation.\nA significant number of our raw materials or components are comprised of petroleum-based products or incur some form of landed cost associated with transporting the raw materials or components to our facility. Our freight and import costs and the timely delivery of our products could be adversely impacted by a number of factors which could reduce the profitability of our operations, including: higher fuel costs; potential port closures; customs clearance issues; increased government regulation or changes for imports of foreign products into the U.S.; delays created by terrorist attacks or threats, public health issues, national disasters or work stoppages; and other matters. Any interruption of supply for any material components of our products could significantly delay the shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and financial condition. International or domestic geopolitical or other events, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials or components, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials or components, and could adversely impact the profitability of our operations.\nTo the extent demand for our products increases, our future success will be dependent upon our ability to manage our growth and to increase manufacturing production capacity, which may be accomplished by the implementation of customized manufacturing automation equipment.\nTo the extent demand for our products increases significantly in future periods, one of our key challenges will be to increase our production capacity to meet sales demand while maintaining product quality. Our primary strategies to accomplish this include introducing additional shifts, increasing the physical size of our assembly facilities, the hiring of additional production staff, and the implementation of additional customized automation equipment. The investments we make in this equipment may not yield the anticipated labor and material efficiencies. Our inability to meet any future increase in sales demand or effectively manage our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial results and financial condition.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to expand sales through distributors and direct sales and our inability to recruit new distributors or increase direct sales would negatively affect our sales.\nOur distribution strategy is to pursue sales through multiple channels with an emphasis on independent distributors and direct sales. Our inability to establish relationships with and retain law enforcement equipment distributors, who we believe can successfully sell our products, would adversely affect our sales. In addition, our arrangements with our distributors are generally short-term. We are also focusing on direct sales to larger agencies through our regional sales managers and our inability to grow sales to these agencies in this manner could adversely affect our sales. If we do not competitively price our products, meet the requirements of our distributors or end-users, provide adequate marketing support, or comply with the terms of our distribution arrangements, our distributors may fail to aggressively market our products or may terminate their relationships with us. These developments would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales. Our reliance on the sales of our products by others also makes it more difficult to predict our revenues, cash flow and operating results.\nThe increased focus on direct sales compared to sales through distribution is dependent on our ability to sell into the states or foreign jurisdictions that have established distributor relationships.\nIn certain states and foreign jurisdictions we have decided to pursue sales directly with law enforcement customers, rather than working through established distribution channels. Our customers may have strong working relationships with distributors and we may face resistance to this change. If we do not overcome this resistance and effectively build a direct relationship with our customers, sales may be adversely affected.\nWe expend significant resources in anticipation of a sale due to our lengthy sales cycle and may receive no revenue in return.\nGenerally, law enforcement and corrections agencies consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products, including product benefits, training costs, the cost to use our products in addition to, or in place of, other products, budget constraints and product reliability, safety and efficacy. The length of our sales cycle may range from a few weeks to as long as several years. Adverse publicity surrounding our products or the safety of such products has in the past, and could in the future, lengthen our sales cycle with customers. In the past, we believe that our sales were adversely impacted by negative publicity surrounding our products or the use of our products. See, for example, \u201cLitigation - Product Litigation\u201d in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant effort in connection with the evaluation of our products by potential customers before they place an order. If these potential customers do not purchase our products, we will have expended significant resources and received no revenue in return.\nAn increasing percentage of our revenue is derived from subscription billing arrangements which may result in delayed cash collections and may increase customer credit risk on receivables and contract assets.\nA growing portion of our sales are derived from subscription billing arrangements and on an open credit basis. While we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, if we become aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe may experience a decline in gross margins due to a shift in product sales from CEDs to software and sensors products and services which may continue to carry a lower gross margin.\nWe continue to invest in the growth of the Software and Sensors segment, and this expected growth may result in a higher percentage of total revenues being comprised of Software and Sensors products and services. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the Software and Sensors segment is currently lower than that of the TASER segment, and may continue to be lower in the future.\nSaaS revenue for Axon Evidence is recognized over the terms of the contracts, which may be several years, and, as such, trends in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nOur SaaS service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts, which generally range from one to five years. As a result, most of the SaaS revenue we report each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, current positive or negative trends in this portion of our business may not be fully reflected in our revenue results for several periods.\nMost of our end-user customers are subject to budgetary and political constraints that may delay or prevent sales.\nMost of our end-user customers are government agencies. These agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore, have limited control over the amount of money they can spend. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. As a result, even if an agency wants to acquire our products, it may be unable to purchase them due to budgetary or political constraints, particularly in challenging economic environments. There can be no assurance that the economic and budgeting issues will not worsen and adversely impact sales of our products. Some government agency orders may also be canceled or substantially delayed due to budgetary, political or other scheduling delays, which frequently occur in connection with the acquisition of products by such agencies, and such cancellations may accelerate or be more severe than we have experienced historically.\nDue to municipal government funding rules, certain of our contracts are subject to appropriation, termination for convenience, or similar cancellation clauses, which could allow our customers to cancel or not exercise options to renew contracts in the future.\nAlthough we have entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipate the contracts will be completed, if agencies do not appropriate money in future year budgets, terminate contracts for convenience or if other cancellation clauses are invoked, revenue and cash associated with these bookings will not ultimately be recognized, and could result in a reduction to bookings and revenue.\nChanges in civil forfeiture laws may affect our customers\u2019 ability to purchase our products.\nSome of our customers use funds seized through civil forfeiture proceedings to fund the purchase of our products. Legislative changes could impact our customers\u2019 ability to seize funds or use seized funds to fund purchases. Changes in civil forfeiture statutes or regulations are outside of our control and could limit the amount of funds available to our customers, which could adversely affect the sale of our products.\nIf our security measures or those of our third-party cloud storage providers are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to customers\u2019 data or our data, our network, data centers and service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur service involves the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of information or the total or partial deletion or encryption of all stored customer data, litigation and possible liability. We devote significant resources to engineer secure products and ensure security vulnerabilities are mitigated, and we require our third-party service providers to do so as well. Despite these efforts, security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, and malfeasance or otherwise. Breaches could occur during transfer of data to data centers or at any time, and result in unauthorized access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Additionally, hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack or gain access to our networks and data centers.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, grow more complex over time, and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Moreover, our security measures and those of our third-party service providers or customers may not detect such security breaches if they occur. Although we have\ndeveloped systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure that such measures will provide absolute security, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks.\nA security breach could expose us to a risk of loss or inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, or the denial of access to this data. A security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, disrupt our business, damage our reputation, lead to legal liability, negatively impact our future sales and significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nDefects or disruptions in our services could impact demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.\nWe currently serve our Axon Evidence customers from third-party cloud storage providers based in the U.S. and other countries. Interruptions in our service, or loss or corruption of digital evidence, may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.\nSince our customers use our services for important aspects of their operations, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 operations. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our warranty expense, an increase in collection cycles for and decline in the collectability of accounts receivable, and an increase in the expense and risk of litigation.\nDefects in our products could reduce demand for our products and result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance and damage to our reputation.\nComplex components and assemblies used in our products may contain undetected defects that are subsequently discovered at any point in the life of the product. Defects in our products could result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation and increased warranty costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.\nA variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, labor and employment, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices.\nThe costs of compliance with these laws and regulation are high and are likely to increase in the future. Additionally, these laws and regulations, or any associated inquiries or investigations or other government actions, may delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nTASER and Axon devices\nFor our TASER products, we rely on the opinions of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, including the determination that a device that has projectiles propelled by the release of compressed gas in place of the expanding gases from ignited gunpowder is not classified as a firearm. Changes in statutes, regulations, and interpretation outside of our control may result in our products being classified or reclassified as firearms. If this were to occur, our private citizen market could be substantially reduced because consumers would be required to comply with federal, state, or local firearm transfer requirements prior to purchasing our products.\nFederal regulation of sales in the U.S.: Our CEDs are not firearms regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, but our consumer products are regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Although there are currently no federal laws restricting sales of our core CED products in the U.S., future federal regulation could adversely affect sales of our products.\nAxon devices using lithium batteries are subject to US-DOT/UN 38.3 for transportation, and all our products containing hazardous chemicals require an additional safety data sheet following Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") recommendation.\nOur CED products are also subject to regulation by testing, safety and other standard organizations such as the American National Standards Institute, the International Electrotechnical Commission (\"IEC\"), the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Underwriters Laboratories (\"UL\"). We follow IEC 62133 for our rechargeable battery packs, UL 1642 for cells, and IEC 60950 (soon to be replaced by IEC 62368) for our wireless and docks devices. These regulations also affect CEDs with Axon signal technology, including signal performance power magazine technology, TASER 7 battery packs and could impact future CEDs that feature wireless technology. Compliance with government regulations could increase our operations and product costs and impact our future financial results.\nFederal regulation of international sales: Our CEDs are considered a \u201ccrime control\u201d product by the U.S. Department of Commerce (\u201cDOC\u201d) for export directly from the U.S. Consequently, we must obtain an export license from the DOC for the export of our CED devices from the U.S. other than to Canada. In addition, certain of our camera and software products require classifications from the DOC before they may be shipped internationally. Our inability to obtain DOC export licenses or classifications on a timely basis for sales of our products to our international customers could significantly and adversely affect our international sales.\nState and local regulation: Our CEDs are controlled, restricted or, less frequently, prohibited by a number of state and local governments. As of December 31, 2019, the possession of stun guns by the general public, including our CEDs, is prohibited in Hawaii and Rhode Island. Some cities and municipalities also prohibit private citizen possession or use of our CED products. Other jurisdictions may ban or restrict the sale of our CED products and our product sales may be significantly affected by additional state, county and city governmental regulation.\nInternational regulation: Certain jurisdictions prohibit, restrict, or require a permit for the importation, sale, possession or use of CEDs, including in some countries by law enforcement agencies, limiting our international sales opportunities.\nRadio spectrum devices\nCertain of our products utilize the radio spectrum to provide wireless voice, data and video communications services. The allocation of spectrum is regulated in the U.S. and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) regulates spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities. Similarly, countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of radio spectrum and electromagnetic interference, pursuant to their respective national laws. We manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies. Consequently, our results could be negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC or regulatory agencies in other countries. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed. If current products do not comply with the regulations set forth by these governing bodies, we may be unable to sell our products or could incur penalties, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAxon body worn cameras, docks, fleet vehicle cameras and signal devices are subject to FCC\u2019s rules and regulations. The FCC regulates not only the \"intentional radiation\" of radio transmitters, but also the \"unintentional radiation\" of noise from all sorts of electrical equipment. The FCC regulations appear in title 47 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations (47CFR).The current Axon products use Bluetooth, WiFi and/or LTE radio technologies. With the integration of LTE technologies, it is required to apply for the approval of private certifications such as CTIA, required by FirstNet and other operators. These regulations are also beginning to affect CEDs with signal performance power magazine technology and future CEDs implementing wireless technology into the feature set. Compliance with government regulations could increase our operations and product costs and impact our future financial results.\nEnvironmental regulations\nWe are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain substances in our products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of such products. In particular, environmental legislation within the European Union (\"EU\") may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our revenues from EU countries as we comply with and implement these requirements.\nThe EU has published Directives on the restriction of certain hazardous substances in electronic and electrical equipment (the \u201cRoHS Directive\u201d) and on electronic and electrical waste management (the \u201cWEEE Directive\u201d). The RoHS Directive restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead. The WEEE Directive directs members of the EU to enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the EU. In addition, similar environmental legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including the U.S. (under federal and state laws) and other countries, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.\nIn addition, the EU has defined a regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (the \u201cREACH Regulation\u201d) that places responsibility on industry to manage the risks from chemicals contained in products and to provide safety information about such substances. Manufacturers and importers are required to gather information on the properties of the chemical substances in their products, which will allow their safe handling. Starting January 5, 2021, companies supplying products containing substances of very high concern as identified by the EU on the EU market have to submit information on these products to the European Chemicals Agency. The information in their database is then made available to waste operators and consumers.\nWe continue to monitor the impact of specific registration and compliance activities required by the RoHS, WEEE Directives, and REACH Regulation. We endeavor to comply with applicable environmental laws, yet compliance with such laws could increase our operations and product costs, increase the complexities of product design, procurement, and manufacturing, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, limit our sales activities, and impact our future financial results. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties, and prohibiting sales of our products into one or more states or countries, and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nPrivacy regulations\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the EU and the U.S. agreed to an alternative transfer framework for data transferred from the EU to the U.S., called the Privacy Shield, but this new framework is subject to an annual review that could result in changes to our obligations and also may be challenged by national regulators or private parties. If one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from the EU to the U.S. is invalidated, if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.\nProposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the European General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products\nand services that provide service in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the EU that are different than those previously in place in the EU. In addition, the GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the U.S., at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\nWe may face personal injury, wrongful death and other liability claims that harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales and financial condition.\nOur CED products are often used in aggressive confrontations that may result in serious, permanent bodily injury or death to those involved. Our CED products may be associated with these injuries. A person, or the family members of a person, injured in a confrontation or otherwise in connection with the use of our products, may bring legal action against us to recover damages on the basis of theories including wrongful death, personal injury, negligent design, defective product or inadequate warning. We are currently subject to a number of such lawsuits and we have been subject to significant adverse judgments and settlements. We may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our products. If successful, wrongful death, personal injury, misuse and other claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could result in negative publicity about our products. We incur significant legal expenses in defending these cases, and significant litigation could also result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, negative publicity and a potential award of monetary damages in excess of our insurance coverage. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that our existing or any future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOther litigation may subject us to significant litigation costs and judgments and divert management attention from our business.\nWe have been or could in the future be involved in numerous other litigation matters relating to our products, contracts and business relationships, including litigation against persons whom we believe have infringed on our intellectual property, infringement litigation filed against us, litigation against a competitor, enforcement actions filed against us, and litigation involving the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). Such matters have resulted, and are expected to continue to result in, substantial costs to us, including in the form of attorneys' fees and costs, damages, fines or other penalties, whether pursuant to a judgment or settlement, and diversion of our management\u2019s attention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. There is also a risk of adverse judgments, as the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.\nWe have been, and may be in the future, subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims, which could incur substantial litigation costs, result in significant damage awards, inhibit our use of certain technologies, and divert management attention from our business.\nMany companies own intellectual property rights that are directly or indirectly related to public safety technologies. These companies periodically demand licensing agreements or engage in litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of their patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets. Non-practicing entities also have patents they have been granted or otherwise acquired, including patents that are directly or indirectly related to public safety technologies. These entities may seek compensation for perceived infringement of their patents, including by filing claims against us, independent of the merit of any such claims. As we enter new markets, expand into new product categories, and otherwise offer new products, services, and technologies, additional intellectual property claims may be filed against us by these companies, entities, and other third parties. Additional intellectual property claims may also be filed against us as our current products, services, and technologies gain additional market share.\nCurrently, we are a defendant in a patent litigation matter filed by Digital Ally Inc. (\u201cDigital\u201d) in the District of Kansas alleging patent infringement regarding our Axon Signal technology. For additional discussion of this matter, refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK. We believe the patent in question is both invalid and not infringed. However, if Digital ultimately succeeds in their appeal, the outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability is recognized and on our cash flows for the period in which any damages are paid.\nIf our products, services, or technologies were found to infringe a third-party\u2019s proprietary rights, we could be forced to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements in order to be able to sell our products or discontinue use of the protected technology. Such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We could also be required to pay substantial damages, fines or other penalties, indemnify customers or distributors, cease the manufacture, use, or sale of infringing products or processes, and/or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies. Our suppliers may not provide, or we may not be able to obtain, intellectual property indemnification sufficient to offset all damages, fines or other penalties resulting from any claims of intellectual property infringement brought against us or our customers. There is no guarantee that our use of conventional technology searching and brand clearance searching will identify all potential rights holders. Rights holders may demand payment for past infringements and/or force us to accept costly license terms or discontinue use of protected technology and/or works of authorship that may include, for example, photos, videos, and software. Our current research and development focus on developing software-based products, including that which is related to artificial intelligence, increases this risk.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and products may decrease and we may lose our competitive market advantage.\nOur future success depends upon our proprietary technology. Our protective measures for this proprietary technology include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret protection. However, these protective measures, as well as our efforts to pursue such protective measures, may prove inadequate. For example, the value of intellectual property protection in certain countries may not be apparent until after such protection can no longer be pursued. As such, our intellectual property protection may not extend to all countries in which our products are distributed or will be distributed in the future. Though we work to protect our innovations, we may not be able to obtain protection for certain innovations. For example, we may be unable to patent some software-based products. The scope of any patent protection we have obtained, or may obtain, may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products. Despite our efforts, any intellectual property protection we obtain may be later determined to be insufficient or ineffective.\nOur protective measures may prove inadequate for reasons outside of our control. Different intellectual property laws between different countries may lead to differences in protection between such countries. In certain countries in which our products are distributed, the ability to effectively enforce intellectual property rights may not exist. Patent requirements differ by country and certain domestic or foreign laws may prohibit us from satisfying these requirements, creating a risk that some of our international patents may become unenforceable. Patents for older technologies, such as our M26 model of CEDs, have expired or will expire due to statutory limits on patent term. Despite policies and efforts to maintain secrecy, trade secrets and other confidential information we maintain, or may choose to maintain in the future, could be compromised by employees, partners, or other third parties.\nOnce established, there is no guarantee that our intellectual property rights will remain in force. Issued patents may be re-examined and subsequently ruled invalid or unenforceable. Our registered trademarks may also be diminished or lost. For example, there is a risk that our \u201cTASER\u201d trademark could become synonymous with the general product category of \u201cconducted energy devices\u201d. The right to stop others from misusing our trademarks and service marks in commerce depends, to some extent, on our ability to show evidence of enforcement of our rights against such misuse in commerce. Our efforts to stop improper use, if insufficient, may lead to loss of trademark and service mark rights, brand loyalty and notoriety among our customers and prospective customers.\nOur intellectual property may also be at risk if we are unable to defend from enforcement actions, such as that filed by the FTC against us regarding our acquisition of Vievu LLC from Safariland LLC on May 3, 2018. For additional discussion of this matter, refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If successful, the FTC is seeking a divestiture of Vievu along with Axon assets sufficient to stand up a viable competitor.\nInability to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our commercial efforts and competitive market advantage. Regardless of outcome, the prosecution of patent and other intellectual property claims is both costly and time consuming. Unauthorized use of our proprietary technology could divert our management\u2019s attention from our business, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nInternationally, we can enforce patent rights only in the jurisdictions in which our patent applications have been granted.\nOur U.S. patents protect us from imported infringing products coming into the U.S. from abroad. We have made applications for patents in a few foreign countries; however, these may be inadequate to protect markets for our products in other foreign countries. Each patent is examined and granted according to the law of the country where it was filed independent of whether a U.S. patent on similar technology was granted. A patent in a foreign country may be subject to cancellation if the claimed invention has not been sold in that country. Meeting the requirements of working invention differs by country and ranges from sales in the country to manufacturing in the country. U.S. export law, or the laws of some foreign countries, may prohibit us from satisfying the requirements for working the invention, creating a risk that some of our international patents may become unenforceable.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur international operations are significant, and we plan to continue to grow internationally by acquiring existing entities or setting up new legal entities in new markets. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nRestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.\n\u2022\nImport and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market or obtaining necessary parts and components to manufacture products, which may lead to decreased sales and may increase our operating costs.\n\u2022\nLonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.\n\u2022\nUncertainty regarding liability for our products and services, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.\n\u2022\nDifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of workers' councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, changes in international local political, economic, regulatory, tax, social, and labor conditions may adversely harm our business and compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, among others, environmental regulations, internal control and disclosure rules, privacy and data protection requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and competition regulations, among others.\nOur business in the United Kingdom may be negatively impacted by uncertainty regarding the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU (commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"). The exit itself could negatively impact the United Kingdom and other economies, which could adversely affect sales of our products and services. We may also experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling, the euro and other European currencies. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and the EU, and we may incur additional costs or need to make operational changes as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international growth efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and other strategic investments may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may consider additional acquisitions, joint ventures, or other strategic investments as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, expected synergies are not achieved, we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, we experience difficulty in the integration or coordination of new employees, business systems, and technology, we incur unanticipated liabilities, or there is a diversion of management\u2019s attention from our other businesses. These events could harm our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. Events which might indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, declines in stock price market capitalization or cash flows, adverse cost factors, deteriorating financial performance, strategic decisions made in response to economic, market and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on us and our customer base, and/or relevant events such as changes in management, key personnel, litigation or customers.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nA disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, fire, explosion, failure to contain hazardous materials, industrial accident, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, public health crisis, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results as well as expose us to claims, litigation and governmental investigations and fines.\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China. Following the outbreak of this virus, the Chinese government has quarantined certain affected regions and certain travel restrictions have been imposed. These events have had and could continue to have an impact on our supply chain. At the time of this filing, the outbreak has been largely concentrated in China, although a growing number of cases have been confirmed in other countries. If our backup and mitigation plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.\nFor current and potential international customers whose contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, the relative change in local currency values creates relative fluctuations in our product pricing. These changes in international end-user costs may result in lost orders and reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain foreign markets.\nAdditionally, intercompany sales to our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international subsidiaries are transacted in U.S. dollars which could increase our foreign exchange rate risk caused by foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nFor non-U.S. dollar denominated sales, weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar generally leads us to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for our products. Should we decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar\u2019s strengthening, the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings would be adversely affected. We do not currently engage in hedging activities. Fluctuations in foreign currency could result in a change in the U.S. dollar value of our foreign denominated assets and liabilities including accounts receivable. Therefore, the U.S. dollar equivalent collected on a given sale could be less than the amount invoiced causing the sale to be less profitable than contemplated.\nWe also import selected components which are used in the manufacturing of some of our products. Although our purchase orders are generally in U.S. dollars, weakness in the U.S. dollar could lead to price increases for the components.\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, and changes in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nWe are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nOur tax provision could also be impacted by changes in federal, state or international tax laws including fundamental tax law changes applicable to corporate multinationals.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period.\nThe enactment of tax reform legislation, including legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nLegislation or other changes in the tax laws could increase our liability and adversely affect our after-tax profitability. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") was enacted in the United States on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act had a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenses and net deferred tax assets. The Tax Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate, eliminated or limited deduction of several expenses which were previously deductible, imposed a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries, required a minimum tax on earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries and permitted a tax-free repatriation of foreign earnings through a dividends received deduction.\nWe maintain most of our cash balances, some of which are not insured, at four depository institutions.\nWe maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents accounts at four depository institutions. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate balances in such accounts were $161.8 million. Our balances with these institutions regularly exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insured limits for domestic deposits and various foreign deposit insurance programs covering our deposits in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.\nWe could suffer losses with respect to the uninsured balances if the depository institutions failed and the institution\u2019s assets were insufficient to cover its deposits and/or the governments did not take actions to support deposits in excess of existing insurance limits. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain our key management, sales and technical personnel.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our key management personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified technical employees. Although we have employment agreements with our officers and other members of our executive management team, the employment of such persons is \u201cat-will\u201d and either we or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any time, subject to the applicable terms of the employment agreements. The competition for our key employees is intense. The loss of the service of one or more of our key personnel could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Patrick W. Smith, our Chief Executive Officer.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Patrick W. Smith, our founder and Chief Executive Officer. Our future success depends upon our ability to retain executive officers, specifically Mr. Smith, and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nStock compensation expense may have a material, unpredictable impact on our results of operations.\nWe have historically granted and expect to continue to grant stock-based compensation to key employees and non-employee directors as a means of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. All stock-based awards are required to be recognized in our financial statements based on their grant date fair values. The amount recognized for stock compensation expense could vary depending on a number of assumptions or changes that may occur.\nFor awards containing multiple service, performance and market conditions, where all conditions must be satisfied prior to vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period, based on management\u2019s estimate of the probability and timing of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date. Changes in the subjective and probability-based assumptions can materially affect the estimates of the fair value of the awards and timing of recognition of stock-based compensation expense and consequently, the related amount recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nIf we achieve specific operational goals and the covered employees complete the requisite service conditions for the performance-based awards with multiple service, performance, and market conditions, including our CEO Performance Award and our eXponential Stock Performance Plan (\"XSPP\"), we will recognize stock compensation expense regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved and the underlying tranches vest.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or estimates by third-parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, addressable market or the effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in operation performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industries, including our developers and competitors;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in anticipated or new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulator actions, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial or regulatory bodies; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter-to-quarter, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to various factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nbudgetary cycles of municipal, state and federal law enforcement and corrections agencies;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe timing of large domestic and international orders;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of any existing or future litigation;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity surrounding our products, the safety of our products, or the use of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in our sales mix;\n\u2022\nnew product introduction costs;\n\u2022\nincreased raw material expenses;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating expenses, including stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates and\n\u2022\nregulatory changes that may affect the marketability of our products.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful in the short term, and our performance in a particular period may not be indicative of our performance in any future period.", "PERMNO": 89031, "SIC": 3480, "TIC": "AAXN"}
