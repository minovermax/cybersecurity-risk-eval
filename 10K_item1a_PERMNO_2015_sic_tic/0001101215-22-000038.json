The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nSummary\nThis risk factor summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete description of our risk factors set forth immediately below.\nRisks related to our strategic, business and competitive environment include:\n\u25cf The impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures;\n\u25cf Our ten largest partners represented over half of our consolidated Total net interest and non-interest income (revenue) in 2021, and a decrease in business from, or the loss of, any of these partners, could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf Our business is heavily concentrated in U.S. consumer credit, and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in the U.S. consumer credit market than a more diversified company.\n\u25cf The amount of our Allowance for credit losses could adversely affect our business and may be insufficient to cover actual losses on our loans.\n\u25cf Competition in our industry is intense.\n\u25cf Our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners, and our results are impacted, to a significant extent, on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our partners and on the financial performance of our partners.\n\u25cf We rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business, and if they are not accurate or are misinterpreted, such factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u25cf Underwriting performance of acquired or new lending programs may not be consistent with existing experience.\n\u25cf Unsecured consumer and business lending leads to losses from bankruptcies and inability to collect from borrowers.\nRisks related to our liquidity, market and credit risk include:\n\u25cf Adverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and ability to meet our debt service requirements and other obligations.\n\u25cf Our inability to effectively access the securitization or other capital markets could limit our funding opportunities for loans and other business opportunities.\n\u25cf Competition for deposits and regulatory restrictions on deposit products can impact availability and cost of funds.\n\u25cf Our level of indebtedness may restrict our ability to compete and grow our business.\n\u25cf Our market valuation has been volatile, and returns to stockholders have been impacted by a lower dividend rate, cessation of share repurchase programs and issuance of shares for acquisitions.\n\u25cf We are a holding company and depend on dividends and other payments from our Banks, which are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions.\nRisks related to our legal, regulatory and compliance environment include:\n\u25cf We face various risks related to the comprehensive government regulation and supervision of our business, including by the FDIC and other federal and state authorities.\n\u25cf Legislation, regulatory matters and litigation may have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf Regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\n\u25cf Financial institution capital requirements may limit cash available for business operations, growth and returns to stockholders.\nRisks related to cybersecurity, technology and third-party vendors include:\n\u25cf Reliance on third-party vendors and current efforts to transition to multiple strategic outsourcing partners may result in service failures outside our control.\n\u25cf Failures in data protection, cybersecurity and information security, as well as business interruptions to our data centers and other systems, could critically impair our products, services and ability to conduct business.\n\u25cf Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, and we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services.\nStrategic, Business and Competitive Risks\nImpacts related to the global COVID-19 pandemic are expected to continue to pose risks to our business for the foreseeable future, heighten many of our known risks and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe ongoing effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity, duration and resurgence of the virus; the emergence of new variants of the virus; the uptake and effectiveness of health and safety measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities; the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments; the speed and strength of an economic recovery, including the reopening of borders and the resumption of international travel; increased logistics costs; an increasingly competitive labor market; and the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, our operations, and the business of our partners and suppliers. Specific impacts on our operations and financial results include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Short and long-term difficulties of our retail partners in consumer-based businesses due to restricted foot traffic, any inability to convert in-store sales to e-commerce, trouble maintaining supply chain integrity for both availability of desired products and delivery to end consumers, and reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in increased bankruptcy risk for our retail partners, decreased retail credit sales and decreases in our credit card and other loans balances.\n\u25cf Decreased retail credit sales reduces the usage of our credit cards and other credit products, which reduces our revenue from finance charges and other servicing fees.\n\u25cf The potential for consumer bankruptcies and any forbearance programs we may offer for impacted cardholders to reduce or delay our revenue from finance charges and other servicing fees and increase our exposure to rising delinquencies, net charge-offs in Credit card and other loans and increase our Allowance for credit losses.\n\u25cf Volatility in the financial markets may increase our cost of capital and/or limit its availability, and prolonged periods of increased financial stress enhance the potential for a rating downgrade on our asset-backed debt, the occurrence of early amortization events as well as non-compliance with financial covenants or other events of default across our significant asset-backed and other indebtedness.\n\u25cf Increased operational risk, including impacts to our data, customer care center, digital and installment lending platform and other network integrity and availability in addition to heightened cybercriminal activity and other payment fraud risk in this environment of e-commerce and online banking reliance, may affect our ability to timely and effectively meet the needs of our partners, cardholders or other consumers.\n\u25cf Increased risks to the health and safety of our associates and that of our third-party vendors may impact our ability to maintain service levels for our partners.\n\u25cf Increased privacy-related risks due to processing of employee health-related personal information.\n\u25cf Workforce impacts, such as difficulty recruiting, retaining, training, motivating and developing employees due to evolving health and safety protocols; changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models; restrictions on immigration, travel and employee mobility; and the challenges of maintaining our strong corporate culture, which values communication, collaboration and connections, despite a majority of employees working from home.\nDespite the availability of vaccines and treatments, surges in COVID-19 cases, including variants of the strain, such as the delta and omicron variants, may cause people to self-quarantine or governments to shut down nonessential businesses again. Given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on our future results of operations or cash flows at this time. To the extent the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, many of the other risks described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report may also be heightened.\nChanges and instability in the macroeconomic environment, consumer confidence and customer behavior may adversely affect our business.\nWe offer an array of financial products and services to consumers, and a prolonged period of economic volatility, slow growth, or a significant deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers default on their loans, maintain lower deposit levels or, in the case of credit card accounts, carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity.\nSome of the risks we face in connection with adverse changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment, including changes in consumer confidence levels and behavior, include the following:\n\u25cf Changes in payment patterns, increases in delinquencies and default rates, decreased consumer spending, lower demand for credit and shifts in consumer payment behavior towards avoiding late fees, finance charges and other fees;\n\u25cf Increases in our charge-off rate caused by bankruptcies and reduced ability to recover debt that we have previously charged-off; and\n\u25cf Decreased reliability of the process and models we use to estimate our allowance for credit losses, particularly if unexpected variations in key inputs and assumptions cause actual losses to diverge from the projections of our models and our estimates become increasingly subject to management\u2019s judgment. See \u201cOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective, and the models we rely on may not be accurate or may be misinterpreted.\u201d\nBusiness generated through our relationships with our 10 largest partners represented 59% and 65%, respectively, of our Total net interest and non-interest income, or revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and a decrease in business from, or the loss of, any of these partners could cause a significant drop in our revenue.\nWe depend on a limited number of large partner relationships for a significant portion of our revenue. The business generated through our 10 largest partners represented approximately 59% and 65%, respectively, of our Total net interest and non-interest income during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Business generated through our relationship with Victoria\u2019s Secret & Co. and its retail affiliates represented approximately 13% and 14% of our Total net interest and non-interest income during these same respective periods. A decrease in business from, or the loss of, any of our significant partners for any reason, including a decrease in pricing or activity, or a decision either to utilize another service provider or to no longer outsource some or all of the services we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We previously announced the non-renewal of our contract with BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club (BJ\u2019s). For the year ended December 31, 2021, BJ\u2019s branded co-brand accounts generated approximately 8% of our Total net interest and non-interest income. As of December 31, 2021, BJ\u2019s branded co-brand accounts were responsible for approximately 11% of our Total credit card and other loans.\nOur business is heavily concentrated in U.S. consumer credit, and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a more diversified company.\nOur business is heavily concentrated in U.S. consumer credit. As a result, we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to U.S. consumer credit than a more diversified company. For example, our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the U.S. economy, consumer spending and consumer credit. We are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer (including promotional financing). Our business concentration could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe expect growth to result, in part, from new and acquired credit card and other installment lending or BNPL programs whose credit card and other loans performance could result in increased portfolio losses and negatively impact our profitability.\nWe expect an important source of our growth to come from the acquisition of existing credit card programs and initiating credit card and other installment lending or BNPL programs with retailers and other merchants who either do\nnot currently offer a private label or co-brand credit card or are initiating or transitioning from another installment lending or BNPL platform. Although we believe our pricing and models for determining credit risk are designed to evaluate the credit risk of existing programs and the credit risk we are willing to assume for acquired and start-up programs, we cannot be assured that the loss experience on acquired and start-up programs will be consistent with our more established programs. The failure to successfully underwrite these new or acquired credit card or installment lending programs may result in defaults greater than our expectations and could have a material adverse impact on us and our profitability. See \u201cOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective, and the models we rely on may not be accurate or may be misinterpreted.\u201d\nIncreases in net charge-offs could have a negative impact on our net income and profitability.\nThe primary risk associated with unsecured consumer lending is the risk of default or bankruptcy of the borrower, resulting in the borrower\u2019s balance being charged-off as uncollectible. We rely principally on the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness for repayment of the loan and therefore have no other recourse for collection. We may not be able to successfully identify and evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers to minimize delinquencies and losses. The models and approaches we use to manage our credit risk, including our automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures for new accountholders, establishing or adjusting their credit limits and applying our risk-based pricing, may not accurately predict future charge-offs for various reasons discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors, including see \u201cOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective, and the models we rely on may not be accurate or may be misinterpreted\u201d below. An increase in defaults or net charge-offs could result in a reduction in Net income. General economic factors, such as the rate of inflation, unemployment levels and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. In addition to being affected by general economic conditions and the success of our collection and recovery efforts, the stability of our delinquency and net charge-off rates are affected by the credit risk of our Credit card and other loans and the average age of our various credit card account portfolios. Further, our pricing strategy may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses, thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. For 2021, our net charge-off rate was 4.6%, compared to 6.6% and 6.1% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Delinquency rates were 3.9% of principal Credit card and other loans at December 31, 2021, compared to 4.4% and 5.8% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective, and the models we rely on may not be accurate or may be misinterpreted.\nOur risk management framework that seeks to identify and mitigate current or future risks and appropriately balance risk and return may not be comprehensive or fully effective. As regulations and competition continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business, including liquidity and capital planning (including stress testing), customer selection, credit and other risk management, pricing, reserving and collections management. The models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a variety of reasons, including as a result of errors in constructing, interpreting or using the models or the use of inaccurate assumptions (including failures to update assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner). Our assumptions may be inaccurate for many reasons including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control (e.g., macroeconomic conditions and their impact on partner and customer behaviors) and they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors and other assumptions. The errors or inaccuracies in our models may be material, and could lead us to make poor or sub-optimal decisions in managing our business, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFraudulent activity associated with our products and services could negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and cause the use of our products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase.\nWe are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with retailers, partners, other merchant parties or third-party service providers handling consumer information. Our fraud-related operational losses were $71 million, $141 million and $195 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our products are susceptible to application fraud, because among other things, we provide immediate access to credit at the time of\napproval. In addition, digital sales on the internet and through mobile channels are becoming a larger part of our business and fraudulent activity is higher as a percentage of sales in those channels than in stores. The different financial products that we offer, including deposit products, are susceptible to different types of fraud, and, depending on our product mix and channel mix, we may continue to experience variations in, or levels of, fraud-related expense that are different from or higher than that experienced by some of our competitors or the industry generally. The risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry, and credit card and deposit fraud, identity theft and related crimes are likely to continue to be prevalent, with perpetrators increasingly sophisticated. Our resources, technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud. High profile fraudulent activity could also negatively impact our brand and reputation, which could negatively impact the use of our services, leading to a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention, including, but not limited to, additional consumer notification requirements, increasing our costs and negatively impacting our operating results, net income and profitability.\nThe amount of our Allowance for credit losses could adversely affect our business and may prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses on our loans.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s accounting standard relating to Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and requires us to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. In addition, for portfolios we may acquire when we enter into new partner program agreements, we are required to establish at acquisition an allowance for expected credit losses for the life of the acquired loan portfolio. Any subsequent deterioration in the performance of the purchased portfolios after acquisition results in incremental credit loss reserves. Growth in our loan portfolio generally would also lead to an increase in our Allowance for credit losses.\nThe process for establishing an allowance for credit losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition, and requires complex models and judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions. The ongoing impact of CECL will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our Credit card and other loans, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. For additional information regarding the adoption of CECL and its impact, see Note 4, \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this Annual Report.\nThe CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our Allowance for credit losses. If we are required (as a result of any review, update, regulatory guidance or otherwise) to materially increase our level of Allowance for credit losses, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and opportunity to pursue new business. Moreover, we may underestimate our expected losses, and we cannot assure you that our credit loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses.\nWe may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, dispositions and strategic investments, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses, including Bread, and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. If we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or accretive new business opportunities, our growth could be limited.\nSimilarly, we may evaluate the potential disposition of, or elect to divest, assets or portfolios that no longer complement our long-term strategic objectives, as we did in November 2021, when we completed the spinoff of our LoyaltyOne segment. When a determination is made to divest assets or portfolios, we may encounter difficulty attaining buyers or effecting desired exit strategies in a timely manner or on acceptable terms and may be subject to market forces leading to a divestiture on less than optimal price or other terms.\nIn addition, there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions and the implementation of new business opportunities, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the difficulty and expense that we incur in connection with the acquisition, disposition or new business opportunity;\n\u25cf the inability to satisfy pre-closing conditions preventing consummation of the acquisition, disposition or new business opportunity;\n\u25cf the potential for adverse consequences when conforming the acquired company\u2019s accounting policies to ours;\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf the potential loss of customers or key employees of the acquired company;\n\u25cf the impact on our financial condition due to the timing of the acquisition, disposition or new business implementation or the failure of the acquired or new business to meet operating expectations;\n\u25cf the acceptance of continued financial responsibility with respect to a divested business, including required equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations;\n\u25cf the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired company;\n\u25cf the uncertainty of achieving expected benefits of an acquisition or disposition, including revenue, human resources, technological or other cost savings, operating efficiencies or synergies;\n\u25cf the reduction of cash available for operations, stock repurchase programs or other uses and potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf the requirement to provide transition services in connection with a disposition resulting in the diversion of resources and focus; and\n\u25cf the difficulty retaining and motivating key personnel from acquisitions or in connection with dispositions.\nFor example, upon the disposition of Epsilon in July 2019, we agreed to indemnify Publicis Groupe S.A. for the matter included in Note 15, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which has resulted in a $150.0 million charge associated with Epsilon\u2019s deferred prosecution agreement with the United States Department of Justice requiring two $75.0 million payments in January 2021 and January 2022, respectively.\nFurthermore, if the operations of an acquired or new business do not meet expectations, our profitability may decline and we may seek to restructure the acquired business or to impair the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired or new business.\nThe markets for the services that we offer may contract or fail to expand and competition in our industries is intense, each of which could negatively impact our growth and profitability.\nThe markets for our products and services are highly competitive, and we expect this competition to intensify. Our growth and continued profitability depend on continued acceptance or adoption of the products and services that we offer. We compete with a wide range of businesses, and some of our current competitors have longer operating histories, stronger brand names and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In seeking to acquire and retain business with brand partners, we compete with these competitors on the basis of a number of factors, including program financial and other terms, underwriting standards, marketing expertise, service levels, product and service offerings, technological capabilities and integration, brand and reputation. See \u201cOur results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners\u201d below. Our partners may not continue to use the financial products and services, or loyalty programs, that we offer. Moreover, the consumer credit and payments industry is highly competitive and we face an increasingly dynamic industry as emerging technologies enter the marketplace. As a form of payment, our products compete with cash, checks, debit cards, general purpose credit cards (including Visa and MasterCard, American Express and Discover Card), various forms of consumer installment loans and BNPL products, other private label card brands, prepaid cards, digital wallets and mobile payment solutions, and other tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. Changes in technology may enable merchants and retail companies to directly process transactions in a cost-efficient manner without the use of our services. In addition, some of our competitors, including new and existing competitors in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject. Non-bank providers of pay-over-time solutions, such as Affirm, Afterpay and others, extend consumer credit-like offerings but do not face the same restrictions as banks, such as capital requirements and other regulatory requirements, which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition\u201d of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the competitive environment in the markets where we operate. Additionally, downturns in the economy or the performance of our retail or other partners, including the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, may result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services. Our ability to generate significant revenue from partners and consumers will depend on our ability to differentiate ourselves through the products and services we provide and the attractiveness of our programs to consumers. If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of\nour competitors, drive value for our partners and their customers, or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively in the market. Any decrease in the demand for our products and services for the reasons discussed above or any other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenue and operating results.\nOur results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners.\nFollowing the disposition of our Epsilon business and the spinoff of our LoyaltyOne segment, the majority of our revenue is generated from the credit products we provide to customers of our partners pursuant to program agreements that we enter into with our partners. As a result, our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners. Historically, there has been turnover in our partners, and we expect this will continue in the future. See also, \u201cBusiness generated through our relationships with our 10 largest partners represented 59% and 65%, respectively, of our total net interest and non-interest income, or revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and a decrease in business from, or the loss of, any of these partners could cause a significant drop in our revenue.\u201d\nProgram agreements with our retail and other brand partners typically are for multi-year terms. These program agreements generally permit our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons, including, in some cases, if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria, we fail to achieve certain targets with respect to approvals of new customers as a result of the credit criteria we use, we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loans under the program reach certain thresholds or we are not adequately capitalized, or certain force majeure events or changes in our ownership occur or a material adverse change in our financial condition occurs.\nThere is significant competition for our existing partners, and our failure to retain our existing larger partner relationships upon the expiration of a contractual arrangement or our earlier loss of a relationship upon the exercise of a partner\u2019s early termination rights, or the expiration or termination of a substantial number of smaller partner contracts or relationships, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including growth rates) and financial condition to the extent we do not acquire new partners of similar size and profitability or otherwise grow our business. In addition, existing relationships may be renewed with less favorable terms to us in response to increased competition for such relationships. The competition for new partners is also significant, and our failure to attract new partners could adversely affect our ability to grow.\nOur results depend, to a significant extent, on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our brand partners.\nOur partners generally accept most major credit cards and various other forms of payment; therefore our success depends on their active and effective promotion of our products to their customers. We depend on our partners to integrate the use of our credit products into their operations, including into their in-store and online shopping experiences and loyalty programs. We rely on our partners to train their sales and call center associates about our products and to have their associates encourage customers to apply for, and use, our products and otherwise effectively marketing our products. If our partners do not effectively promote and support our products, or if they make changes in their business models that negatively impact card usage, these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Partners may also implement or fail to implement changes in their systems and technologies that may disrupt the integration between their systems and technologies and ours, which could disrupt the use of our products. In addition, if our partners engage in improper business practices, do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements or other contractual arrangements or standards, or otherwise diminish the value of our brand, we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur results are impacted, to a significant extent, by the financial performance of our partners.\nOur ability to originate new credit card accounts, generate new loans, and earn interest and fees and other income is dependent, in part, upon sales of merchandise and services by our partners. The retail and other industries in which our partners operate are intensely competitive. Our partners\u2019 sales may decrease or may not increase as we anticipate for various reasons, some of which are in the partners\u2019 control and some of which are not. For example, partner sales may be adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic or other macroeconomic conditions having a national, regional or\nmore local effect on consumer spending, business conditions affecting the general retail environment or a particular partner or industry, or natural disasters or other catastrophes affecting broad or more discrete geographic areas. If our partners\u2019 sales decline for any reason, it generally results in lower credit sales, and therefore lower loan volume and associated interest and fees and other income for us from their customers. In addition, if a partner closes some or all of its stores or becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding (or if there is a perception that it may become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding), its customers who have used our financing products may have less incentive to pay their outstanding balances to us, which could result in higher charge-off rates than anticipated and our costs for servicing its customers\u2019 accounts may increase. This risk is particularly acute with respect to our largest partners that account for a significant amount of our interest and fees on loans. See \u201cBusiness generated through our relationships with our 10 largest partners represented 59% and 65%, respectively, of our Total net interest and non-interest income, or revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and a decrease in business from, or the loss of, any of these partners could cause a significant drop in our revenue.\u201d Moreover, if the financial condition of a partner deteriorates significantly or a partner becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, we may not be able to recover for customer returns, customer payments made in partner stores or other amounts due to us from the partner. A decrease in sales by our partners for any reason or a bankruptcy proceeding involving any of them could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to promote usage of our proprietary cards, or to effectively control the costs associated with such promotion, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\nWe have been investing in promoting the usage of our proprietary cards, but there can be no assurance that our investments to acquire cardholders, provide differentiated features and services and increase usage of our proprietary cards will be effective, particularly with increasing competition from other card issuers and fintechs as well as changing consumer and business behaviors as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, cardholder attrition and costs could increase. Moreover, we may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand cardholder benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and cardholder services expenses in the future.\nReductions in interchange fees may reduce the competitive advantages our private label credit card products currently have by virtue of not charging interchange fees and would reduce our income from those fees.\nInterchange is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network\u2019s infrastructure and payment facilitation, and which are paid to credit card issuers to compensate them for the risk they bear in lending money to customers. We earn interchange fees on co-brand and general purpose credit card transactions but we typically do not charge or earn interchange fees from our partners or customers on our private label credit card products.\nMerchants, trying to decrease their operating expenses, have sought to, and have had some success at, lowering interchange rates. Several recent events and actions indicate a continuing increase in focus on interchange by both regulators and merchants. Beyond pursuing litigation, legislation and regulation, merchants are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs. To the extent interchange fees are reduced, one of our current competitive advantages with our partners-that we typically do not charge interchange fees when our private label credit card products are used to purchase our partners\u2019 goods and services-may be reduced. Moreover, to the extent interchange fees are reduced, our income from those fees will be lower. As a result, a reduction in interchange fees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, for our co-brand and general purpose credit cards, we are subject to the operating regulations and procedures set forth by the interchange network, and our failure to comply with these operating regulations, which may change from time to time, could subject us to various penalties or fees, or the termination of our license to use the interchange network, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to retain and/or attract and hire a highly qualified and diverse workforce, or maintain our corporate culture, which could impact our ability to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key personnel and senior management. We may be unable to retain or to attract highly qualified employees. The market for key personnel is highly competitive, particularly in technology and other skill areas significant to our business. Moreover, as a result of\nthe global COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our workforce is working in a mostly remote environment. This remote environment may continue after the pandemic due to potential resulting trends, and could impact the quality of our corporate culture. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, creativity and teamwork could harm our overall business and results of operations. We rely on key personnel to lead with integrity and decency. To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that is not consistent with our values, we could experience significant impact to our brand and reputation, as well as to our corporate culture.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nIn recent years, financial services companies have experienced increased reputational risk as consumers protest and regulators scrutinize business and compliance practices of such companies. Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to attracting and retaining partners, customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct; a breach of our or our service providers\u2019 cybersecurity defenses; litigation or regulatory outcomes; failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality; compliance failures; and the activities of customers, business partners and counterparties. Social media also can cause harm to our reputation. By its very nature, social media can reach a wide audience in a very short amount of time, which presents unique challenges for corporate communications. Negative or otherwise undesirable publicity generated through unexpected social media coverage can damage our reputation and brand. Negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may result in customer attrition and other harm to our business prospects. There has also been increased focus on topics related to environmental, social and corporate governance policies, and criticism of our policies in these areas could also harm our reputation and/or potentially limit our access to some forms of capital or liquidity.\nLiquidity, Market and Credit Risks\nAdverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and ability to meet our debt service requirements and other obligations.\nWe need to effectively manage our funding and liquidity in order to meet our cash requirements such as day-to-day operating expenses, extensions of credit to our customers, investments to grow our business, payments of principal and interest on our borrowings and payments on our other obligations. Our primary sources of funding and liquidity are collections from our customers, deposits, funds from securitized financings and proceeds from unsecured borrowings, including our credit facility and outstanding notes. If we do not have sufficient liquidity, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements and other obligations, particularly during a liquidity stress event. If we maintain or are required to maintain too much liquidity, it could be costly and reduce our financial flexibility.\nWe will need additional financing in the future to refinance any existing debt and finance growth of our business. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as financial market conditions generally, including the availability of credit to the financial services industry, consumers\u2019 willingness to place money on deposit with us, our performance and credit ratings and the performance of our securitized portfolios. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital, credit or deposit markets, such as the uncertainty and volatility experienced in the capital and credit markets during periods of financial stress and other economic and political conditions in the global markets and concerning the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal measures that may be taken over the longer term to address these matters, may limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance maturing liabilities on desired terms (including funding costs) in a timely manner or at all. As a result, we may be forced to delay obtaining funding or be forced to issue or raise funding on undesirable terms, which could significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause us to contract or not grow our business, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWhile financial market conditions are generally stable at the present time, there can be no assurance that significant disruptions, uncertainties and volatility will not occur in the future. If we are unable to continue to finance our business, access capital markets and attract deposits on favorable terms and in a timely manner, or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to securitize our credit card loans due to changes in the market or other circumstances or events, we may not be able to fund new credit card loans, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe use the securitization of credit card loans, which involves the transfer of credit card loans to a trust, and the issuance by the trust of notes to third-party investors collateralized by the beneficial interest in the transferred credit card loans, as a significant source of funding. A number of factors affect our ability to fund our credit card and other loans in the securitization market, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf conditions in the securities markets in general and the asset-backed securitization market in particular;\n\u25cf availability of loans for securitization;\n\u25cf conformity in the quality of our credit card loans to rating agency requirements and changes in that quality or those requirements;\n\u25cf costs of securitizing our credit card loans;\n\u25cf ability to fund required overcollateralizations or credit enhancements, which are routinely utilized in order to achieve better credit ratings to lower borrowing cost; and\n\u25cf the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally.\nMoreover, as a result of Basel III, which refers generally to a set of regulatory reforms adopted in the U.S. and internationally that are meant to address issues that arose in the banking sector during the 2008-2010 financial crisis, banks have become subject to more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements. In response to Basel III, certain lenders of private placement commitments within our securitization trusts have sought and obtained amendments to their respective transaction documents permitting them to delay disbursement of funding increases by up to 35 days. Although funding may be requested from other lenders who have not delayed their funding, access to financing could be disrupted if all of the lenders implement such delays or if the lending capacities of those who did not do so were insufficient to make up the shortfall. In addition, excess spread may be affected if the issuing entity\u2019s borrowing costs increase as a result of Basel III. Such cost increases may result, for example, because the investors are entitled to indemnification for increased costs resulting from such regulatory changes.\nThe inability to securitize credit card loans due to changes in the market, regulatory proposals, the unavailability of credit enhancements, or any other circumstance or event would have a material adverse effect on our operations, cost of funds and overall financial condition.\nThe occurrence of events that result in the early amortization of our existing credit card securitization transactions or an inability to delay the accumulation of principal collections for our existing credit card securitization transactions would materially adversely affect our liquidity.\nOur liquidity and cost of funds would be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing credit card securitization transactions. Early amortization events may occur as a result of certain adverse events specified for each asset-backed securitization transaction, including, among others, deteriorating asset performance or material servicing defaults. In addition, certain series of funding securities issued by our securitization trusts are subject to early amortization based on triggers relating to the bankruptcy of one or more retailers or other partners. Deteriorating economic conditions and increased competition in the retail industry, among other factors, may lead to an increase in bankruptcies among retailers who have entered into credit card programs with us. The bankruptcy of one or more retailers or other partners could lead to a decline in the amount of new loans and could lead to increased delinquencies and defaults on the associated loans. Any of these effects of a partner bankruptcy could result in the commencement of an early amortization for one or more series of such funding securities, particularly if such an event were to occur with respect to a retailer or other partner relating to a large percentage of such securitization trust\u2019s assets. The occurrence of an early amortization event may significantly limit our ability to securitize additional loans and materially adversely affect our liquidity.\nLower payment rates on our securitized credit card loans could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nCertain collections from our securitized credit card loans come back to us through our subsidiaries, and we use these collections to fund our purchase of newly originated loans to collateralize our securitized financings. If payment rates on our securitized credit card loans are lower than they have historically been, fewer collections will be remitted to us on an ongoing basis. Further, certain series of our asset-backed securities include a requirement that we accumulate principal collections in a restricted account for a specified number of months prior to the applicable security\u2019s maturity date. We are required under the program documents to lengthen this accumulation period to the extent we expect the payment rates to be low enough that the current length of the accumulation period is inadequate to fully fund the restricted account by the applicable security\u2019s maturity date. Lower payment rates, and in particular, payment rates that are low enough that we are required to lengthen our accumulation periods, could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nInability to grow our deposits in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, ability to grow our business and profitability.\nA significant source of our funds is customer deposits, primarily in the form of certificates of deposit and other savings products. We obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers or through brokerage firms that offer our deposit products to their customers. Our funding strategy includes continued growth of our liquidity through deposits. The deposit business continues to experience intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits. We compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits, the quality of our customer service and the competitiveness of our digital banking capabilities. Our ability to attract and maintain retail deposits remains highly dependent on the strength of our Banks, the reputability of our business practices and our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our lending practices, regulatory compliance, protection of customer information or sales and marketing practices, or actions taken by regulators or others with respect to our Banks, could impede our competitive position in the deposits market.\nThe demand for the deposit products we offer may also be reduced due to a variety of factors, including changes in consumers\u2019 preferences, demographics or discretionary income, regulatory actions that decrease consumer access to particular products or the development or availability of competing products. Competition from other financial services firms and others that use deposit funding products may affect deposit renewal rates, costs or availability. Adjustments we make to the rates offered on our deposit products to remain competitive may adversely affect conversely our liquidity or our profitability.\nThe FDIA prohibits an insured bank from offering interest rates on any deposits that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market, unless it is \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d A bank that is less than \u201cwell capitalized\u201d may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. There are no such restrictions under the FDIA on a bank that is \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and at December 31, 2021, each of our Banks met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for purposes of the FDIA. However, there can be no assurance that our Banks will continue to meet those requirements. Any limitation on the interest rates our Banks can pay on deposits may competitively disadvantage us in attracting and retaining deposits, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FDIA also prohibits an insured bank from accepting brokered deposits, unless it is \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d or it is \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d and receives a waiver from the FDIC. Limitations on our Banks\u2019 ability to accept brokered deposits for any reason (including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total assets) in the future could materially adversely impact our liquidity, funding costs and profitability. In December 2020, the FDIC updated its regulations that implement Section 29 of the FDIA to establish a new framework for analyzing whether certain deposit arrangements qualify as brokered deposits. The new brokered deposit rule establishes bright-line standards for determining whether an entity meets the statutory definition of \u201cdeposit broker,\u201d and a consistent process for application of the primary purpose exception. At December 31, 2021, each of our Banks met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for purposes of the FDIA. Also, all deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of our Banks categorized as non-brokered under the updated regulations mentioned above comply with all application requirements of said regulations. Any limitation on the ability of our Banks to participate in the gathering of brokered deposits may competitively disadvantage us in meeting our funding goals and result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $11.0 billion in deposits, with approximately $5.6 billion in non-maturity savings deposits and approximately $5.4 billion in certificates of deposit.\nOur level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash to repay our outstanding debt, our ability to react to changes in our business and our incurrence of additional indebtedness to fund future needs could exacerbate these risks.\nOur level of indebtedness requires a high level of interest and principal payments. Subject to the limits contained in our credit agreement, the indentures governing our senior notes and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could:\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under our credit agreement, the indentures governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other new business and other corporate purposes;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage or require us to dispose of assets to raise funds if needed for working capital or to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other new business and other corporate purposes;\n\u25cf delay or abandon investments and capital expenditures;\n\u25cf cause any refinancing of our indebtedness to be at higher interest rates and require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations; and\n\u25cf prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of certain changes of control.\nRestrictions imposed by the indentures governing our senior notes, our credit agreement and our other outstanding or future indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nThe terms of the indentures governing our senior notes, our credit agreement and agreements governing our other debt instruments limit us and our subsidiaries from engaging in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability, among other things, to:\n\u25cf incur additional debt;\n\u25cf declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\u25cf make investments;\n\u25cf create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u25cf merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf sell or transfer certain assets; and\n\u25cf enter into any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make loans or sell assets to us.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional indebtedness to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future. If we fail to comply with such covenants, we may not be able to obtain waivers of non-compliance from the lenders and/or amend the covenants so that we are in compliance therewith.\nChanges in market interest rates could negatively affect our profitability.\nChanges in market interest rates cause our finance charges, net and our interest expense, net to increase or decrease, as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks. We fund credit card and other loans with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits and asset-backed securities. We also have unsecured term debt that is subject to variable interest rates.\nThe interest rate benchmark for most of our floating rate assets is the prime rate, and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) or the federal funds rate. See \u201cThe discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements\u201d below. The prime rate and LIBOR or the federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products, and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the U.S. Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has already indicated plans for multiple interest rate increases in 2022, could influence the amount of interest we receive on our credit card and other loans and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings.\nIf the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on our credit card and other loans, our profitability would be adversely affected. Conversely, our profitability could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on our credit card and other loans falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings.\nThe discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements.\nCentral banks and global regulators have called for financial market participants to prepare for the discontinuance of LIBOR and the establishment of alternative reference rates. Certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements reference LIBOR, which will need to be amended or otherwise modified to replace LIBOR with an alternative reference rate. Most of those instruments and agreements contain provisions to replace LIBOR as the benchmark following the occurrence of specified transition events. To facilitate an orderly transition away from LIBOR, we have established an enterprise-wide initiative to assess and implement necessary changes to our contracts, systems, processes, documentation, and models. These changes may introduce operational challenges and have a negative impact on our interest expense and profitability\nAlternative reference rates are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate differently than, and not be representative of, LIBOR. In order to compensate for these differences, certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment. However, there is no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR, either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements.\nUncertainty as to the nature and timing of the potential discontinuance or modification of LIBOR, the replacement of LIBOR with one or more alternative reference rates or other reforms may negatively impact market liquidity, our access to funding and the trading market for our financial instruments. Furthermore, the timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could be subject to disputes, could cause the financial obligations related to our outstanding financial instruments and commercial agreements to be materially different than expected and may impact the value of such instruments and agreements.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales could occur, may adversely affect our common stock price.\nAs of February 18, 2022, we had an aggregate of 146,873,346 shares of our common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes. In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. We have reserved 3,934,553 shares of our common stock for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan and our long-term incentive plans, of which 749,265 shares have been issued and 1,166,516 shares are issuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. We have reserved for issuance 1,500,000 shares of our common stock, 290,897 of which remain issuable, under our 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions. For example, on December 3, 2020, we issued 1,903,868 shares of our common stock in a private placement completed with our acquisition of Lon Inc. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and any sale or issuance of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and our stock price could decline.\nThe trading price of shares of our common stock has from time to time fluctuated widely and in the future may be subject to similar fluctuations. The trading price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including our operating results, changes in our earnings estimates, additions or departures of key personnel, our financial condition, legislative and regulatory changes, general conditions in the industries in which we operate, general economic conditions, and general conditions in the securities markets. In addition, until the market has fully evaluated our business without Loyalty Ventures, the price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly. Other risks described in this Annual Report could also materially and adversely affect our share price.\nThere is no guarantee that we will pay future dividends or repurchase shares at a level anticipated by stockholders, which could reduce returns to our stockholders. Decisions to declare future dividends on, or repurchase, our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors based upon a review of relevant considerations.\nSince October 2016, our Board of Directors has declared quarterly cash dividend payments on our outstanding common stock. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by our Board of Directors. In the approximately 20 years since our initial public offering, our Board of Directors has approved various share repurchase programs resulting in the repurchase of approximately 67.4 million shares of our common stock, although there is no active share repurchase program at this time. The Board\u2019s determination to declare dividends on, or repurchase shares of, our common stock will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. For example, beginning with the second quarter of 2020, our Board of Directors reduced our quarterly dividend payment by 67% from $0.63 to $0.21 per quarter. Based on an evaluation of these factors, the Board of Directors may determine not to declare future dividends at all, to declare future dividends at a reduced amount, not to repurchase shares or to repurchase shares at reduced levels compared to historical levels, any or all of which could reduce returns to our stockholders.\nWe are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries.\nAlliance Data Systems Corporation, our parent holding company, depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from subsidiaries, particularly our Banks, to fund dividend payments, any potential share repurchases, payment obligations, including debt obligations, and to provide funding and capital as needed to our other operating subsidiaries. Banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit or prohibit our transfer of funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries, at any time. These laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations or otherwise achieve strategic objectives. For more information, see \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nOur business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe, primarily through our Banks and certain non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are intended to protect consumers, depositors\u2019 funds, the DIF, and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies (including as a result of leadership changes at the federal banking agencies resulting from the 2020 election), could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, and/or limit what we may charge for certain banking services, among other things.\nWe expect that the current presidential administration will continue to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different than that of the previous administration. This reform agenda could include a heightened focus on consumer protection, fair lending, heightened scrutiny on Bank Secrecy Act and AML requirements, topics related to social equity, executive compensation, and increased capital and liquidity, as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends. It is uncertain whether and to what extent the current administration will increase the regulatory burden on banks, and changes in existing regulations and their enforcement may require modification to the Banks\u2019 existing regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nSee \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation\u201d for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.\nLitigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses, damage to our reputation and/or a material adverse effect on our business.\nBusinesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been, and continue to be, subject to significant legal actions, including class action lawsuits. Many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future, including as a result of regulation that would require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions, and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation.\nWe have been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be subject to such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations and enforcement proceedings, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. External publicity concerning investigations, including those that are narrow in scope, can increase their scope and scale and lead to further regulatory inquiries.\nWe expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping\ninvestigations and proceedings. Regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in cardholder reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernmental authorities have adopted or proposed measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize markets and support economic growth in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The future success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic. Additionally, some measures, such as a suspension of loan payments and encouragement of forbearances, has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions, such as a renewed focus on fair lending laws, and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.\nIn addition to litigation and regulatory matters, from time to time, through our operational and compliance controls, we identify compliance issues that require us to make operational changes and, depending on the nature of the issue, result in financial remediation to impacted cardholders. These self-identified issues and voluntary remediation payments could be significant depending on the issue and the number of cardholders impacted. They also could generate litigation or regulatory investigations that subject us to additional adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Banks are subject to extensive federal and state regulation that may restrict their ability to make cash available to us and may require us to make capital contributions to them.\nFederal and state laws and regulations extensively regulate the operations of our Banks, including to limit the ability of the Banks to pay dividends to us. Many of these laws and regulations are intended to maintain the safety and soundness of our Banks, and they impose significant restraints on them to which other non-regulated entities are not subject.\nOur Banks must maintain minimum amounts of regulatory capital. If the Banks do not meet these capital requirements, their respective regulators have broad discretion to institute a number of corrective actions that could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. To pay any dividend, the Banks must each maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. Accordingly, neither Comenity Bank nor Comenity Capital Bank may be able to make any of its cash or other assets available to us, including to service our indebtedness. If either of our Banks were to fail to meet any of the capital requirements to which it is subject, we may be required to provide them with additional capital, which could also impair our ability to service our indebtedness.\nIn addition, under the \u201csource of strength\u201d requirement, we are required to serve as a source of financial strength to our Banks and may not conduct our operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to our Banks if the Banks experience financial distress. This support may be required at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in tour interests or the interests of our shareholders or creditors.\nIf legislative attempts to amend the Bank Holding Company Act to eliminate the exclusion of credit card banks or industrial loan companies from the definition of \u201cbank\u201d are successful, we may become a bank holding company.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in future legislative or regulatory action. In particular, the Government Accountability Office issued its study on whether it is necessary, in order to strengthen the safety and soundness of institutions or the stability of the financial system of the United States, to eliminate the exemptions to the definition of \u201cbank\u201d under the Bank Holding Company Act for certain institutions including limited purpose credit card banks and industrial loan companies. The study did not recommend the elimination of these exemptions. However, legislation is periodically introduced that would eliminate this exception for industrial loan companies and other \u201cnonbank banks\u201d. If such legislation were enacted without any grandfathering of or accommodations for existing institutions, we could be required to become a bank holding company.\nAs a bank holding company, we and our nonbank subsidiaries would be subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. We would be required to provide annual reports and such additional\ninformation as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHC Act, and applicable regulations. In addition, we would be subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements.\nPursuant to provisions of the BHC Act and regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board thereunder, a bank holding company may only engage in, or own companies that engage in, activities deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be permissible for bank holding companies or financial holding companies. Activities permissible for bank holding companies are those that are so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Permissible activities for financial holding companies include those \"so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto\" as well as certain additional activities deemed \"financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity\" or complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of the depository institution or the financial system. If we were required to become a bank holding company, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain of our business activities, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that are required to be paid for FDIC insurance. If there are bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay significantly higher premiums than the levels currently imposed or additional special assessments or taxes that could adversely affect earnings. Any future increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nNoncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial loss.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and the PATRIOT Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the PATRIOT Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of partners, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. FinCEN, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and IRS.\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection, data governance, account access and information and cyber security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information.\nLegislators and regulators in the United States and other countries are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection, data governance, account access and information and cyber security laws, including data localization, authentication and notification laws. As such laws are interpreted and applied (in some cases, with significant differences or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions), compliance and technology costs will continue to increase, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data governance, data protection, data transfer and account access mechanisms are in place.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection, data governance, account access and information and cyber security laws could significantly impact our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or colleague information and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with such laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security in the United States, the EU and various other countries.\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see \u201cPrivacy and Data Protection Regulation\u201d above.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\nOperational risk is the risk arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses result from internal fraud; external fraud; inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety; failure to meet professional obligations involving partners, products, and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and systems failures; and/or failures in execution, delivery, and process management. As processes or organizations are changed, or new products and services are introduced, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Through human error, fraud or malfeasance, conduct risk can result in harm to customers, broader markets and the company and its employees.\nCompliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures. We need to continually update and enhance our control environment to address operational and compliance risks. Operational and compliance failures or deficiencies in our control environment can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and use of open source software may harm our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and profitability.\nThird parties may infringe or misappropriate our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. The actions we take to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against us. Any claims and an adverse determination in any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and require us to either design around a third party\u2019s patent or license alternative technology from another party. In addition, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources. Further, our competitors or other third parties may independently design around or develop similar technology, or otherwise duplicate our services or products in a way that would preclude us from asserting our intellectual property rights against them. In addition, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure.\nAspects of our platform include software covered by open source licenses. United States courts have not interpreted the terms of various open source licenses, but could interpret them in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our platform. If portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could also be required to, under certain circumstances, publicly release or license, at no cost, our products that incorporate the open source software or the affected portions of our source code. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement, misappropriation, security vulnerabilities, defects or errors in the code or other violations, any of which could result in liability to us and negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nWe have international operations that subject us to various international risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs.\nWe have international operations, primarily in India, and some of our third-party service providers provide services to us from other countries, all of which subject us to a number of international risks, including, among other things, sovereign volatility and socio-political instability. Any future political or social instability in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. U.S. regulations also govern various aspects of the international activities of domestic corporations and increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs. Any failure on our part or the part of our service providers to comply with applicable U.S. regulations, as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in which we or they operate, could result in fines, penalties, injunctions or other\nsimilar restrictions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent or delay change of control transactions or attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nDelaware law, as well as provisions of our certificate of incorporation, including those relating to our Board\u2019s authority to issue series of preferred stock without further stockholder approval, our bylaws and our existing and future debt instruments, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us, even though such proposals may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board of Directors, including a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium over the market price of our common stock that they might otherwise receive.\nCybersecurity, Technology and Vendor Risks\nWe rely on third party vendors to provide products and services and are transitioning additional services to strategic outsourcing partners. Our business operations, reputation and profitability could be adversely impacted if our vendors fail to fulfill their obligations.\nThe failure of our suppliers to deliver products and services at contracted service levels or standards or in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business. These impacts arise from and include, but are not limited to, closures or restricted operating conditions and supply chain disruptions resulting from the current impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. If our significant vendors were unable or unwilling to fulfill or renew our existing contracts on current terms, we might not be able to replace the related product or service at the same cost, in a timely fashion, or at all, any of which could negatively impact our profitability. In addition, if a third party vendor fails to meet contractual requirements, such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our business operations could suffer economic or reputational harm that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nFurther, we are in the process of transitioning our credit card processing to strategic outsourcing partners with targeted completion in 2022, and we have also recently completed outsourcing certain print and mail and remittance processing functions. Transitioning these services from our legacy platforms to strategic partners with established systems and functionality presents significant risks, including, but not limited to, potential losses or corruption of data, changes in security processes, implementation delays and cost overruns, resistance from current partners and account holders, disruption to operations, loss of customization or functionality, reliability issues with legacy systems prior to cutover and incurrence of outsized consulting costs to complete the transition. In addition, the pursuit of multiple new product integrations and outsourcing transitions simultaneously could increase the complexity and risk, as well as magnify the unintended consequences, including an inability to retain or replace key personnel during the transition as well as the incurrence of unexpected expenses as we adopt new processes for managing these service providers and establish controls and procedures to ensure regulatory compliance. Any transition or implementation delays, errors or difficulties may result in operational challenges, security failures, increased costs or reputational harm, any of which could materially adversely impact our profitability.\nFailure to safeguard our data and consumer privacy could affect our reputation among our partners and their customers, and may expose us to legal claims.\nAlthough we have extensive physical and cyber security controls and associated procedures, our data has in the past been and in the future may be subject to unauthorized access. In such instances of unauthorized access, we may have data loss that could harm our loan holders. This in turn could lead to reputational risk as concerns with security and\nprivacy of data may result in consumers not wanting to participate in our product offerings. Information security risks for large financial institutions have increased with the adoption of new technologies, including those used on mobile devices, to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activity level of threat actors. The use of our products and services could decline if any compromise of physical or cyber security occurred. In addition, any unauthorized release of customer information or any public perception that we released consumer information without authorization, could subject us to legal claims from our partners or their customers, consumers or regulatory enforcement actions, which may adversely affect our partner relationships. We cannot be certain that our cybersecurity insurance coverage will be adequate for cybersecurity liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nBusiness interruptions, including loss of data center capacity, interruption due to cyber-attacks, loss of network connectivity or inability to utilize proprietary software of third party vendors, could affect our ability to timely meet the needs of our partners and customers and harm our business.\nOur ability, and that of our third-party service providers, to protect our data centers and other facilities and systems against damage, loss or performance degradation from power loss, network failure, cyber-attacks, including ransomware or denial of service attacks, insider threats, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, human error, computer viruses or other malware, public health crises, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, fires and other disasters and other events is critical. In order to provide many of our services, we must be able to store, retrieve, process and manage large amounts of data as well as periodically expand and upgrade our technology capabilities. Any damage to our data centers or other facilities and systems, or those of our third-party service providers, any failure of our network links that interrupts our operations or any impairment of our ability to use our software or the proprietary software of third party vendors, including impairments due to cyber-attacks, could adversely affect our ability to meet our partners\u2019 needs and their confidence in utilizing us for future services. In addition, any failure to successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business if we are not able to be competitive with other financial services companies, and could also adversely impact our internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in access management, vulnerability management, transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement, and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our existing technology.\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours. In addition, we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate significant revenues, if at all. Our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to risks related to flaws in our algorithms and datasets that may be insufficient or contain biased information. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions based on impact to data quality, predictions or analysis such technologies produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\nOur ability to develop, acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties, including those that current and potential competitors, may assert. In addition, our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide\nstandards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from partners or consumers, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems.\nRisks Related to the LoyaltyOne Spinoff\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits we expect to achieve from the spinoff.\nIn November 2021, we completed the spinoff of our LoyaltyOne segment, consisting of its Canadian AIR MILES\u00ae Reward Program and Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty businesses, into an independent, publicly traded company, Loyalty Ventures Inc. Although we believe that the spinoff will enhance our long-term value, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation of our businesses, and the spinoff may adversely affect our business. Separating the businesses resulted in two independent, publicly traded companies, each of which is now a smaller, less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the spinoff, which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions. Additionally, a potential loss of synergies from separating the businesses could negatively impact the balance sheet, profit margins or earnings of both businesses and the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies may not be equal to or greater than the value of Alliance Data\u2019s common stock had the spinoff not occurred. We currently hold 19% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Loyalty Ventures Inc., and the value of these shares is dependent upon the current and future performance of Loyalty Ventures Inc. We cannot guarantee that Loyalty Ventures Inc. will be successful as a standalone company, and Loyalty Ventures Inc.\u2019s performance remains subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the other risks described in Loyalty Ventures Inc.\u2019s filings with the SEC, including its registration statement on Form 10 filed with the SEC in connection with the spinoff. Most recently, for example, Loyalty Ventures Inc. noted in its quarterly earnings release for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that, based on its preliminary results, it was recognizing a non-cash, goodwill impairment charge of $50 million in connection with the ongoing impact of COVID-19. Any such current or future impairment charges or other results or circumstances that adversely impact Loyalty Ventures Inc. will in turn adversely impact the value of our ownership position in Loyalty Ventures Inc. While we intend to divest this position in a tax-efficient manner (i.e., in a debt-for-equity exchange within one year of the completion of the spinoff), there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in a tax-efficient manner or at a price that is attractive to us. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the spinoff, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe LoyaltyOne spinoff could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.\nWe received an opinion from our tax advisor confirming that the spinoff of our LoyaltyOne segment qualifies as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes for us and our stockholders (except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares), and we also received a private letter ruling, or PLR, from the Internal Revenue Service to this effect. However, if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinion or the PLR are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, we may not be able to rely on the same. Furthermore, the opinion from our tax advisor is not binding on the IRS or the courts. If, notwithstanding receipt of the opinion from our tax advisor and the PLR, the spinoff transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spinoff transaction is taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of Loyalty Ventures Inc. in connection with the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.\nEven if the spinoff otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution would be taxable to us (but not to our stockholders) in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of Loyalty Ventures Inc. are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff. In this event, the resulting tax liability could be substantial. In connection with the spinoff, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Loyalty Ventures Inc., pursuant to which Loyalty Ventures Inc. agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction. In addition, these potential tax liabilities may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us.\nA director who serves on our Board of Directors also serves as a director of Loyalty Ventures Inc., and ownership of shares of common stock of Loyalty Ventures Inc. by our directors and executive officers may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest.\nA director who serves on our Board of Directors also currently serves on the Board of Directors of Loyalty Ventures Inc. This may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when our or Loyalty Ventures Inc.\u2019s management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Loyalty Ventures Inc., including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the spinoff and our relationship with Loyalty Ventures Inc. or any other commercial agreements entered into in the future between us and Loyalty Ventures Inc.\nSome of our executive officers and non-employee directors currently own shares of the common stock of Loyalty Ventures Inc. The continued ownership of such common stock by our directors and executive officers may create, or may appear to create, a conflict of interest when these directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Loyalty Ventures Inc.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program is designed to ensure that all significant risks are identified, measured, monitored and addressed. Our ERM program defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and reporting. We manage enterprise risk using our Board-approved Enterprise Risk Management Framework, which includes board-level oversight, several risk management committees, and a dedicated risk management team led by our Chief Risk Officer (CRO). Our Board and management manage the level of risk the organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives through well-defined risk appetite statements. We utilize the \"three lines of defense\" risk management model to assign roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk.\nGovernance and Accountability\nBoard and Board Committees\nOur Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, maintains responsibilities for the oversight of risk management, including monitoring the \u201ctone at the top,\u201d and our risk culture and overseeing emerging and strategic risks. While our Board\u2019s Risk Committee has primary responsibility for oversight of enterprise risk management, the Audit, Compensation & Human Capital and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committees also oversee risks within their respective areas of responsibilities. Each of these Board committees consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their Committee meetings.\nRisk Management Roles and Responsibilities\nIn addition to our Board and Board Committees, responsibility for risk management also flows to other individuals and entities throughout the Company, including various management committees and senior management. As defined in our ERM Framework, we utilize the \u201cthree lines of defense\u201d risk management model.\nThe \u201cfirst line of defense\u201d is comprised of the business areas that engage in activities that generate revenue or provide operational support or services that introduce risk to the Company. As the business owner, the first line of defense is responsible for, among other things, identifying, owning, managing and controlling key risks associated with their activities, addressing issues and remediation, and implementing processes and procedures to strengthen the risk and control environment. The first line of defense identifies and manages key performance indicators and risks and controls consistent with the Company\u2019s risk appetite statements. The senior executive officers who serve as leaders in the \"first line of defense,\" are responsible for ensuring that their respective functions operate within established risk limits, in accordance with our risk appetite statements. These leaders are also responsible for identifying risks, considering risk when developing strategic plans, budgets and new products and implementing appropriate risk controls when pursuing business strategies and objectives. In addition, these leaders are responsible for deploying sufficient financial resources and qualified personnel to manage the risks inherent in our business activities.\nThe \u201csecond line of defense\u201d consists of an independent risk management team charged with oversight and monitoring of risk within the business. The second line of defense is responsible for, among other things, implementing our ERM Framework and related policies and procedures, challenging the first line of defense and identifying, monitoring and reporting on aggregate risks of the business and support functions.\nOur risk management team, including compliance, which is led by our CRO, provides oversight of our risk profile and is responsible for maintaining a compliance program that includes compliance risk assessment, policy development, testing and reporting activities.\nThe CRO manages our risk management team and is responsible for establishing and implementing standards for the identification, management, measurement, monitoring and reporting of risk on an enterprise-wide basis. The CRO has responsibility for developing an appropriate risk appetite with corresponding limits that aligns with supervisory expectations, and presenting our risk appetite statements to the Board of Directors. The CRO regularly reports to the Risk Committee as well as the Bank Risk and Compliance Committees on risk management matters.\nThe \u201cthird line of defense\u201d is comprised of the Global Audit organization. The third line of defense provides an independent review and objective assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of the first and second lines of defense governance, policies, procedures, processes and internal controls and reports its findings to senior management\nand the Board through the Audit Committee. Global Audit is responsible for performing periodic, independent reviews and testing compliance with the Company\u2019s and the Banks\u2019 risk management policies and standards, as well as with regulatory guidance and industry best practices. Global Audit also assesses the design of the Company's and the Banks\u2019 policies and standards and validates the effectiveness of risk management controls, and reports the results of such reviews to the Audit Committee.\nManagement Committees\nThe Company operates several internal management committees, including a Bank Risk Management Committee (BRMC) at each of our Banks. The BRMCs are the highest-level management committees to oversee risks and are responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and making recommendations on the Banks\u2019 and its affiliates\u2019 risk appetite. The BRMCs monitor compliance with limits and related escalation requirements and oversee implementation of risk policies.\nIn addition to the BRMCs, we maintain the following management risk committees at each of our Banks to oversee the risks listed below: the Credit Risk Management Committee; Compliance Risk Management Committee; Operational Risk Management Committee; Model Risk Management Committee; and the Asset & Liability Management Committee. Each of these committees is responsible for one or more of the Banks\u2019 eight risk categories. For its risk category(ies) of responsibility, each committee provides risk governance, risk oversight and monitoring. Each committee reviews key risk exposures, trends and significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on steps to monitor, control and escalate significant risks. We include the risk information provided by the BRMCs and these management committees, along with additional risk information that is identified at the ADSC parent company level in our determination and assessment of the risks that are presented to and discussed with our Board and the relevant Board Committees.\nRisk Categories\nWe have divided risk into the following eight categories: credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, model, strategic and reputational risk. We evaluate the potential impact of a risk event on us (including our subsidiaries) by assessing the partner and customer, financial, reputational, and legal and regulatory impacts.\nCredit Risk\nCredit Risk is the risk arising from an obligor\u2019s failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit Risk is found in all activities in which settlement or repayment depends on counterparty, issuer, or borrower performance.\nWe are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card, installment or other loans we make to our partners\u2019 or Bank customers. Our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label, co-brand, general purpose or business credit cards or installment or other loans that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card, installment or other loan balances. To minimize our risk of credit card, installment or other loan charge-offs, we have developed automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures to make risk-based origination decisions when approving new accountholders, establishing or adjusting their credit limits and applying our risk-based pricing. The credit risk on our credit card, installment or other loans is quantified through our Allowance for credit losses which is recorded net with Credit card and other loans on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMarket Risk\nMarket Risk includes interest rate risk which is the risk arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (repricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting an organization\u2019s activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options embedded in certain products (options risk). Our principal market risk exposures arise from volatility in interest rates and their impact on economic value, capitalization levels and earnings. We use various market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our Net interest income. The approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis, which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business. This approach calculates the impact on Net interest income from an instantaneous and sustained 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. Due to the mix of fixed and floating rate assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet as of December 31, 2021, this hypothetical instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have an insignificant impact on our annual Net interest income. Actual changes in our Net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in interest rates. Market risk is managed by the Asset & Liability Management Committee.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity Risk is the risk arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due. Liquidity Risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity Risk also results from an organization\u2019s failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions. The primary liquidity objective is to maintain a liquidity profile that will enable us, even in times of stress or market disruption, to fund our existing assets and meet liabilities in a timely manner and at an acceptable cost. Policy and risk appetite limits require the Company and the Banks to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are available to survive liquidity stresses over a specified time period. The Asset & Liability Management Committee reviews liquidity exposures in the context of approved policy and risk appetite limits and reports results quarterly.\nOperational Risk\nOperational Risk is the risk arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses result from internal fraud; external fraud; inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety; failure to meet professional obligations involving partners, products, and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and systems failures; and/or failures in execution, delivery, and process management.\nOperational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties. The Company has implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy. The Operational Risk Management Committee, chaired by our Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls.\nAs part of our Operational Risk program, we maintain an information and cyber security program, which is led by our Chief Information Security Officer and is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology, a well-staffed and highly trained team of experts, and robust operations based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. This consists of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents. We continue to invest in enhancements to cyber security capabilities and engage in industry and government forums to promote advancements to the broader financial services cyber security ecosystem.\nCompliance Risk\nCompliance Risk is the risk arising from violations of laws or regulations, or from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards. This risk exposes organizations to fines, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. Our Compliance organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed. The Compliance Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for identifying, evaluating, managing, and escalating compliance risks.\nModel Risk\nModel Risk is the risk arising from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Model risk occurs primarily for three reasons: (1) a model may have fundamental errors and produce inaccurate outputs when viewed against its design objective and intended business uses; (2) a model may be used incorrectly or inappropriately or there may be a misunderstanding about its limitations and assumptions; or (3) the model produces results that are not compliant with fair lending or other regulations.\nWe manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework, including policies and procedures for model development, maintenance and performance monitoring activities, independent model validation and change management capabilities. We also assess model performance on an ongoing basis. Model Risk oversight is conducted by the Model Risk Management Committee.\nStrategic Risk\nStrategic Risk is the risk arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the industry and operating environment. This risk is a function of an organization\u2019s strategic goals, business strategies, resources, and quality of implementation. Strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with our Company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders.\nReputational Risk\nReputational Risk is the risk arising from negative public opinion. This risk may impair an organizations competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services or continue servicing existing relationships. Reputational Risk is inherent in all activities and requires management to exercise caution in dealing with stakeholders, such as customers, counterparties, correspondents, investors, regulators, employees, and the community. Our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed.", "PERMNO": 89002, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "ADS"}
