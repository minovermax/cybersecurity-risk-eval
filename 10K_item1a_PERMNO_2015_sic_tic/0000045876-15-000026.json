{"cik": "45876", "company": "HARSCO CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSet forth below are risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. The risks set forth below are not the only risks the Company faces. The Company's business operations could also be affected by other factors not presently known to the Company or factors that the Company currently does not consider to be material.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of market risks, economic uncertainties and potential disruptions of its access to credit.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is routinely subjected to a variety of market risks. In addition to the risk associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, other examples of market risk facing the Company include customer concentration in the Harsco Metals & Minerals and Harsco Rail Segments; the collectability of receivables; the volatility of financial markets and their effect on customer liquidity and defined benefit pension plans; and global economic and political conditions.\nFrom time to time, disruption in the credit markets has severely restricted access to capital for many companies. When credit markets deteriorate, the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations or refinance maturing obligations as they become due may be constrained. This risk could be exacerbated by further deterioration in the Company's credit ratings. The Company is unable to predict any duration or severity of disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions. While these conditions have not impaired the Company's ability to access credit markets and finance operations, a deterioration of economic conditions could materially and adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.\nNegative economic conditions may adversely impact demand for the Company's products and services, as well as the ability of the Company's customers to meet their obligations to the Company on a timely basis. Any disputes with customers could also have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\nTightening of credit in financial markets may lead businesses to postpone spending, which may impact the Company's customers, causing them to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with the Company. Declines in economic conditions may further impact the ability of the Company's customers to meet their obligations to the Company on a timely basis and could result in bankruptcy or receivership filings by any of such customers. If customers are unable to meet their obligations on a timely basis, or if the Company is unable to collect amounts due from customers for any reason, it could adversely impact the realizability of receivables, the valuation of inventories and the valuation of long-lived assets across the Company's businesses. Furthermore, some of the Company's significant customers may be subject to acquisitions and/or consolidations that negatively impact their ability to meet their obligations to the Company on a timely basis, or at all. Additionally, the Company may be negatively affected by contractual disputes with customers, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Company cannot generate future cash flows at a level sufficient to recover the net book value of any of reporting units, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge to earnings.\nAs a result of the Company's goodwill impairment testing, the Company may be required to record future impairment charges to the extent it cannot generate future cash flows at a level sufficient to recover the net book value of any of the Company's reporting units. For example, as a result of the October 1, 2012 annual goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a $265.0 million goodwill impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the Harsco Infrastructure Segment. At December 31, 2014, almost all of the Company's goodwill is allocated to the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, which is included in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment. The Company's estimates of fair value are based on assumptions about the future operating cash flows and growth rates of each reporting unit and discount rates applied to these cash flows. Based on the uncertainty of future growth rates, restructuring savings and other assumptions used to estimate goodwill recoverability, future reductions in the Company's expected cash flows could cause a material non-cash goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's global presence subjects it to a variety of risks arising from doing business internationally.\nThe Company operates in approximately 35 countries, including the United States. The Company's global footprint exposes it to a variety of risks that may adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. These include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nperiodic economic downturns in the countries in which the Company does business;\n\u2022\nimposition of or increases in currency exchange controls and hard currency shortages;\n\u2022\ncustoms matters and changes in trade policy or tariff regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company does business;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax regulations, higher tax rates in certain jurisdictions and potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on repatriating earnings, adverse tax withholding requirements and \"double taxation\";\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ncomplexities in complying with a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical, economic and social instability, civil and political unrest, terrorist actions and armed hostilities in the regions or countries in which the Company does business;\n\u2022\ninflation rates in the countries in which the Company does business;\n\u2022\ncomplying with complex labor laws in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nlaws in various international jurisdictions that limit the right and ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends and remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met;\n\u2022\nsovereign risk related to international governments that include, but may not be limited to, governments stopping interest payments or repudiating their debt, nationalizing private businesses or altering foreign exchange regulations; and\n\u2022\nuncertainties arising from local business practices, cultural considerations and international political and trade tensions.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with its global business, the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be negatively impacted.\nThe Company has operations in several countries in the Middle East, including Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman, as well as India and Pakistan, some of which have recently experienced armed hostilities and civil unrest. Additionally, these countries are geographically close to other countries that may have a continued high risk of armed hostilities or civil unrest.\nExchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact the Company's business.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the approximately 25 other currencies in which the Company currently conducts business may adversely impact the Company's results of operations in any given fiscal period. Approximately 17% and 25% of the Company's revenues were derived from operations where the Euro is the functional currency in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and approximately 12% of the Company's revenues were derived from operations in the United Kingdom during both 2014 and 2013. Furthermore, approximately 7% and 5% of the Company's revenues were derived from operations in Brazil for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company's principal foreign currency exposures are in the European Economic and Monetary Union, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Given the structure of the Company's operations, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which the Company earns its revenues, generally has a negative impact on the translated amounts of the assets and liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company's foreign currency exposures increase the risk of volatility in its consolidated financial statements. If currencies in the below regions change materially in relation to the U.S. dollar, the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially affected.\nCompared with the corresponding full-year period in 2013, the average value of major currencies changed as follows in relation to the U.S. Dollar during the full-year 2014, impacting the Company's revenues and income:\n\u2022\nBritish pound sterling strengthened by 5%\n\u2022\neuro weakened by 1%\n\u2022\nBrazilian real weakened by 7%\nCompared with exchange rates at December 31, 2013, the value of major currencies at December 31, 2014 changed as follows:\n\u2022\nBritish pound sterling weakened by 6%\n\u2022\neuro weakened by 12%\n\u2022\nBrazilian real weakened by 11%\nTo illustrate the effect of foreign exchange rate changes in certain key markets of the Company, in 2014 revenues would have been approximately 1% or $20.0 million higher and operating income would have been approximately 3% or $2.2 million greater if the average exchange rates for 2013 were utilized. In a similar comparison for 2013, revenues would have been approximately 1% or $21.6 million higher and operating loss would have been approximately 2% or $2.8 million greater if the average exchange rates for 2012 were utilized.\nCurrency changes also result in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into U.S. dollars at different amounts than at the prior period end. Generally, if the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to currencies in countries in which the Company does business, the translated amounts of the related assets and liabilities, and therefore stockholders' equity, would increase. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to currencies in countries in which the Company does business, the translated amounts of the related assets, liabilities, and therefore stockholders' equity, would decrease.\nAlthough the Company engages in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and other hedging strategies to mitigate foreign exchange transactional risks, hedging strategies may not be successful or may fail to completely offset these risks.\nIn addition, competitive conditions in the Company's manufacturing businesses may limit the Company's ability to increase product prices in the face of adverse currency movement. Sales of products manufactured in the United States for the domestic and export markets may be affected by the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. Any long-term strengthening of the U.S. dollar could depress demand for these products and reduce sales. Conversely, any long-term weakening of the U.S. dollar could improve demand for these products and increase sales.\nCyclical industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the Company's businesses.\nThe Company's businesses are subject to general economic slowdowns and cyclical conditions in each of the industries served. In particular:\n\u2022\nThe Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment may be adversely impacted by slowdowns in steel mill production, excess capacity, consolidation, bankruptcy or receivership of steel producers or a reversal or slowing of current outsourcing trends in the steel industry;\n\u2022\nThe resource recovery technologies business of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment may be adversely impacted by slowdowns in customer production or a reduction in the selling prices of its materials, which are market-based and vary based upon the current fair value of the components being sold. Therefore, the revenue generated from the sale of such recycled materials varies based upon the fair value of the commodity components being sold;\n\u2022\nThe industrial abrasives and roofing granules business of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment may be adversely impacted by reduced home resales or economic conditions that slow the rate of residential roof replacement, or by slowdowns in the industrial and infrastructure refurbishment industries;\n\u2022\nThe Harsco Rail Segment may be adversely impacted by developments in the railroad industry that lead to lower capital spending or reduced track maintenance spending;\n\u2022\nThe air-cooled heat exchangers business of the Harsco Industrial Segment is affected by cyclical conditions in the natural gas, natural gas processing and petrochemical industries. Therefore, a slowdown in natural gas and petrochemical drilling or production could adversely affect this business;\n\u2022\nDecreasing oil prices may adversely impact purchasing by energy sector customers in the Harsco Industrial Segment;\n\u2022\nThe industrial grating products business of the Harsco Industrial Segment may be adversely impacted by slowdowns in non-residential construction and industrial production; and\n\u2022\nCapital constraints and increased borrowing costs may also adversely impact the financial position and operations of the Company's customers across all business segments.\nFurthermore, realization of deferred tax assets is ultimately dependent on generating sufficient income in future periods to ensure recovery of those assets. The cyclicality of the Company's end markets and adverse economic conditions may negatively impact the future income levels that are necessary for the utilization of deferred tax assets.\nThe seasonality of the Company's business may cause its quarterly results to fluctuate.\nThe Company has historically generated the majority of its cash flows provided by operations in the second half of the year. This is a result of normally higher income during the second half of the year, as the Company's business tends to follow seasonal patterns. If the Company is unable to successfully manage the cash flow and other effects of seasonality on the business, its results of operations may suffer.\nThe Company may lose customers or be required to reduce prices as a result of competition.\nThe industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive:\n\u2022\nThe Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment is sustained mainly through contract renewals and new contract signings. The Company may be unable to renew contracts at historical price levels or to obtain additional contracts at historical rates as a result of competition. If the Company is unable to renew its contracts at the historical rates or renewals are at reduced prices, revenue and results of operations may decline. Additionally, the Company has elected not to renew certain underperforming contracts in an effort to improve overall profitability. This has a negative impact on revenues, but ultimately improves overall operating margins. The Company will continue to evaluate contracts in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, which may adversely affect revenues.\n\u2022\nThe Harsco Rail and Harsco Industrial Segments compete with companies that manufacture similar products both internationally and domestically. Certain international competitors export their products into the United States and sell them at lower prices due to lower labor costs and government subsidies for exports. Such practices may limit the prices the Company can charge for its products and services. Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange rates can adversely impact the Company's ability to match the prices charged by international competitors. If the Company is unable to match the prices charged by international competitors, it may lose customers.\nIncreased customer concentration and related credit and commercial risks may adversely impact the Company's future earnings and cash flows.\nThe Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment and, to a lesser extent, the Harsco Rail Segment have several large customers throughout the world with significant accounts receivable balances. Consolidation in the global steel industry has occurred in recent years and additional consolidation is possible. Should additional transactions occur involving some of the steel or rail industry's larger companies that are customers of the Company, it would result in an increase in concentration of credit risk for the Company. If a large customer were to experience financial difficulty, or file for bankruptcy or receivership protection, or if the Company were unable to collect amounts due from customers that are currently under bankruptcy or receivership protection, it could adversely impact the Company's results of operations, cash flows and asset valuations.\nThe Company's businesses may be negatively affected by disputes with customers, including its major customers. The Company is currently party to multiple contracts in numerous countries with its largest customer, ArcelorMittal. These contracts cover a variety of services. From time to time, the Company may be negotiating the terms of current and potential future services to be rendered due to the scope and complexity of this relationship. Disagreements between the parties can arise as a result of the scope and nature of the relationship and these ongoing negotiations. The Company cannot predict whether such disputes will arise in the future and whether such conflicts will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and legal developments involving income taxes.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal, U.S. state and international income, payroll, property, sales and use, value-added, fuel and other types of taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's worldwide provisions for income taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactments of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes, and therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Currently, a majority of the Company's revenue is generated from customers located outside the United States, and a substantial portion of the Company's assets and employees are located outside the United States. U.S. income tax and international withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries as such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.\nAny U.S. tax reform that reduces the Company's ability to defer U.S. taxes on earnings indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States could have a negative impact on the Company's ability to compete in the global marketplace. Recently, the Administration proposed a 14% current tax on all undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. based companies. If enacted, this proposal could materially affect the Company\u2019s reported earnings and cash flows and impact the Company\u2019s ability to compete abroad. The Company will continue to monitor tax legislation to be in a position to fully understand its potential impact on the Company\u2019s operations and to plan accordingly.\nThe Company's defined benefit net periodic pension cost is directly affected by the equity and bond markets, and a downward trend in those markets could adversely impact the Company's results of operations.\nIn addition to the economic issues that directly affect the Company's businesses, changes in the performance of equity and bond markets, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States, impact actuarial assumptions used in determining annual net periodic pension cost, pension liabilities and the valuation of the assets in the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Financial market deterioration would most likely have a negative impact on the Company's net periodic pension cost and the pension assets and liabilities. This could result in a decrease to stockholders' equity and an increase in the Company's statutory funding requirements.\nThe Company's results of operations may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense the Company records for defined benefit pension plans. The Company calculates income or expense for the defined benefit pension plans using actuarial valuations that reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. The most significant assumptions used to estimate defined benefit pension income or expense for the upcoming year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions. If there are significant changes in key economic indicators, the impact of these assumptions may materially affect the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. These key economic indicators would also likely affect the amount of cash the Company would contribute to the defined benefit pension plans.\nThe Company's Pension Committee continues to evaluate alternative strategies to further reduce overall net periodic pension cost, including: conversion of certain remaining defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans; the ongoing evaluation of investment fund managers' performance; the balancing of plan assets and liabilities; the risk assessment of multiemployer pension plans; the possible merger of certain plans; the consideration of incremental voluntary cash contributions to certain plans; and other changes that are likely to reduce future net periodic pension cost volatility and minimize risk.\nIn addition to the Company's defined benefit pension plans, the Company also participates in numerous multiemployer pension plans throughout the world. Within the United States, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 may require additional funding for multiemployer plans that could cause the Company to be subject to higher cash contributions in the future. Additionally, market conditions and the number of participating employers remaining in each plan may affect the funded status of multiemployer plans and consequently any Company withdrawal liability, if applicable. The Company continues to monitor and assess any full and partial withdrawal liability implications associated with these plans.\nFurther downgrades in the Company's credit ratings could increase the Company's cost of borrowing and could adversely affect the Company's future earnings and ability to access the capital markets.\nThe Company's cost of borrowing and ability to access capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to the Company's debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in part, on the Company's financial position and liquidity as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.\nDuring 2013, the major credit rating agencies lowered the credit ratings assigned to the Company to non-investment grade; this in turn increased the Company's cost of borrowing under its credit facility. Additional rating downgrades may further increase the Company's cost of borrowing and could adversely affect the Company's ability to access the capital markets and issue additional debt at rates acceptable to the Company. Any increased borrowing costs or an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, liquidity and cash flows.\nRestrictions imposed by the Company's outstanding notes and credit facility may limit the Company's ability to obtain additional financing or to pursue business opportunities.\nThe Company\u2019s 5.75% and 2.7% notes include covenants that require the Company to offer to repurchase the notes at 101% of par in the event of a change of control of the Company or disposition of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets in combination with a downgrade in the Company\u2019s credit rating to non-investment grade. The Company\u2019s credit facility contains covenants that stipulate a maximum total consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") ratio of 3.5 to 1.0, limit the proportion of subsidiary consolidated indebtedness to a maximum of 10% of consolidated tangible assets, and specify a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charges of 3.0 to 1.0. These covenants limit the amount of debt the Company may incur, which could limit the Company's ability to obtain additional financing or pursue business opportunities. In addition, the Company's ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond its control. A breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the credit facility. In the event of any default under the credit facility, the lenders under the facility could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, which would cause an event of default under the credit facility. This could, in turn, trigger an event of default under the cross-default provisions of the Company's other outstanding indebtedness.\nFailure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under committed credit facility and derivative financial instruments may adversely affect the Company's future earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company has a committed revolving credit facility with financial institutions available for its use, for which the Company pays commitment fees. The credit facility is provided by a syndicate of several financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to the Company in accordance with the terms of the related credit agreement. If one or more of the financial institutions providing the committed credit facility were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment, the portion of the committed facility provided by such defaulting financial institution would not be available to the Company.\nThe Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps in conjunction with certain debt issuances in order to secure either a fixed or floating local currency interest rate. The Company has foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding as part of a worldwide program to minimize foreign currency operating income and balance sheet exposure. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts are used to hedge commitments, such as foreign currency debt, firm purchase commitments and foreign currency cash flows for certain export sales transactions. The unsecured contracts for cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2014 mature at various times through 2020 and are with major financial institutions. The Company may also enter into derivative contracts to hedge commodity exposures. The Company may be exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts.\nThe failure of a counterparty to fulfill its obligation under the committed credit facility or derivative financial instruments may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe Company's cash flows and earnings are subject to changes in interest rates.\nThe Company's total debt at December 31, 2014 was $871.6 million. Of this amount, approximately 17% had variable rates of interest and approximately 83% had fixed rates of interest. The weighted average interest rate of total debt was 4.6%. At current debt levels, a one percentage point increase/decrease in variable interest rates would increase/decrease interest expense by $1.5 million per year. If the Company is unable to successfully manage its exposure to variable interest rates, its results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, whenever the Company refinances fixed rate debt, the new interest rates may negatively impact the Company's results of operations. The interest rates associated with new fixed rate debt are impacted by several factors including, but not limited to, currency, market conditions, term of the borrowings and the financial results of the Company.\nA negative outcome on personal injury claims against the Company may adversely impact results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has been named as one of many defendants (approximately 90 or more in most cases) in legal actions alleging personal injury from exposure to airborne asbestos over the past several decades. In their suits, the plaintiffs have named as defendants, among others, many manufacturers, distributors and installers of numerous types of equipment or products that allegedly contained asbestos. The majority of the asbestos complaints pending against the Company have been filed in New York. Almost all of the New York complaints contain a standard claim for damages of $20 million or $25 million against the approximately 90 defendants, regardless of the individual plaintiff's alleged medical condition, and without specifically identifying any Company product as the source of plaintiff's asbestos exposure. If the Company is found to be liable in any of these actions and the liability exceeds the Company's insurance coverage, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nHigher than expected claims under insurance policies, under which the Company retains a portion of the risk, could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company retains a significant portion of the risk for property, workers' compensation, U.K. employers' liability, automobile and general and product liability losses. Reserves have been recorded that reflect the undiscounted estimated liabilities for ultimate losses, including claims incurred but not reported. Inherent in these estimates are assumptions that are based on the Company's history of claims and losses, a detailed analysis of existing claims with respect to potential value, and current legal and legislative trends. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had recorded liabilities of $47.9 million and $52.4 million, respectively, related to both asserted and unasserted insurance claims. Included in the balance at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $3.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of recognized liabilities covered by insurance carriers. If actual claims are higher than those projected by management, an increase to the Company's insurance reserves may be required and would be recorded as a charge to income in the period the need for the change was determined. Conversely, if actual claims are lower than those projected by management, a decrease to the Company's insurance reserves may be required and would be recorded as a reduction to expense in the period the need for the change was determined.\nThe Company is subject to various environmental laws, and the success of existing or future environmental claims against it could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of health, safety and the environment, including those governing discharges to air and water, handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials. The Company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for remediation or other costs or damages under these laws. The Company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future, and compliance with more stringent environmental requirements may require the Company to make material expenditures or subject it to liabilities that the Company currently does not anticipate.\nThe Company is currently involved in a number of environmental remediation investigations and cleanups and, along with other companies, has been identified as a \"potentially responsible party\" for certain waste disposal sites under the federal \"Superfund\" law. At several sites, the Company is currently conducting environmental remediation, and it is probable that the Company will agree to make payments toward funding certain other of these remediation activities. It also is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably to the Company and that other sites requiring remediation will be identified. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and financial exposure is dependent upon such factors as the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements; the availability and application of technology; the allocation of cost among potentially responsible parties; the years of remedial activity required; and the remediation methods selected.\nVolatility in energy prices could reduce the Company's profitability.\nThe Company's Air-cooled heat exchangers business manufactures products that are utilized within the energy supply chain. These products are used to support the infrastructure investments or expansions, as well as maintain current output levels, of the Company's customers. Volatility and changes in energy prices, both for natural gas and oil, affect the financial performance of certain of the Company's customers and may impact the demand for the Company's products.\nIncreases or decreases in purchase prices (or selling prices) or availability of steel or other materials and commodities may affect the Company's profitability.\nThe profitability of the Company's manufactured products is affected by changing purchase prices of steel and other materials and commodities. If raw material costs associated with the Company's manufactured products increase and the costs cannot be transferred to the Company's customers, results of operations would be adversely affected. Additionally, decreased availability of steel or other materials could affect the Company's ability to produce manufactured products in a timely manner. If the Company cannot obtain the necessary raw materials for its manufactured products, then revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nCertain services performed by the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment result in the recovery, processing and sale of recovered metals and minerals and other high-value metal by-products to its customers. The selling price of the by-products material is market-based and varies based upon the current fair value of its components. Therefore, the revenue amounts generated from the sale of such by-products material vary based upon the fair value of the commodity components being sold.\nThe Company may not be able to manage and integrate acquisitions successfully.\nIn the past, the Company has acquired businesses and, on an ongoing basis, continues to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen the Company. For example, in January 2014, the Company acquired Hammco Corporation (\"Hammco\"), a provider of process coolers for the natural gas and petrochemical processing industries. The Company can give no assurances that any acquisition opportunities will arise in the future or, if they do, that they will be consummated, or that additional financing or capital, if needed, will be available on satisfactory terms.\nIn addition, acquisitions involve inherent risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with the Company's expectations. The Company may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits that are expected from the integration of acquisitions as successfully or rapidly as projected, if at all. The Company's failure to effectively integrate newly acquired operations, including the operations of Hammco, could prevent the Company from recognizing expected rates of return on an acquired business and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the Company.\nDue to the international nature of the Company's business, the Company could be adversely affected by violations of certain laws.\nThe Company's policies mandate compliance with certain U.S. and international laws, such as import/export regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws. With regard to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws, the Company operates in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. The Company cannot provide assurance that its internal controls and procedures will always prevent reckless or criminal acts by its employees or agents. If the Company is found to be liable for violations of these laws (either due to its own acts, out of inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), the Company could suffer criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including limitations on its ability to conduct its business, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe Company may be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, its cost-cutting initiatives, strategic initiatives, and portfolio optimization initiatives, and this may adversely affect operating results and cash flow.\nAs part of its continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs, the Company has in the past implemented numerous cost-cutting initiatives, strategic initiatives, and portfolio optimization initiatives, including initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of 2013 and throughout 2014. The Company anticipates that it will continue to implement additional initiatives in 2015 and beyond when circumstances warrant. If the Company is unable to achieve, or has any unexpected delays in achieving, the anticipated cost savings and benefits associated with these initiatives, its results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected. Even if the Company meets the goals pursuant to these initiatives, it may not receive the expected financial benefits of these initiatives.\nThe Company\u2019s ongoing operations are subject to extensive laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters that impose significant costs and liabilities on the Company, and future laws and governmental standards could increase these costs and liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations, rules and ordinances regulating the use of certain materials contained in its products and/or used in its manufacturing processes. Many of these laws and governmental standards provide for extensive obligations that require the Company to incur significant compliance costs, and impose substantial monetary fines and/or criminal sanctions for violations. Furthermore, such laws and standards are subject to change and may become more stringent.\nIn particular, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration is reviewing its worker safety standards related to exposure to beryllium, which is a component of Harsco Minerals\u2019 BLACK BEAUTY\u00ae abrasives. Although it is not possible to predict changes in laws or other governmental standards, the development, proposal or adoption of more stringent laws or governmental standards may affect buying decisions by the users of the Company\u2019s products that contain regulated materials or that involve the use of such materials in the manufacturing process. If applicable laws and governmental standards become made more stringent and/or the Company\u2019s customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of its products, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company maintains a workforce based upon current and anticipated workload. If the Company does not receive future contract awards or if these awards are delayed, significant cost may result.\nThe Company's estimates of future performance depend on, among other matters, whether and when the Company will receive certain new contract awards, including the extent to which the Company utilizes its workforce. The rate at which the Company utilizes its workforce is impacted by a variety of factors including the ability to manage attrition; to forecast the need for services, which allows it to maintain an appropriately sized workforce; the ability to transition employees from completed projects to new projects or between segments; and the need to devote resources to non-revenue generating activities such as training or business development. While the Company's estimates are based upon its good faith judgment, these estimates can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information. In the case of large-scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain, it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when the Company will receive a contract award. The uncertainty of contact award timing can present difficulties in matching the Company's workforce size with contract needs. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, the Company could incur cost resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities or equipment that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe success of the Company's strategic ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by strategic venture partners of their strategic venture obligations.\nThe Company enters into various strategic ventures as part of its strategic growth initiatives as well as to comply with local laws. Differences in opinions or views between strategic venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues which could adversely affect the business and operations of the venture. From time to time in order to establish or preserve a relationship, or to better ensure venture success, the Company may accept risks or responsibilities for the strategic venture that are not necessarily proportionate with the reward it expects to receive. The success of these and other strategic ventures also depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance by the Company's strategic venture partners of their strategic venture obligations, including their obligation to commit working capital, equity or credit support as required by the strategic venture and to support their indemnification and other contractual obligations. If the Company's strategic venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their strategic venture obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties, the strategic venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, the Company may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, increased liabilities or significant losses for the Company with respect to the strategic venture. In addition, although the Company generally performs due diligence with regard to potential strategic partners or ventures, a failure by a strategic venture partner to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact its business and, in the case of government contracts, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment. Unexpected strategic venture developments could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company may pursue strategic transactions that it believes will maximize equity returns for stockholders but may involve risk.\nFrom time to time, the Company considers strategic transactions that it believes will maximize stockholder's equity returns over the long-term. For example, in 2013, the Company contributed the Harsco Infrastructure division into a strategic venture with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (\"CD&R\"). These types of transactions, however, also involve risk, including risk relating to the costs associated with such transactions, the loss of cash flows and market positions of disposed businesses, and the possibility that savings anticipated to result from such transactions may not be realized. There can be no guarantee that these transactions, including the strategic venture with CD&R, will result in cost savings, be accretive to the Company's earnings, improve operating margins and return on capital, or ultimately maximize equity returns for the Company's stockholders.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to the Company's systems, networks, products and services.\nThe Company relies upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties. Additionally, the Company collects and stores data that is of a sensitive nature. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to the Company's business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats - from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to the Company's systems, networks and data - are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of the Company's systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company's data. Should an attack on the Company's information technology systems and networks succeed it could expose the Company and the Company's employees, customers, dealers and suppliers to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operations disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect the Company's reputation, competitive position, business and results of operations. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nThe Company's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing similar or duplicative products and services.\nThe Company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling similar or duplicative products and services, and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by the Company to protect the Company's intellectual property will be sufficient or that the Company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the Company's technology. The Company could also face competition in some countries where the Company has not invested in an intellectual property portfolio. The Company may also face attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Company's IT systems or products for the purpose of improperly acquiring trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of the Company's trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect the Company's competitive position and the value of the Company's investment in research and development. The Company may be unable to secure or retain ownership or rights to use data in certain software analytics or services offerings. In addition, the Company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. If the Company is found to infringe any third-party rights, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages or could be enjoined from offering some of the Company's products and services. Also, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses needed in the future, and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms.\nUnion disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.\nSome of the Company's employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with the Company's employees will be resolved or that the Company will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or the Company's employees. The Company may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. If the Company fails to renegotiate existing collective bargaining agreements, the Company could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at the Company's facilities in the future. The Company may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to the Company's business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at the Company's facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of the Company's customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by the Company's customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 25304, "SIC": 3390, "TIC": "HSC"}
