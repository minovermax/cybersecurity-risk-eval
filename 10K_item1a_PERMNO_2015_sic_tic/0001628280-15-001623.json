{"cik": "919013", "company": "WAVE SYSTEMS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the unprecedented economic and market conditions.\nThe U.S. and numerous other leading markets around the world continue to experience slow recoveries or more challenging economic conditions, and we believe meaningful risk remains of returned deterioration in economic conditions and of substantial and continuing financial market disruptions in certain large economies. Conditions in the global financial markets and economic and geopolitical conditions throughout the world are outside of our control and difficult to predict, being influenced by factors such as national and international political circumstances (including governmental instability, wars, terrorist acts or security operations), interest rates, market volatility, asset or market correlations, equity prices, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws or regulation including as regards taxation, trade barriers, commodity prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and controls. While many governments, including the U.S. federal government, have taken substantial steps to stabilize economic conditions in an effort to increase liquidity and capital availability, if economic conditions should weaken, the business environment in our principal markets would be adversely affected, which may negatively impact, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe continued growth and development of our business;\n\u2022\nour liquidity;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise capital and obtain financing; and\n\u2022\nthe price of our common stock.\nWe have a history of net losses and expect net losses will continue. If we continue to operate at a loss our business will not be financially viable.\nWe have experienced significant losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception. We have not realized a net operating profit in any quarter since we began our operations. Wave's revenue in 2014 was less than operating expenses as\nour products have not yet attained widespread commercial acceptance. This is due in part to the early stage nature of our products with respect to the digital security industry in which we operate. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $430.1 million and negative working capital of approximately $5.0 million. Given the lack of widespread adoption of the technology for our products and services, there is little basis for evaluating the financial viability of our business and our long-term prospects. You should consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties that companies in their early stage of development encounter, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as digital security.\nTo achieve profitability we must, among other things:\n\u2022\ncontinue to convince chip, personal computer motherboard, personal computer and computer peripheral manufacturers to license and distribute our products and services and/or make them available to their customers through their sales channels;\n\u2022\nconvince computer end users and enterprise computer customers to purchase our upgrade software and server products for trusted computing;\n\u2022\nconvince consumers to choose to order, purchase and accept products using our products and services;\n\u2022\ncontinue to maintain the necessary resources, especially talented software programmers;\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop relationships with personal computer manufacturers, computer chip manufacturers and computer systems integrators to facilitate and to maximize acceptance of our products and services; and\n\u2022\ngenerate substantial revenue, complete one or more commercial or strategic transactions or raise additional capital to support our operations until we can generate sufficient revenues and cash flows.\nIf we do not succeed in these objectives we will not generate revenues; hence our business will not be sustainable.\nWe may be unable to raise or generate the additional financing or cash flow which will be necessary to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months.\nSince we began our operations we have incurred net losses and experienced significant negative cash flow from operations. This is due to the early stage nature of market development for our products and services and the digital security industry as a whole. Wave expects to continue to incur substantial additional expenses associated with continued research and development and business development activities that will be necessary to commercialize our technology. We may be unable to raise or generate the additional financing or cash flow which will be necessary to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months.\nIn addition to our efforts to generate revenue sufficient to fund our operations, or complete one or more commercial or strategic transactions, Wave may evaluate additional financing options to generate additional capital in order to continue as a going concern, to capitalize on business opportunities and market conditions and to insure the continued development of our technology, products and services. We do not know if additional financing will be available or that, if available, it will be available on favorable terms. If we issue additional shares of our stock our stockholders' ownership will be diluted and the shares issued may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. In addition, if we pursue debt financing we will be required to pay interest costs. The failure to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our forecasted expenditures would require us to reduce our cash burn rate which would in turn impede our ability to achieve our business objectives. Even if we are successful in raising additional capital, uncertainty with respect to Wave's viability will continue until we are successful in achieving our objectives. Furthermore, although we may be successful at achieving our business objectives, a positive cash flow from operations may not ultimately be realized unless we are able to sell our products and services at a profit. Given the early stage nature of the markets for our products and services considerable uncertainty exists as to whether or not Wave's business model is viable. If we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow or obtaining additional funding we may be unable to continue our operations, develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. Due to our current cash position, our forecasted capital needs over the next twelve months and beyond, the fact that we will require additional financing and uncertainty as to whether we will achieve our sales forecast for our products and services, substantial doubt exists with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nA single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues and, therefore, the loss of that customer may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Dell accounted for approximately 32% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, as discussed below. Barring another royalty agreement with Dell, we anticipate that this Dell royalty revenue will continue to decline until it terminates completely. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and beyond, the Company will attempt to mitigate the loss of Dell revenue by, among other things, increasing sales to large enterprise customers and engaging other OEM customers in long-term licensing and distribution agreements.\nIf our relationship with any of our significant customers were disrupted we could lose a significant portion of our anticipated revenues which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as discussed below.\nFactors that could influence our relationships with our customers include, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to sell our products at prices that are competitive with our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain features and quality standards for our products sufficient to meet the expectations of our customers; and\n\u2022\nour ability to produce and deliver a sufficient quantity of our products in a timely manner to meet our customers' requirements.\nIf our OEM customers fail to purchase our components or to sell sufficient quantities of their products incorporating our components or if our OEM customers' sales timing and volume fluctuates, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn general, our ability to make sales to OEM customers depends on our ability to compete on price, delivery and quality. The timing and volume of these sales depend upon the sales levels and shipping schedules for the products into which our OEM customers incorporate our products. Thus, even if we develop a successful component, our sales will not increase unless the product into which our component is incorporated is successful. If our OEM customers decide not to incorporate our products as components of their products or fail to sell a sufficient quantity of products incorporating our components, or if the OEM customers' sales timing and volume fluctuate, it may lead to a reduction in our sales and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSales to a relatively small number of OEM customers, as opposed to direct retail sales to end customers, comprised a significant portion of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. Dell accounted for approximately 32% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. From time to time Dell updates its hardware platforms with new security solutions packages. Our bundled software has been included on Dell platforms since 2006 with the Dell Data Protection Access solution (DDPA). On March 15, 2013, Dell notified us that it will be replacing the DDPA solution in its next generation of client hardware platforms that began shipping in late 2013. As it has with other solution upgrades since 2006, Dell has also informed us that it will continue to discuss with Wave opportunities to include our software on future Dell platforms. However, Dell has not communicated to us any decisions regarding future platforms and we have no assurance that our software will be included in Dell's future platforms. We anticipate that our royalty revenue received from Dell will continue to decline as the Dell platforms that include Wave software decrease in shipping volume. For each of the three-months ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2014, Dell royalty revenue declined quarter over quarter as we had anticipated. Barring another royalty agreement with Dell, we anticipate that this Dell royalty revenue will continue to decline until it terminates completely. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and beyond, the Company will attempt to mitigate the loss of Dell revenue by, among other things, increasing sales to large enterprise customers and engaging other OEM customers in long-term licensing and distribution agreements.\nOur market is in the early stage of development so we are unable to accurately ascertain the size and growth potential for revenue in such a market.\nThe market for our products and services is still developing and is continually evolving. As a result, substantial uncertainty exists with respect to the size of the market for these products and the level of capital that will be required to meet the evolving technical requirements of the marketplace.\nWave's business model relies on an assumed market of tens of millions of units shipping with built-in security hardware. Because this market remains in the early stage of development there is significant uncertainty with respect to the validity of the future size of the market. If the market for computer systems that utilize our products and services does not grow to the extent necessary for us to realize our business plan, we may not be successful.\nAs this early stage market develops and evolves, significant capital will likely be required to fund the resources needed to meet the changing technological demands of the marketplace. There is uncertainty with respect to the level of capital that may\nbe required to meet these changing technological demands. If the amount of capital resources needed exceeds our ability to obtain such capital, we may not be a viable enterprise.\nWave is not established in the industry so we may not be accepted as a supplier or service provider to the market.\nWave's product offering represents a highly complex architecture designed to solve many of the security issues currently present with computer systems such as identity theft, fraudulent transactions, virus attacks, unauthorized access to restricted networks and other security problems that users of computer systems generally encounter. We are uncertain as to whether the marketplace will accept our solution to these security problems. We will not be successful if the market does not accept the value proposition that we perceive to be present in our products and services.\nAlthough Wave has expended considerable resources in developing technology and products that utilize our technology and in business development activities in an attempt to drive the development of the hardware security market, we do not have a track record as a substantial supplier or service provider to consumers of computer systems. Therefore, uncertainty remains as to whether we will be accepted as a supplier to the enterprise and consumer markets which will likely be necessary for us to be a successful commercial enterprise.\nOur products have not been accepted as industry standards which may slow their sales growth.\nWe believe platforms adopting integrated hardware security into the PC will become a significant standard feature in the overall PC marketplace. However, our technologies have not been accepted as industry standards. Standards for trusted computing are still evolving. To be successful we must obtain acceptance of our technologies as industry standards, modify our products and services to meet whatever industry standards ultimately develop and/or adapt our products to be complementary to whatever these standards become. If we fail to do any of these we will not be successful in commercializing our technology; and therefore, we will not generate sales to fund our operations and develop into a self-sustaining, profitable business.\nIf we do not keep up with technological changes our product development and business growth will suffer.\nBecause the market in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology, changes in customer requirements, frequent new products, service introductions and enhancements and emerging industry standards, our success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to improve our products, develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with technological developments, remain compatible with changing computer system platforms, respond to evolving customer requirements and achieve market acceptance on a timely and cost effective basis. If we do not identify, develop, manufacture, market and support new products and deploy new services effectively and timely our business will not grow, our financial results will suffer and we may not have the ability to remain in business.\nWe are subject to risks relating to potential security breaches of our software products.\nAlthough we have implemented in our products various security mechanisms, our products and services may nevertheless be vulnerable to break-ins, piracy and similar disruptive problems caused by Internet users. Any of these disruptions would harm our business. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of security or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect products and information in electronic form. Computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the computer systems of users of our products which may result in significant liability to us and may also deter potential customers.\nA party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary electronic content or cause interruptions in our operations and those of our strategic partners. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Our attempts to implement contracts that limit our liability to our customers, including liability arising from a failure of security features contained in our products and services, may not be enforceable. We currently do not have product liability insurance to protect against these risks. If the security of products or services is breached, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected by the liability resulting from the breach.\nCompetition and competing technologies may render some or all of our products non-competitive or obsolete.\nAn increasing number of market entrants have introduced or are developing products and services that compete with Wave's. Our competitors may be able to develop products and services that are more attractive to customers than our products and services. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Also, many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and larger customer bases that could be leveraged to enable them to gain market share or product acceptance to our detriment. Wave's potential competitors include security solutions providers such as WinMagic, RSA Security, Inc., Sophos, Symantec, McAfee, SafeNet, Softex, Entrust, Inc. and Absolute Software.\nOther companies have developed or are developing technologies that are, or may become, the basis for competitive products in the field of security and electronic content distribution. Some of those technologies may have an approach or means of processing that is entirely different from ours. Existing or new competitors may develop products that are superior to ours or that otherwise achieve greater market acceptance than ours. Due to Wave's early stage and lower relative name recognition compared to many of our competitors and potential competitors, our competitive position in the marketplace is vulnerable.\nWe have a high dependence on relationships with strategic partners that must continue or our ability to successfully produce and market our products will be impaired.\nDue in large part to Wave's early stage and lesser name recognition we depend upon strategic partners such as large, well established personal computer and semiconductor manufacturers and computer systems' integrators to adopt our products and services within the marketplace. These companies may choose not to use our products and could develop or market products or technologies that compete directly with us. We cannot predict whether these third parties will commit the resources necessary to achieve broad-based commercial acceptance of our technology. Any delay in the use of our technology by these partners could impede or prohibit the commercial acceptance of our products. Although we have established some binding commitments from some of our strategic partners there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into additional definitive agreements or that the terms of such agreements will be satisfactory. It will be necessary for Wave to expand upon our current business relationships with our partners, or form new ones, in order to sell more products and services for Wave to become a viable, self-sufficient enterprise.\nProduct defects or development delays may limit our ability to sell our products.\nWe may experience delays in the development of our new products and services and the added features and functionality to our existing products and services that our customers and prospective customers are demanding. If we are unable to successfully develop products that contain the features and functionality being demanded by these customers and prospective customers in a timely manner, we may lose business to our competitors. In addition, despite testing by us and potential customers, it is possible that our products may nevertheless contain defects. Development delays or defects could have a material adverse effect on our business if such defects and delays result in our inability to meet the market's demand.\nIf we lose our key personnel, or fail to attract and retain additional personnel, we will be unable to continue to develop our products and technology.\nWe believe that our future success depends upon the continued service of our key technical personnel and on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, sales and marketing personnel. Our industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel. There can be no assurance that our current employees will continue to work for us or that we will be able to hire any additional personnel necessary for our growth. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Competition for these employees can be intense. We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future, and the failure of us to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights and others could infringe on or misappropriate our proprietary rights.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to enjoy or obtain protection for our products and technologies under United States and foreign patent laws, copyright laws and other intellectual property laws and to preserve our trade secrets. We cannot assure you that any patent owned or licensed by us will provide us with adequate protection or will not be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented.\nWe rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how which we protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and contract partners. However, our confidentiality agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for these breaches. Our trade secrets may become known or be independently discovered by competitors. We also rely on intellectual property laws to prevent the unauthorized duplication of our software and hardware products. However, intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our technology. We have registered various trademark and service mark registrations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Wave may apply for additional name and logo marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in the future but we cannot be assured that registration of any of these trademarks will be granted.\nWe conduct a portion of our operations in the State of Israel and, therefore, political, economic and military instability in Israel and its region may adversely affect our business.\nSafend's operations are located in the State of Israel which will constitute a material portion of our business. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has caused security and economic problems in Israel. Although Israel has entered into peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and various agreements with the Palestinian Authority, there has been a marked increase in violence, civil unrest and hostility, including armed clashes, between the State of Israel and the Palestinians and others, since September 2000. The establishment in 2006 of a government in the Gaza Strip by representatives of the Hamas militant group has created heightened unrest and uncertainty in the region. In mid-2006, Israel engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Shiite Islamist militia group based in Lebanon, and in June 2007, there was an escalation in violence in the Gaza Strip. From December 2008 through January 2009, Israel engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas, which involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel and which negatively affected business conditions in Israel. During July 2014, Israel was again engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas involving missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel which negatively affected business conditions in the region. Also, there continues to be great international concern in connection with Iran\u2019s efforts to develop and enrich uranium which could lead to the development of nuclear weapons. Iran\u2019s successful enrichment of uranium could significantly alter the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East, including the threat of international war, which could significantly impact business conditions in Israel.\nRecent political uprisings, regime changes and social unrest in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa are affecting the political stability of those countries. This instability may lead to deterioration of the political relationships that exist between Israel and these countries and have raised new concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict. Among other things, this instability may affect the global economy and marketplace through changes in oil and gas prices. Further escalation of tensions or violence might result in a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Israel and the portion of our business related to our operations there.\nSafend received Israeli government grants for certain of its research and development activities. The terms of these grants may require Safend to meet certain requirements in order to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel. Safend may be required to pay penalties in addition to repayment of the grants. Such grants may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our costs.\nThe research and development efforts of Safend have been financed, in part, through grants that Safend has received from the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist, or OCS. Safend therefore must comply with the requirements of the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development, 1984, and related regulations, or the Research Law regarding the intellectual property and products generated by Safend. The terms of these grants and the Research Law restrict the transfer of know-how if such know-how is related to products, know-how and/or technologies which were developed using the OCS grants, and the transfer of manufacturing or manufacturing rights of such products, technologies and/or know-how outside of Israel without the prior approval, pursuant to the Research Law, of the appropriate authority of the OCS. Therefore, the discretionary approval of an OCS committee will be required for any transfer to third parties outside of Israel of rights related to certain of Safend's technologies which have been developed with OCS funding. Safend may not receive the required approvals should it wish to transfer this technology and/or development outside of Israel in the future. Safend did not receive any grants during the year ended December 31, 2014 and does not intend on applying for new grants in the future.\nFurthermore, the OCS may impose certain conditions on any arrangement under which Safend transfers technology or development out of Israel. Overseas transfers of technology, manufacturing and/or development from OCS funded programs, even if approved by the OCS, may be subject to restrictions set forth in the Research Law. We cannot be certain that any approval of the OCS will be obtained on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If Safend fails to comply with the conditions imposed by the OCS, including the payment of royalties with respect to grants received, we may be required to refund any OCS payments previously received by Safend, together with interest and penalties, and may also be subject to criminal penalties.\nFailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and other similar anti-corruption laws, could subject us to penalties and damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain certain policies and procedures. Certain of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business are at a heightened risk for corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives. If we, or our intermediaries, fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, or similar laws of other countries, governmental authorities in the United States or elsewhere, as applicable, could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulation of international transactions may limit our ability to sell our products in foreign markets.\nMost of our software products are controlled under various United States export control laws and regulations and may require export licenses for certain exports of the products and components outside of the United States and Canada. With respect to our EMBASSY Trust Suite and EMBASSY Trust Server software applications, we have applied for and received export classifications that allow us to export our products without a license and with no restrictions to any country throughout the world with the exception of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.\nAny new product offerings will be subject to review by the Bureau of Export Administration to determine what export classification they will receive. Enhancements to existing products may be subject to review by the Bureau of Export Administration to determine their export classification. Some of our partners demand that our products be allowed to be exported without restrictions and/or reporting requirements. Current export regulations have, in part, allowed us to receive the desired classification without undue cost or effort. However, the export regulations may be modified at any time. Currently we are allowed to export the products for which we have received classification in an unrestricted manner without a license. However, modifications to the export regulations could prevent us from exporting our existing and future products in an unrestricted manner without a license. Such modifications could also make it difficult to receive the desired classification. If export regulations were to be modified in such a way, we may be put at a competitive disadvantage with respect to selling our products internationally.\nIn addition, import and export regulations of encryption/decryption technology vary from country to country. We may be subject to different statutory or regulatory controls in different foreign jurisdictions, and as such, our technology may not be permitted in these foreign jurisdictions. Violations of foreign regulations or regulation of international transactions could prevent us from being able to sell our products in international markets. Our success depends in large part to having access to international markets. A violation of foreign regulations could limit our access to such markets and have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe price of our Class A Common Stock has been, and likely will continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors such as:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products, acquisitions, capital commitments or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; and\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends in our markets.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market prices for technology-related companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock and any of our other securities for which a market develops regardless of our operating performance. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies that have experienced periods of volatility in the market price for their securities. It is possible that we could become the target of additional litigation of this kind that would require substantial management attention and expense. The diversion of management's attention and capital resources could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any negative publicity or perceived negative publicity of any such litigation could have an adverse impact on our business.\nGovernmental regulation may slow our growth and decrease our profitability.\nThere are currently few laws or regulations that apply directly to the Internet. Because our business is dependent, in significant respect, on the Internet, the adoption of new local, state, national or international laws or regulations may decrease the growth of Internet usage or the acceptance of Internet commerce which could decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce. New state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales, use and income taxes.\nIf we make any acquisitions we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits.\nIf appropriate opportunities become available we may attempt to acquire businesses, technologies, services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. If we do undertake any transaction of this sort the process of integrating an\nacquired business, technology, service or product may result in operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover, we may never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, it may harm our stock price and make it more difficult to sell shares.\nOur common stock is listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations Capital Market (\"NASDAQ\"). In order to maintain our NASDAQ listing, NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cBid Price Rule\u201d) requires that the bid price for our common stock not fall below $1.00 per share for a period of 30 consecutive trading days. On January 15, 2015, we received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that our common stock is subject to potential delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market because for a period of 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of our common stock closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion under the Bid Price Rule. The NASDAQ notice indicated that, in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we will be provided 180 calendar days, or until July 14, 2015, to regain compliance. If, at anytime before July 14, 2015, the bid price of the our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ staff will provide written notification that it has achieved compliance with the Bid Price Rule. If we fail to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule before July 14, 2015 but we meet all of the other applicable standards for initial listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market with the exception of the minimum bid price, then we may be eligible to have an additional 180 calendar days, or until January 10, 2016, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. In addition to the Bid Price Rule, in order to remain listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we must also maintain compliance with all of the other required continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, including the $35 million market capitalization requirement. If our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we expect that our common stock would be traded on the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\u2019s Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTC-BB). The level of trading activity of our common stock may decline if it is no longer listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. If our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market for any reason, it may harm our stock price, increase the volatility of our stock price and make it more difficult to sell your shares of our common stock.\nOur ability to raise capital may be limited by applicable laws and regulations.\nOur ability to raise capital using a shelf registration statement may be limited by, among other things, current Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) rules and regulations. Under current SEC rules and regulations, we must meet certain requirements to use a Form S\u22123 registration statement to raise capital without restriction as to the amount of the market value of securities sold thereunder. One such requirement is that the market value of our outstanding common stock held by non\u2212affiliates, or public float, be at least $75.0 million as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing the Form S\u22123. If we do not meet that requirement, then the aggregate market value of securities sold by us or on our behalf under the Form S\u22123 in any 12\u2212month period is limited to an aggregate of one\u2212third of our public float. Moreover, even if we meet the public float requirement at the time we file a Form S\u22123, SEC rules and regulations require that we periodically re\u2212evaluate the value of our public float, and if, at a re\u2212evaluation date, our public float is less than $75.0 million, we would become subject to the one\u2212third of public float limitation described above. If our ability to utilize a Form S\u22123 registration statement for a primary offering of our securities is limited to one\u2212third of our public float, we may conduct such an offering pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or under a Form S\u22121 registration statement and we would expect either of those alternatives to increase the cost of raising additional capital relative to utilizing a Form S\u22123 registration statement.\nIn addition, under current SEC rules and regulations, our common stock must be listed and registered on a national securities exchange in order to utilize a Form S\u22123 registration statement (i) for a primary offering, if our public float is not at least $75.0 million as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing the Form S\u22123, or a re\u2212evaluation date, whichever is later, and (ii) to register the resale of our securities by persons other than us (i.e., a resale offering). While currently our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing. The NASDAQ reviews the appropriateness of continued listing of any issuer that falls below the exchange\u2019s continued listing standards. Previously, including as recently as January 2015, we were not in compliance with certain NASDAQ continued listing standards and were at risk of having our common stock delisted from the NASDAQ. For additional information regarding this risk, see the risk factor above titled \u201cIf our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, it may harm our stock price and make it more difficult to sell shares.\u201d\nOur ability to timely raise sufficient additional capital also may be limited by the NASDAQ\u2019s stockholder approval requirements for transactions involving the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock. For instance, the NASDAQ requires that we obtain stockholder approval of any transaction involving the sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or\nmarket value, which (together with sales by our officers, directors and principal stockholders) equals 20% or more of our then outstanding common stock, unless the transaction is considered a \u201cpublic offering\u201d by the NASDAQ staff. Based on 51,475,368 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 2, 2014 and the closing price per share of our common stock on such date, which was $0.81, we could not raise more than approximately $8.3 million without obtaining stockholder approval, unless the transaction is deemed a public offering or does not involve the sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or market value. In addition, certain prior sales by us may be aggregated with any offering we may propose in the future, further limiting the amount we could raise in any future offering that is not considered a public offering by the NASDAQ staff and involves the sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or market value. The NASDAQ also requires that we obtain stockholder approval if the issuance or potential issuance of additional shares will be considered by the NASDAQ staff to result in a change of control of our company.\nObtaining stockholder approval is a costly and time-consuming process. If we are required to obtain stockholder approval for a potential transaction, we would expect to spend substantial additional money and resources. In addition, seeking stockholder approval would delay our receipt of otherwise available capital, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our current business strategy, and there is no guarantee our stockholders ultimately would approve a proposed transaction. A public offering under the NASDAQ rules typically involves broadly announcing the proposed ultimately would approve a proposed transaction. A public offering under the NASDAQ rules typically involves broadly announcing the proposed transaction, which often times has the effect of depressing the issuer\u2019s stock price. Accordingly, the price at which we could sell our securities in a public offering may be less, and the dilution existing stockholders experience may in turn be greater, than if we were able to raise capital through other means.", "PERMNO": 80858, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "WAVXQ"}
