{"cik": "1611983", "company": "Liberty Broadband Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFactors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure\nWe are a holding company, and we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\nOur ability to meet our current and future financial obligations, including to make debt service obligations under the Margin Loan Agreements (defined below), and other contractual commitments depends upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary Skyhook, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments, available funds under the 2016 Margin Loan Agreements (defined below) (which was $100 million as of December 31, 2016) and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. In addition, the ability of our only operating subsidiary to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on its operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which it may be or may become subject.\nWe do not have access to the cash that Charter generates from its operating activities.\nCharter generated approximately $8,041 million, $2,359 million and $2,359 million of cash from its operations during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Charter uses the cash it generates from its operations primarily to fund its business operations and to service its debt and other financial obligations. We do not have access to the cash that Charter generates unless Charter declares a dividend on its capital stock payable in cash, repurchases any or all of its outstanding shares of capital stock for cash (subject to any contractual restrictions on our ability to participate in any such repurchase) or otherwise distributes or makes payments to its stockholders, including us. Historically, Charter has not paid any dividends on its capital stock or, with limited exceptions, otherwise distributed cash to its stockholders and instead has used all of its available cash in the expansion of its business and to service its debt obligations. Covenants in Charter\u2019s existing debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. We expect that Charter will continue to apply its available cash to the expansion of its business.\nOur company may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nIn connection with the Broadband Spin-Off, we had outstanding borrowings of $400 million at December 31, 2016 under two margin loan agreements (the \u201c2014 Margin Loan Agreements\u201d) entered into by our wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Broadband (\u201cBroadbandSPV\u201d). We also had outstanding borrowings of $200 million at December 31, 2016 under two margin loan agreements (the \u201c2016 Margin Loan Agreements,\u201d and together with the 2014 Margin Loan Agreements, the \u201cMargin Loan Agreements\u201d) entered into by a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Liberty Broadband (\u201cCheetah 5\u201d). The obligations under the Margin Loan Agreements are guaranteed solely by our company and are secured by a portion of our ownership interest in Charter. Such equity interests are held through BroadbandSPV and Cheetah 5. The terms of the Margin Loan Agreements limit our company\u2019s ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms, and our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Our ability to secure additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon the operating performance of our subsidiary, Skyhook, the value of our investment in Charter, prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable terms or at all. If financing is not available when needed or is not available on favorable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business or market opportunities as they arise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nI-25\nWe have significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs discussed above, we entered into the 2014 Margin Loan Agreements as the guarantor, with BroadbandSPV as the borrower, pursuant to which BroadbandSPV had outstanding borrowings of $400 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, in connection with the Transactions, we entered into the 2016 Margin Loan Agreements as the guarantor, with Cheetah 5 as the borrower, pursuant to which Cheetah 5 had outstanding borrowings of $200 million, at December 31, 2016. As a result of this significant indebtedness, our company may:\n\u00b7\nExperience increased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nBe required to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nBe handicapped in its ability to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for its businesses; and\n\u00b7\nBe exposed to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any variable rate portion of its indebtedness.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. For additional limitations on our company\u2019s ability to potentially service our direct debt obligations, see \u201cWe are a holding company, and we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments\u201d and \u201cWe do not have access to the cash that Charter generates from its operating activities\u201d above.\nThe agreements that govern our current and future indebtedness may contain various affirmative and restrictive covenants that will limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nAs discussed above, we entered into the 2014 Margin Loan Agreements as the guarantor, with BroadbandSPV as the borrower, pursuant to which BroadbandSPV had outstanding borrowings of $400 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, in connection with the Transactions, we entered into the 2016 Margin Loan Agreements as the guarantor, with Cheetah 5 as the borrower, pursuant to which Cheetah 5 had outstanding borrowings of $200 million, with $100 million remaining available to be drawn until March 21, 2017, at December 31, 2016. The Margin Loan Agreements contain various covenants, including those that limit our ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness by having BroadbandSPV and Cheetah 5 enter into financing arrangements with respect to the portion of stock of Charter pledged to secure the loans under the Margin Loan Agreements, and cause BroadbandSPV and Cheetah 5 to enter into unrelated businesses or otherwise conduct business other than owning common stock of Charter and other assets as permitted under the Margin Loan Agreement documents. We may also enter into certain other indebtedness arrangements in the future. The instruments governing such indebtedness, often contain covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on our ability to incur more debt, exceed specified leverage ratios, pay dividends, make distributions, make investments, repurchase stock, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate, and transfer or sell assets. Any failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on Charter to provide us with the financial information that we use in accounting for our ownership interest in Charter as well as information regarding Charter that we include in our public filings.\nWe account for our approximately 20% ownership interest in Charter using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, in our financial statements we record our share of Charter\u2019s net income or loss. Within the meaning of U.S. accounting rules, we rely on Charter to provide us with financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which we use in the application of the equity method. We also rely on Charter to provide us with the information regarding their company that we include in our public filings. In addition, we cannot change the way in which Charter reports its financial results or require Charter to change its internal controls over financial reporting. No assurance can be given that Charter will provide us with the information necessary to enable us to complete our public filings on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, any material misstatements or omissions in the information Charter provides to us or publicly files could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and filing status under federal securities laws.\nI-26\nWe may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe do not believe we are currently subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, because our investment in Charter enables us to exercise significant influence over Charter. We have substantial involvement in the management and affairs of Charter, including through our board nominees. We nominated three of Charter\u2019s thirteen current directors. In connection with the Bright House Transaction, on May 23, 2015, we entered into the Stockholders Agreement, which continues to provide us with board nomination rights. If, however, our investment in Charter were deemed to become passive (such as in the event that our equity interest were significantly diluted and our nominees ceased to serve as directors of Charter), we could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to our corporate governance structure and financial reporting and could restrict our activities going forward. Our restated certificate of incorporation includes a provision that would enable us, at the option of our board of directors, to automatically convert each outstanding share of our Series B common stock into one share of our Series A common stock at such time as we have outstanding less than 20% of the total number of shares of our Series B common stock issued in the Broadband Spin-Off. In addition, if we were to become inadvertently subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, any violation of this act could subject us to material adverse consequences, including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that our contracts would be deemed unenforceable.\nOur company has overlapping directors and officers with Liberty, Liberty Interactive, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. and Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc., which may lead to conflicting interests.\nAs a result of the Broadband Spin-Off, the September 2011 separation of Starz from Liberty, the January 2013 spin-off of Liberty from Starz, and Liberty Interactive\u2019s 2014 spin-off of Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (\u201cTripCo\u201d) and 2016 split-off of Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. (\u201cExpediaCo\u201d), most of the executive officers of Broadband also serve as executive officers of Liberty, Liberty Interactive, TripCo and ExpediaCo and there are overlapping directors. With the exception of Liberty Interactive\u2019s ownership of shares of our non-voting Series C common stock, none of these companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and members of our company\u2019s board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Liberty, Liberty Interactive, TripCo, ExpediaCo or any other public company have fiduciary duties to that company\u2019s stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, Liberty, Liberty Interactive, TripCo or ExpediaCo pursues acquisitions and other business opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Our company has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and our restated certificate of incorporation will provide that no director or officer of our company will breach their fiduciary duty and therefore be liable to our company or its stockholders by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including Liberty, Liberty Interactive, TripCo and ExpediaCo) instead of our company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to our company, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company or as a director or officer of any of our subsidiaries, and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which our company or any of its subsidiaries is then directly engaged. In addition, any potential conflict that qualifies as a \u201crelated party transaction\u201d (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer\u2019s board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Liberty, Liberty Interactive, TripCo or ExpediaCo and/or their respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, Liberty, Liberty Interactive, TripCo or ExpediaCo or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nOur inter-company agreements were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Liberty.\nWe entered into a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by Liberty for certain of our businesses. In addition, we entered into a services agreement with Liberty pursuant to which it will provide to us certain management, administrative, financial, treasury, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we will reimburse them on a fixed fee basis. The terms of all of these agreements were established while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty, and hence may not be the result of arms\u2019 length negotiations. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances;\nI-27\nhowever, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements after the Broadband Spin-Off.\nFactors Relating to Charter\nThe following risks relate specifically to our equity affiliate Charter. If any of these risks were realized, they could have a material adverse effect on the value of our equity interests in Charter, which could negatively impact our stock price and our financial prospects.\nIf Charter is not able to successfully integrate its business with that of Legacy Time Warner Cable and Legacy Bright House within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In such circumstance, Charter may not perform as expected and the value of Charter\u2019s Class A common stock may be adversely affected.\nUntil the closing of the Transactions, Legacy Charter, Legacy Time Warner Cable and Legacy Bright House operated independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. Charter now has significantly more systems, assets, investments, businesses, customers and employees than each company did prior to the Transactions. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Charter employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of Charter\u2019s ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. The process of integrating Legacy Time Warner Cable and Legacy Bright House with the Legacy Charter operations will require significant capital expenditures and the expansion of certain operations and operating and financial systems. Management will be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the integration process and there is a significant degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process. These difficulties include:\n\u00b7\nintegrating the companies\u2019 operations and corporate functions;\n\u00b7\nintegrating the companies\u2019 technologies, networks and customer service platforms;\n\u00b7\nintegrating and unifying the product offerings and services available to customers, including customer premise equipment and video user interfaces;\n\u00b7\nharmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining the existing relationships and agreements with customers, providers, programmers and other vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, providers and vendors;\n\u00b7\naddressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u00b7\nconsolidating the companies\u2019 administrative and information technology infrastructure;\n\u00b7\ncoordinating programming and marketing efforts;\n\u00b7\ncoordinating geographically dispersed organizations;\n\u00b7\nintegrating information, purchasing, provisioning, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll, reporting and regulatory compliance systems;\n\u00b7\ncompleting the conversion of analog systems to all-digital for the Legacy Time Warner Cable and Legacy Bright House systems; and\n\u00b7\nattracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquired assets.\nEven if the new businesses are successfully integrated, it may not be possible to realize the benefits that are expected to result from the Transactions, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. For example, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, or the benefits from the Transactions may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses and increased operating costs. If the combined company fails to realize the anticipated benefits from the transactions, its liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and/or share price may be\nI-28\nadversely affected. In addition, at times, the attention of certain members of Charter\u2019s management and resources may be focused on the integration of the businesses and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt the business of the combined company. \u2028\nIf the operating results of Legacy Time Warner Cable and/or Legacy Bright House are less than Charter\u2019s expectations, or an increase in the capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain those assets as well as to keep pace with technological developments is greater than expected, Charter may not achieve the expected level of financial results from the Transactions.\nCharter will derive a portion of its continuing revenues and earnings per share from the operation of Legacy Time Warner Cable and Legacy Bright House. Therefore, any negative impact on these companies or the operating results derived from such companies could harm the combined company\u2019s operating results.\nThe businesses of Charter, Legacy Time Warner Cable and Legacy Bright House are characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services. Charter intends to make investments in the combined business and transition toward only using two-way all-digital set-top boxes. The increase in capital expenditures necessary for the transition toward two-way set-top boxes in the business may negatively impact the expected financial results from the Transactions. The combined company may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, execute the plans to do so, or anticipate the demand of its customers for products and services requiring new technology or bandwidth. Charter\u2019s inability to maintain, expand and upgrade its existing or combined businesses could materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Transactions were accounted for as an acquisition by Charter in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Legacy Time Warner Cable and Legacy Bright House have been recorded, as of the date of completion of the Transactions, at their respective fair values and added to Charter\u2019s assets and liabilities.\nThe excess of the purchase price over those fair values has been recorded as goodwill. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired, Charter may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. Such a potential impairment charge could have a material impact on Charter\u2019s operating results.\nAs a result of the closing of the Transactions, Charter\u2019s businesses are subject to the conditions set forth in the FCC Order and the DOJ Consent Decree and those imposed by state utility commissions and local franchise authorities, and there can be no assurance that these conditions will not have an adverse effect on Charter\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nIn connection with the Transactions, the FCC Order, the DOJ Consent Decree, and the approvals from state utility commissions and local franchise authorities incorporated numerous commitments and voluntary conditions made by the parties and imposed numerous conditions on Charter\u2019s businesses relating to the operation of its business and other matters. Among other things, (i) Charter is not permitted to charge usage-based prices or impose data caps and is prohibited from charging interconnection fees for qualifying parties; (ii) Charter is prohibited from entering into or enforcing any agreement with a programmer that forbids, limits or creates incentives to limit the programmer\u2019s provision of content to OVDs and cannot retaliate against programmers for licensing to OVDs; (iii) Charter cannot avail itself of other distributors\u2019 most favored nation provisions if they are inconsistent with this prohibition; (iv) Charter must undertake a number of actions designed to promote diversity; (v) Charter must appoint an independent compliance monitor and comply with a broad array of reporting requirements; and (vi) Charter must satisfy various other conditions relating to its high-speed Internet services, including building out an additional two million locations with access to a high-speed connection of at least 60 megabits per second with at least one million of those connections in competition with another high-speed broadband provider in the market served, and implementing a reduced price high-speed internet program for low income families. These and other conditions and commitments relating to the Transactions are of varying duration, ranging from three to seven years. In light of the breadth and duration of the conditions and potential changes in market conditions during the time the conditions and commitments are in effect, there can be no assurance that Charter\u2019s compliance, and ability to comply, with the conditions will not have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations.\nI-29\nCharter has a significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect its financial health and ability to react to changes in its business.\nCharter has a significant amount of debt and may (subject to applicable restrictions in each of its debt instruments) incur additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2016, Charter\u2019s total principal amount of debt was approximately $60.0 billion.\nAs a result of this significant indebtedness, Charter may:\n\u00b7\nbe impacted in its ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates, or at all;\n\u00b7\nbe vulnerable to interest rate increases because approximately 13% of its borrowings as of December 31, 2016 were, and may continue to be, subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u00b7\nbe exposed to increased interest expense to the extent it refinances existing debt with higher cost debt;\n\u00b7\nbe required to dedicate a significant portion of its cash flow from operating activities to make payments on its debt, reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate expenses;\n\u00b7\nexperience limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in Charter\u2019s business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large;\n\u00b7\nbe placed at a disadvantage compared to its competitors that have proportionately less debt; and\n\u00b7\nbe adversely affected by Charter\u2019s relationship with customers and suppliers.\nIf current debt amounts increase, Charter\u2019s business results are lower than expected, or credit rating agencies downgrade Charter\u2019s debt limiting its access to investment grade markets, the related risks that Charter faces will intensify.\nThe agreements and instruments governing Charter\u2019s debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect Charter\u2019s ability to operate its business, as well as significantly affect its liquidity.\nCharter\u2019s credit facilities and the indentures governing its debt contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to operate its business, liquidity and results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, Charter and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt;\n\u00b7\nrepurchase or redeem equity interests and debt;\n\u00b7\nissue equity;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u00b7\ndispose of assets or merge;\n\u00b7\nenter into related party transactions; and\n\u00b7\ngrant liens and pledge assets.\nAdditionally, the Charter Communications Operating, LLC (\u201cCharter Operating\u201d) credit facilities require Charter Operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant. The breach of any covenants or obligations in Charter\u2019s indentures or credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing Charter\u2019s long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under Charter\u2019s notes and the Charter Operating credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in Charter\u2019s subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors.\nI-30\nCharter depends on generating sufficient cash flow to fund its debt obligations, capital expenditures, and ongoing operations.\nCharter is dependent on its cash on hand and cash flow from operations to fund its debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nCharter\u2019s ability to service its debt and to fund its planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on its ability to continue to generate cash flow and its access (by dividend or otherwise) to additional liquidity sources at the applicable obligor. Charter\u2019s ability to continue to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nits ability to sustain and grow revenue and cash flow from operations by offering video, Internet, voice, advertising and other services to residential and commercial customers, to adequately meet the customer experience demands in its markets and to maintain and grow its customer base, particularly in the face of increasingly aggressive competition, the need for innovation and the related capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of competition from other market participants, including but not limited to incumbent telephone companies, direct broadcast satellite operators, wireless broadband and telephone providers, digital subscriber line \u201cDSL\u201d providers, video provided over the Internet and providers of advertising over the Internet;\n\u00b7\ngeneral business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn, high unemployment levels and the level of activity in the housing sector;\n\u00b7\nCharter\u2019s ability to obtain programming at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher programming costs (including retransmission consents);\n\u00b7\nthe development and deployment of new products and technologies, including Charter\u2019s cloud-based user interface, Spectrum Guide\u00ae;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of governmental regulation on its business or potential business combination transactions; and\n\u00b7\nany events that disrupt Charter\u2019s networks, information systems or properties and impair its operating activities and negatively impact its reputation.\nSome of these factors are beyond Charter\u2019s control. If it is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or it is unable to access additional liquidity sources, Charter may not be able to service and repay its debt, operate its business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund its other liquidity and capital needs.\nRestrictions in Charter\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 debt instruments and under applicable law limit their ability to provide funds to Charter and its subsidiaries that are debt issuers.\nCharter\u2019s primary assets are its equity interests in its subsidiaries. Charter\u2019s operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and are not obligated to make funds available to their debt issuer holding companies for payments on Charter\u2019s notes or other obligations in the form of loans, distributions, or otherwise. Charter Operating\u2019s ability to make distributions to Charter, CCO Holdings, LLC (\u201cCCO Holdings\u201d), its other primary debt issuers other than Time Warner Cable, LLC (\u201cTWC, LLC\u201d) and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC (\u201cTWCE\u201d), to service debt obligations is subject to its compliance with the terms of its credit facilities, and restrictions under applicable law. TWC, LLC\u2019s and TWCE\u2019s ability to make distributions to Charter, CCO Holdings or Charter Operating to service debt obligations is subject to restrictions under applicable law. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the \u201cDLLCA\u201d), Charter\u2019s subsidiaries may only make distributions if the relevant entity has \u201csurplus\u201d as defined in the DLLCA. Under fraudulent transfer laws, Charter\u2019s subsidiaries may not pay dividends if the relevant entity is insolvent or is rendered insolvent thereby. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if:\n\u00b7\nthe sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;\n\u00b7\nthe present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n\u00b7\nit could not pay its debts as they became due.\nI-31\nWhile Charter believes that its relevant subsidiaries currently have surplus and are not insolvent, these subsidiaries may become insolvent in the future. Charter\u2019s direct or indirect subsidiaries include the borrowers and guarantors under the Charter Operating credit facilities and notes, under the CCO Holdings notes and under the TWC, LLC and TWCE notes. As of December 31, 2016, Charter\u2019s total principal amount of debt was approximately $60.0 billion.\nIn the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution of one or more of its subsidiaries, that subsidiary\u2019s assets would first be applied to satisfy its own obligations, and following such payments, such subsidiary may not have sufficient assets remaining to make payments to its parent company as an equity holder or otherwise. In that event, the lenders under Charter Operating's credit facilities and notes and any other indebtedness of Charter\u2019s subsidiaries whose interests are secured by substantially all of Charter\u2019s operating assets, and all holders of other debt of Charter Operating, CCO Holdings, TWC, LLC and TWCE will have the right to be paid in full before Charter from any of its subsidiaries' assets.\nSome of Charter\u2019s outstanding debt is subject to change of control provisions. It may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill its obligations under its indebtedness following a change of control, which would place Charter in default under the applicable debt instruments.\nCharter may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill its obligations under its notes and its credit facilities following a change of control. Under the indentures governing the CCO Holdings\u2019 notes, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, the debt issuer is required to offer to repurchase all of its outstanding notes. However, Charter may not have sufficient access to funds at the time of the change of control event to make the required repurchase of the applicable notes and Charter Operating is limited in its ability to make distributions or other payments to any debt issuer to fund any required repurchase. In addition, a change of control under the Charter Operating credit facilities would result in a default under those credit facilities, which would trigger a default under the indentures governing the CCO Holdings\u2019 notes, the Charter Operating notes and the TWC, LLC and TWCE notes. Because such credit facilities and notes are obligations of Charter Operating and its subsidiaries, the credit facilities would have to be repaid before Charter Operating\u2019s assets could be available to CCO Holdings to repurchase their notes. Any failure to make or complete a change of control offer would place CCO Holdings in default under its notes. The failure of Charter\u2019s subsidiaries to make a change of control offer or repay the amounts accelerated under their notes and credit facilities would place them in default under such agreements.\nCharter operates in a very competitive business environment, which affects its ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect its business, operations and financial results.\nThe industry in which Charter operates is highly competitive and has become more so in recent years. In some instances, Charter competes against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, better access to financing, greater personnel resources, greater resources for marketing, greater and more favorable brand name recognition, and long-established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. Increasing consolidation in the cable industry and the repeal of certain ownership rules have provided additional benefits to certain of Charter\u2019s competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale.\nCharter\u2019s residential video service faces competition from a number of sources, including direct broadcast satellite services, as well as other companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections to TVs, computers, tablets and mobile devices. Charter\u2019s residential Internet service faces competition from the phone companies\u2019 DSL, FTTH and wireless broadband offerings as well as from a variety of companies that offer other forms of online services, including wireless and satellite-based broadband services. Charter\u2019s residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone providers, as well as other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. Competition from these companies, including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing, exclusive programming and increased HD broadcasting may have an adverse impact on Charter\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers.\nOverbuilds could also adversely affect Charter\u2019s growth, financial condition, and results of operations, by creating or increasing competition. Charter is aware of traditional overbuild situations impacting certain of its markets, however, Charter is unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situations may occur.\nI-32\nCharter\u2019s services may not allow it to compete effectively. Competition may reduce its expected growth of future cash flows which may contribute to future impairments of Charter\u2019s franchises and goodwill and Charter\u2019s ability to meet cash flow requirements, including debt service requirements.\nCharter faces risks relating to competition for the leisure time and discretionary spending of audiences, which has intensified in part due to advances in technology and changes in consumer expectations and behavior.\nIn addition to the various competitive factors discussed above, Charter is subject to risks relating to increasing competition for the leisure time, shifting consumer needs and discretionary spending of consumers. Charter competes with all other sources of entertainment, news and information delivery, as well as a broad range of communications products and services. Technological advancements, such as new video formats and Internet streaming and downloading of programming that can be viewed on televisions, computers, smartphones and tablets, many of which have been beneficial to Charter, have nonetheless increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation.\nNewer products and services, particularly alternative methods for the distribution, sale and viewing of content will likely continue to be developed, further increasing the number of competitors that Charter faces. The increasing number of choices available to audiences, including low-cost or free choices, could negatively impact not only consumer demand for Charter\u2019s products and services, but also advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase advertising from Charter. Charter competes for the sale of advertising revenue with television networks and stations, as well as other advertising platforms, such as radio, print and, increasingly, online media. Charter\u2019s failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technologies and changes in consumer expectations and behavior could significantly adversely affect its competitive position and its business and results of operations.\nCharter\u2019s exposure to the economic conditions of its current and potential customers, vendors and third parties could adversely affect its cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nCharter is exposed to risks associated with the economic conditions of its current and potential customers, the potential financial instability of its customers and their financial ability to purchase its products. If there were a general economic downturn, Charter may experience increased cancellations by its customers or unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased, including an increase in the number of homes that replace their video service with Internet-delivered and/or over-air content, which would negatively impact Charter\u2019s ability to attract customers, increase rates and maintain or increase revenue. In addition, providing video services is an established and highly penetrated business. Charter\u2019s ability to gain new video subscribers is dependent to a large extent on growth in occupied housing in its service areas, which is influenced by both national and local economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also have a negative impact on Charter\u2019s advertising revenue. These events have adversely affected Charter in the past, and may adversely affect its cash flow, results of operations and financial condition if a downturn were to occur.\nIn addition, Charter is susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which Charter relies to provide products and services or to which it outsources certain functions. The same economic conditions that may affect Charter\u2019s customers, as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in output or the bankruptcy of Charter\u2019s vendors or third parties upon which Charter relies. Any interruption in the services provided by Charter\u2019s vendors or by third parties could adversely affect Charter\u2019s cash flow, results of operation and financial condition.\nCharter faces risks inherent in its commercial business.\nCharter may encounter unforeseen difficulties as it increases the scale of its service offerings to businesses. Charter sells Internet access, data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video and business voice services to businesses and has increased its focus on growing this business. In order to grow its commercial business, Charter expects to continue to invest in technology, equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business. Commercial business customers often require service level agreements and generally have heightened customer expectations for reliability of services. If Charter\u2019s efforts to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful, the growth of its commercial services business would be limited. Charter depends on interconnection and related services provided by certain third parties for the growth of its commercial business. As a result, its ability to implement changes as the services grow may be limited. If Charter\nI-33\nis unable to meet these service level requirements or expectations, its commercial business could be adversely affected. Finally, Charter expects advances in communications technology, as well as changes in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment. Consequently, Charter is unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future developments in these areas might have on its voice and commercial businesses and operations.\nProgramming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation, and Charter may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rates of, or pass on to its customers, its increasing programming costs, which would adversely affect its cash flow and operating margins.\nVideo programming has been, and is expected to continue to be, Charter\u2019s largest operating expense item. In recent years, the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in the cost of programming. Charter expects programming costs to continue to increase because of a variety of factors including amounts paid for broadcast station retransmission consent, annual increases imposed by programmers and carriage of incremental programming, including new services and VOD programming. The inability to fully pass programming cost increases on to its customers has had, and is expected in the future to have, an adverse impact on Charter\u2019s cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product. Charter has programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of 2017. There can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. Three programmers have filed lawsuits against Charter regarding which legacy programming arrangements apply after the closing of the Transactions, and there can be no assurance that other programmers will not bring similar suits in the future. In addition, a number of programmers have begun to sell their services through alternative distribution channels which may cause those programmers to seek even higher programming fees from Charter as this may degrade security of their product, increase their operating costs or reduce their advertising revenue. To the extent that Charter is unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that it believes are reasonable, Charter has been, and may be in the future, forced to remove such programming channels from its line-up, which may result in a loss of customers. Charter\u2019s failure to carry programming that is attractive to its subscribers could adversely impact Charter\u2019s customer levels, operations and financial results. In addition, if Charter\u2019s Internet customers are unable to access desirable content online because content providers block or limit access by its subscribers as a class, its ability to gain and retain customers, especially Internet customers, may be negatively impacted.\nIncreased demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services or payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent are likely to further increase Charter\u2019s programming costs. Federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between \u201cmust-carry\u201d rights and an alternative \u201cretransmission-consent\u201d regime. When a station opts for the retransmission-consent regime, Charter is not allowed to carry the station\u2019s signal without the station\u2019s permission. In some cases, Charter carries stations under short-term arrangements while it attempts to negotiate new long-term retransmission agreements. If negotiations with these programmers prove unsuccessful, they could require Charter to cease carrying their signals, possibly for an indefinite period. Any loss of stations could make its video service less attractive to customers, which could result in less subscription and advertising revenue. In retransmission-consent negotiations, broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which they or their affiliates have an interest. Carriage of these other services, as well as increased fees for retransmission rights, may increase Charter\u2019s programming expenses and diminish the amount of capacity it has available to introduce new services, which could have an adverse effect on its business and financial results.\nI-34\nCharter\u2019s inability to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new products and services could limit its ability to compete effectively.\nCharter operates in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. Its success is, to a large extent, dependent on its ability to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to address consumers\u2019 changing demands and distinguish its services from those of its competitors. Charter may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new products and services. If Charter chooses technologies or equipment that are less effective, cost-efficient or attractive to customers than those chosen by its competitors, if Charter offer services that fail to appeal to consumers, are not available at competitive prices or that do not function as expected, or Charter is not able to fund the expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, its competitive position could deteriorate, and its business and financial results could suffer.\nThe ability of some of Charter\u2019s competitors to introduce new technologies, products and services more quickly than Charter does may adversely affect its competitive position. Furthermore, advances in technology, decreases in the cost of existing technologies or changes in competitors\u2019 product and service offerings may require Charter in the future to make additional research and development expenditures or to offer at no additional charge or at a lower price certain products and services that Charter currently offers to customers separately or at a premium. In addition, the uncertainty of Charter\u2019s ability, and the costs, to obtain intellectual property rights from third parties could impact its ability to respond to technological advances in a timely and effective manner.\nThe implementation of Charter\u2019s network-based user interface, Spectrum Guide, may ultimately be unsuccessful or more expensive than anticipated. Charter\u2019s inability to maintain and expand its upgraded systems and provide advanced services such as a state of the art user interface in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequently, its growth, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.\nCharter depends on third party service providers, suppliers and licensors; thus, if it is unable to procure the necessary services, equipment, software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a timely basis, its ability to offer services could be impaired, and Charter\u2019s growth, operations, business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nCharter depends on a limited number of third party service providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of its services. Some of Charter\u2019s hardware, software and operational support vendors, and service providers represent its sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. If any of these parties breaches or terminates its agreement with Charter or otherwise fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, demand exceeds these vendors\u2019 capacity, they experience operating or financial difficulties, they significantly increase the amount Charter pay for necessary products or services, or they cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand, profitability or a change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services Charter needs in a timely manner, at its specifications and at reasonable prices, its ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay Charter\u2019s ability to serve its customers. In addition, the existence of only a limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product innovation and higher costs. These events could materially and adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to retain and attract customers and its operations, business, financial results and financial condition.\nCharter\u2019s cable systems have historically been restricted to using one of two proprietary conditional access security systems, which Charter believes has limited the number of manufacturers producing set-top boxes for such systems. As an alternative, Charter has developed a new conditional access security system which can be downloaded into set-top boxes with features Charter specifies that could be provided by a variety of manufacturers. Charter refers to its specified set-top box as the Worldbox. Additionally, Charter is developing technology to allow its two current proprietary conditional access security systems to be software downloadable into its Worldbox. In order to realize the broadest benefits of Charter\u2019s Worldbox technology, Charter must now complete the support for the downloadable proprietary conditional access security systems within the Worldbox. Charter cannot provide assurances that this implementation will ultimately be successful or completed in the expected timeframe or at the expected budget.\nI-35\nCharter\u2019s business may be adversely affected if Charter cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which its business depends.\nCharter relies on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with its employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain Charter\u2019s intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in its operations. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change, Charter both develops its own technologies, products and services and relies on technologies developed or licensed by third parties. However, any of Charter\u2019s intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit Charter to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm. Charter may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, claims of intellectual property infringement could require Charter to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require Charter to change its business practices or offerings and limit its ability to compete effectively. Even unsuccessful claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from Charter\u2019s business. In recent years, the number of intellectual property infringement claims has been increasing in the communications and entertainment industries, and, with increasing frequency, Charter is party to litigation alleging that certain of its services or technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nVarious events could disrupt Charter\u2019s networks, information systems or properties and could impair its operating activities and negatively impact Charter\u2019s reputation and financial results.\nNetwork and information systems technologies are critical to Charter\u2019s operating activities, both for its internal uses, such as network management and supplying services to Charter\u2019s customers, including customer service operations and programming delivery. Network or information system shutdowns or other service disruptions caused by events such as computer hacking, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, \u201ccyber attacks,\u201d process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity pose increasing risks. Both unsuccessful and successful \u201ccyber attacks\u201d on companies have continued to increase in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While Charter develops and maintains systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as techniques used in such attacks become more sophisticated and change frequently. Charter, and the third parties on which Charter relies, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. While from time to time attempts have been made to access Charter\u2019s network, these attempts have not as yet resulted in any material release of information, degradation or disruption to its network and information systems.\nCharter\u2019s network and information systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, accidents, natural disasters (including extreme weather arising from short-term or any long-term changes in weather patterns), terrorist attacks and similar events. Further, the impacts associated with extreme weather or long-term changes in weather patterns, such as rising sea levels or increased and intensified storm activity, may cause increased business interruptions or may require the relocation of some of Charter\u2019s facilities. Charter\u2019s system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and Charter\u2019s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.\nAny of these events, if directed at, or experienced by, Charter or technologies upon which Charter depends, could have adverse consequences on Charter\u2019s network, customers and business, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers, and damage to Charter\u2019s or its customers' equipment and data. Large expenditures may be necessary to repair or replace damaged property, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance that Charter maintains against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover Charter\u2019s losses or otherwise adequately compensate Charter for any disruptions to its business that may result. Any such significant service disruption could result in damage to Charter\u2019s reputation and credibility, customer dissatisfaction and ultimately a loss of customers or revenue. Any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect Charter\u2019s growth, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, Charter\u2019s operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in its information technology systems and networks and those of its third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. Charter provides certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with its business, and there is a risk that this information may be compromised.\nI-36\nAs a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related risks are increasing, particularly for businesses like Charter\u2019s that process, store and transmit large amount of data, including personal information for Charter\u2019s customers. Charter could be exposed to significant costs if such risks were to materialize, and such events could damage Charter\u2019s reputation, credibility and business and have a negative impact on its revenue. Charter could be subject to regulatory actions and claims made by consumers in private litigations involving privacy issues related to consumer data collection and use practices. Charter also could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.\nThe risk described above may be increased during the period in which Charter integrates its people, processes and systems as a result of the Transactions.\nFor tax purposes, Charter could experience a deemed ownership change in the future that could limit its ability to use its tax loss carryforwards.\nCharter had approximately $11.2 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2016. These losses resulted from the operations of Charter Communications Holdings Company, LLC (\u201cCharter Holdco\u201d) and its subsidiaries, and from loss carryforwards received as a result of the TWC Transaction. Federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2018 through 2035. In addition, Charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $304 million as of December 31, 2016. State tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2017 through 2035.\nIn the past, Charter has experienced \u201cownership changes\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d at any time over the preceding three years. As a result, Charter is subject to an annual limitation on the use of its loss carryforwards which existed at November 30, 2009 for the first \u201cownership change,\u201d those that existed at May 1, 2013 for the second \u201cownership change,\u201d and those created at May 18, 2016 for the third \"ownership change.\" The limitation on Charter\u2019s ability to use its loss carryforwards, in conjunction with the loss carryforward expiration provisions, could reduce its ability to use a portion of its loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income, which could result in Charter being required to make material cash tax payments. Charter\u2019s ability to make such income tax payments, if any, will depend at such time on its liquidity or its ability to raise additional capital, and/or on receipt of payments or distributions from Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries.\nIf Charter were to experience additional ownership changes in the future (as a result of purchases and sales of stock by its \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d new issuances or redemptions of its stock, certain acquisitions of its stock and issuances, redemptions, sales or other dispositions or acquisitions of interests in Charter\u2019s \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d), its ability to use its loss carryforwards could become subject to further limitations.\nIf Legacy Time Warner Cable\u2019s Separation Transactions (as defined below), including the Distribution (as defined below), do not qualify as tax-free, either as a result of actions taken or not taken by Time Warner Cable or as a result of the failure of certain representations by Legacy Time Warner Cable to be true, Legacy Time Warner Cable has agreed to indemnify Time Warner Inc. for its taxes resulting from such disqualification, which would be significant.\nAs part of Legacy Time Warner Cable\u2019s separation from Time Warner Inc. (\u201cTime Warner\u201d) in March 2009 (the \u201cSeparation\u201d), Time Warner received a private letter ruling from the IRS and Time Warner and Time Warner Cable received opinions of tax counsel confirming that the transactions undertaken in connection with the Separation, including the transfer by a subsidiary of Time Warner of its 12.43% non-voting common stock interest in TW NY to Time Warner Cable in exchange for 80 million newly issued shares of Legacy Time Warner Cable\u2019s Class A common stock, Legacy Time Warner Cable\u2019s payment of a special cash dividend to holders of Legacy Time Warner Cable\u2019s outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, the conversion of each share of Legacy Time Warner Cable\u2019s outstanding Class A and Class B common stock into one share of Legacy Time Warner Cable common stock, and the pro-rata dividend of all shares of Legacy Time Warner Cable common stock held by Time Warner to holders of record of Time Warner\u2019s common stock (the \u201cDistribution\u201d and, together with all of the transactions, the \u201cSeparation Transactions\u201d), should generally qualify as tax-free to Time Warner and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The ruling and opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from\nI-37\nTime Warner and Legacy Time Warner Cable regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Time Warner and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the Separation Transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in the stock ownership of Time Warner or Legacy Time Warner Cable after the Distribution.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement among Time Warner and Legacy Time Warner Cable, Legacy Time Warner Cable generally would be required to indemnify Time Warner against its taxes resulting from the failure of any of the Separation Transactions to qualify as tax-free as a result of (i) certain actions or failures to act by Legacy Time Warner Cable or (ii) the failure of certain representations made by Legacy Time Warner Cable to be true. In addition, even if Legacy Time Warner Cable bears no contractual responsibility for taxes related to a failure of the Separation Transactions to qualify for their intended tax treatment, Treasury regulation section 1.1502-6 imposes on Legacy Time Warner Cable several liability for all Time Warner federal income tax obligations relating to the period during which Legacy Time Warner Cable was a member of the Time Warner federal consolidated tax group, including the date of the Separation Transactions. Similar provisions may apply under foreign, state or local law. Absent Legacy Time Warner Cable causing the Separation Transactions to not qualify as tax-free, Time Warner has indemnified Legacy Time Warner Cable against such several liability arising from a failure of the Separation Transactions to qualify for their intended tax treatment.\nIf Charter is unable to retain key employees, its ability to manage its business could be adversely affected.\nCharter\u2019s operational results have depended, and its future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of its management team. Charter\u2019s ability to retain and hire new key employees for management positions could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications industry. The loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to manage its business and its future operational and financial results.\nCharter\u2019s inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm its operating results.\nCharter continuously evaluates and pursues small and large acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses, products or technologies that it believes could complement or expand its business or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. From time to time, Charter may enter into letters of intent with companies with which it is negotiating for potential acquisitions or investments, or as to which it is conducting due diligence. An investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products or technologies in the future could materially decrease the amount of Charter\u2019s available cash or require it to seek additional equity or debt financing. Charter may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential acquisition, conducting thorough due diligence, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into its existing business and operations. Charter\u2019s due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or customer issues.\nAdditionally, in connection with any acquisitions Charter completes, including the recently completed Transactions, Charter may not achieve the growth, synergies or other financial and operating benefits Charter expected to achieve, and Charter may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect its operating results or financial position or could otherwise harm its business. Even if Charter is able to integrate the business operations obtained in such transactions successfully, it is not possible to predict with certainty if or when these cost synergies, growth opportunities and benefits will occur, or the extent to which they actually will be achieved. For example, the benefits from such transactions may be offset by costs incurred in integrating new business operations or in obtaining or attempting to obtain regulatory approvals, or increased operating costs that may be experienced as a result of the transactions. Realization of any benefits and cost synergies could be affected by the factors described in other risk factors and a number of factors beyond Charter\u2019s control, as applicable, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs, the response of competitors and vendors and regulatory developments. Further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product\nI-38\nor technology, individually or across multiple opportunities, could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters.\nCharter\u2019s business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which could adversely affect its business.\nRegulation of the cable industry has increased cable operators\u2019 operational and administrative expenses and limited their revenue. Cable operators are subject to various laws and regulations including those covering the following:\n\u00b7\nthe provisioning and marketing of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technologies;\n\u00b7\ncustomer and employee privacy and data security;\n\u00b7\nlimited rate regulation of video service;\n\u00b7\ncopyright royalties for retransmitting broadcast signals;\n\u00b7\nwhen a cable system must carry a particular broadcast station and when it must first obtain retransmission consent to carry a broadcast station;\n\u00b7\nthe provision of channel capacity to unaffiliated commercial leased access programmers;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability to enter into exclusive agreements with multiple dwelling unit complexes and control Charter\u2019s inside wiring;\n\u00b7\nthe provision of high-speed Internet service, including net neutrality or open Internet rules;\n\u00b7\nthe provision of voice communications;\n\u00b7\ncable franchise renewals and transfers;\n\u00b7\nequal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, marketing practices, customer service, and consumer protection; and\n\u00b7\napproval for mergers and acquisitions often accompanied by the imposition of restrictions and requirements on an applicant's business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction.\nLegislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase Charter\u2019s costs or impose additional restrictions on Charter\u2019s businesses. For example, with respect to Charter\u2019s retail broadband Internet access service, the FCC has (1) reclassified the service as a Title II service, (2) applied certain existing Title II provisions and associated regulations to it, (3) forborne from applying a range of other existing Title II provisions and associated regulations, but to varying degrees indicated that this forbearance may be only temporary, and (4) issued new rules expanding disclosure requirements and prohibiting blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and unreasonable interference with the ability of end users and edge providers to reach each other. The order also subjected broadband providers\u2019 Internet traffic exchange rates and practices to potential FCC oversight for the first time and created a mechanism for third parties to file complaints regarding these matters. These FCC actions were upheld on appeal in June 2016, although additional appeals remain pending. Congress or the FCC may modify or repeal these regulations.\nAs a result of the reclassification of broadband Internet access service as a Title II communications service, the FCC adopted new privacy and data security rules for common carriers, interconnected VoIP providers, and broadband service providers on October 27, 2016. The new rules replace the prior rules and extend broader privacy protections to broadband customers, as well as voice service customers. The new rules place heightened restrictions on the use of customer information that Internet service providers obtain from the provision of broadband Internet access service (including increased notice, consumer choice, and security), and are more restrictive than other existing privacy and security frameworks. The new rules are subject to additional regulatory approval and legal challenges.\nI-39\nChanges to existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or adoption of new ones, could have an adverse effect on Charter\u2019s business.\nThere are ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state, and local regulation of some of the services offered over Charter\u2019s cable systems, which may compound the regulatory risks Charter already faces. For example, the FCC recently proposed new regulations that would affect Charter\u2019s point to point transport service as well as other commercial data services (\u201cbusiness data services\u201d). As a result, the FCC may price regulate business data services as common carriage services and adopt additional restrictions on contracting terms. The FCC also has considered adopting new navigation device rules, pursuant to Section 629 of the Communications Act, which directs the FCC to assure the availability of navigation devices (such as set-top boxes) from third party providers. In 2016, the FCC proposed new rules that would have required Charter to make disaggregated \u201cinformation flows\u201d available to set-top boxes and apps supplied by third parties. That proposal has not been adopted, but various parties may continue to advocate alternative regulatory approaches to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator provided set-top boxes. The FCC also is considering the appropriate regulatory framework for VoIP service, including whether that service should be regulated under Title II.\nCongress may consider legislation that could increase costs on the company, including (1) the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for Charter\u2019s business, (2) a change in corporate tax laws that could eliminate some of our current deductions, and (3) broadband subsidies to rural areas that could result in subsidized overbuilding of Charter\u2019s more rural facilities.\nIf any of these pending laws and regulations are enacted, they could affect Charter\u2019s operations and require significant expenditures. We cannot predict future developments in these areas, and we are already subject to Charter-specific conditions regarding certain Internet practices as a result of the FCC\u2019s approval of the Transactions, but any changes to the regulatory framework for Charter\u2019s Internet or VoIP services could have a negative impact on Charter\u2019s business and results of operations.\nIt remains uncertain what rule changes, if any, will ultimately be adopted by Congress and the FCC and what operating or financial impact any such rules might have on Charter, including on its programming agreements, customer privacy and the user experience. In addition, the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau has been actively investigating certain industry practices of various companies and imposing forfeitures for alleged regulatory violations.\nCharter\u2019s cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. The failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect its business.\nCharter\u2019s cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits, and similar authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling the public rights-of-way. Many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. In some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and Charter has operated and is operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.\nThere can be no assurance that Charter will be able to comply with all significant provisions of its franchise agreements and certain of its franchisers have from time to time alleged that Charter has not complied with these agreements. Additionally, although historically Charter has renewed its franchises without incurring significant costs, there can be no assurance that Charter will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, its franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect Charter\u2019s business in the affected geographic area.\nI-40\nCharter\u2019s cable system franchises are non-exclusive. Accordingly, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises and create additional competition for Charter\u2019s products, resulting in overbuilds, which could adversely affect results of operations.\nCharter\u2019s cable system franchises are non-exclusive. Consequently, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises to competitors in the same geographic area or operate their own cable systems. In some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with Charter on more favorable terms. Potential competitors (like Google) have recently pursued and obtained local franchises that are more favorable than the incumbent operator\u2019s franchise.\nThe FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce franchising burdens for these new entrants. At the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws, principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing operators. Broadband delivery of video content is not necessarily subject to the same franchise obligations applicable to Charter\u2019s traditional cable systems.\nThe FCC administers a program that collects Universal Service Fund contributions from telecommunications service providers and uses them to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in high-cost areas and to low-income consumers and the provision of Internet and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers. A variety of regulatory changes may lead the FCC to expand the collection of Universal Service Fund contributions to encompass Internet service providers. The FCC has begun to redirect the expenditure of Universal Service Fund subsidies to broadband deployment in ways that could assist competitors.\nLocal franchise authorities have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraints on Charter\u2019s business, which could further increase its expenses.\nIn addition to the franchise agreement, cable authorities in some jurisdictions have adopted cable regulatory ordinances that further regulate the operation of cable systems. This additional regulation increases the cost of operating Charter\u2019s business. Local franchising authorities may impose new and more restrictive requirements. Local franchising authorities who are certified to regulate rates in the communities where they operate generally have the power to reduce rates and order refunds on the rates charged for basic service and equipment.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to Charter\u2019s tax positions could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nCharter operates cable systems in locations throughout the United States and, as a result, is subject to the tax laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. From time to time, various legislative and/or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect Charter\u2019s tax positions. There can be no assurance that its effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. Certain states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on Charter\u2019s services or changing the methodologies or base on which certain fees and taxes are computed. Potential changes include additional taxes or fees on Charter\u2019s services which could impact its customers, combined reporting and other changes to general business taxes, central/unit-level assessment of property taxes and other matters that could increase Charter\u2019s income, franchise, sales, use and/or property tax liabilities. In addition, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that Charter\u2019s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that it would be successful in any such challenge.\nFurther regulation of the cable industry could impair Charter\u2019s ability to raise rates to cover its increasing costs, resulting in increased losses.\nCurrently, rate regulation of cable systems is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated equipment and installation activities, and the FCC revised its rules, in response to changed market conditions, to make it more difficult for local franchising authorities to assert rate regulation authority. However, the FCC and Congress continue to be concerned that cable rate increases are exceeding inflation. It is possible that either the FCC or Congress will further restrict the ability of cable system operators to implement rate increases for Charter\u2019s video services or even for its Internet and voice services. Should this occur,\nI-41\nit would impede Charter\u2019s ability to raise its rates. If Charter is unable to raise its rates in response to increasing costs, its financial results would be adversely impacted.\nThere has been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of them available on a standalone, rather than a bundled basis to cable operators, and in requiring cable operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an \u00e0-la-carte basis to consumers. While any new regulation or legislation designed to enable cable operators to purchase programming on a stand-alone basis could be beneficial to Charter, any such new regulation or legislation that limits how Charter sells programming could adversely affect its business.\nChanges in channel carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs on Charter.\nCable operators also face significant regulation of their video channel carriage. Charter can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that it might not carry voluntarily, including certain local broadcast signals; local public, educational and governmental access programming; and unaffiliated, commercial leased access programming (required channel capacity for use by persons unaffiliated with the cable operator who desire to distribute programming over a cable system). The FCC adopted revised commercial leased access rules which would dramatically reduce the rate Charter can charge for leasing this capacity and dramatically increase its administrative burdens, but these remain stayed while under appeal. Legislation has been introduced in Congress in the past that, if adopted, could impact Charter\u2019s carriage of broadcast signals by eliminating the cable industry\u2019s compulsory copyright license. The FCC also continues to consider changes to the rules affecting the relationship between programmers (including broadcasters) and multichannel video distributors, including potential loosening of media ownership rules. Future regulatory changes could disrupt existing programming commitments, interfere with Charter\u2019s preferred use of limited channel capacity, increase its programming costs, and limit its ability to offer services that would maximize its revenue potential. It is possible that other legal restraints will be adopted limiting Charter\u2019s discretion over programming decisions.\nCharter\u2019s voice service is subject to regulatory burdens which may increase, causing it to incur additional costs.\nCharter offers voice communications services over its broadband network using VoIP services. The FCC has ruled that competitive telephone companies that support VoIP services, such as those Charter offers its customers, are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that Charter\u2019s VoIP services can compete in the market. The scope of these interconnection rights is being reviewed in a current FCC proceeding, which may affect Charter\u2019s ability to compete in the provision of voice services or result in additional costs. The FCC has also declared that certain VoIP services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. The full extent of the FCC preemption of state and local regulation of VoIP services is not yet clear, and at least one state (Minnesota) has asserted jurisdiction over Charter\u2019s VoIP services. Charter has filed a legal challenge to that jurisdictional assertion, which is now pending before a federal district court in Minnesota. Telecommunications companies generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to VoIP providers. The FCC has already extended certain traditional telecommunications carrier requirements to many VoIP providers such as Charter. If additional telecommunications regulations are applied to Charter\u2019s VoIP service, it could cause Charter to incur additional costs.\nFactors Relating to Skyhook\nSkyhook faces competition from multiple sources.\nSkyhook\u2019s Wi-Fi location software solutions compete against (1) other satellite and terrestrial based location technology offerings, such as GPS, Observed Time Difference of Arrival and terrestrial beacons (2) other providers of Wi-Fi and cell-based positioning, such as Google and HERE, a former subsidiary of Nokia; and (3) other commercial enterprises\u2019 in-house developed location solutions. There are also a number of new location technologies in development which may further increase competition to be a location solution for new devices and which may require Skyhook to meet more stringent accuracy standards. In addition, Skyhook\u2019s context services compete against other geofencing and location data offerings from other niche location companies, such as Factual and Foursquare.\nCertain of Skyhook\u2019s competitors are substantially larger than Skyhook and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. Thus, many of these large enterprises are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in\nI-42\nspending by customers in its markets, and often have broader product lines and market focus, have greater brand recognition and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a single market. These competitors may also be able to bundle their products together (such as with mapping software) to meet the needs of a particular customer, may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions than Skyhook is able to provide. If large enterprises that currently do not compete directly with Skyhook choose to enter its markets by acquisition or otherwise, competition would likely intensify. In addition, the growth of new location technologies currently in development may further increase competition to provide these new technologies. If Skyhook is not able to compete successfully for customers, its financial position may be materially adversely affected.\nSkyhook is investing in a number of new markets, products and services, but those efforts are still in the early stages and there is no guarantee that such investments will be successful.\nIn addition to its traditional Wi-Fi location software service, Skyhook is also investing significant capital in the development, introduction and sale of its contextual products. Investing in these new markets and technologies - many of which are early stage - necessarily involves significant risks and uncertainties, including the possibility that revenues from such investments will be insufficient to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses, an inadequate return of capital on its investments, and the distraction of management and Skyhook from current operations. Such risks and uncertainties could cause Skyhook to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities.\nSkyhook\u2019s research, development and other investments in new technologies, products or services may not succeed due to, among other things: improvements in alternate technologies in ways that reduce the advantages it anticipates from its investments; competitors\u2019 products or services being more cost effective, having more capabilities or fewer limitations or being brought to market faster than Skyhook\u2019s new products and services; and competitors having longer operating histories in industry segments that are new to Skyhook. Skyhook may also underestimate the costs of or overestimate the future operating income and/or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns. If Skyhook\u2019s new technologies, products or services are not successful, or are not successful in the time frame Skyhook anticipates, Skyhook may incur significant costs and/or asset impairments, its business may not grow as anticipated, its revenues and/or margins may be negatively impacted and/or its reputation may be harmed.\nThe revenue of Skyhook depends on a limited number of customers, and the loss of its more significant customers could adversely affect its business.\nSkyhook derives a significant amount of its revenue from a limited number of customers, and it is anticipated that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of the revenue of Skyhook. Because Skyhook depends on a limited number of customers, the loss of any combination of these customers could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. Certain of these customers may fail to renew their contracts with Skyhook from time to time, creating additional risk with respect to the potential loss of revenue from these customers. The loss or reduction of business from any combination of these existing customers of Skyhook would materially adversely affect revenue, financial condition and results of operations of Skyhook.\nThe revenue of Skyhook depends on the performance of device manufacturers, application developers and other resellers of its technology.\nSkyhook does not sell its Wi-Fi location software solution or context technology directly to end consumers. Instead, Skyhook provides location and context enablement services that integrate with devices, applications and advertising campaigns that are created or distributed by third parties. Accordingly, Skyhook\u2019s future growth significantly depends on third parties successfully incorporating its technology, products and/or services into new device types used in industries beyond traditional cellular communications, such as industrial Internet of Things, connected home and wearable uses. Skyhook also depends on its customers, resellers and licensees to develop products and services with value-added features to drive sales and demand. There can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\nI-43\nSkyhook reported a net operating loss for the year as a result of its investments in new products and markets, and there is no assurance it will be able to attain profitable operations.\nSkyhook reported a net operating loss for the year due to, in part, higher operating expenses related to the aforementioned investments in new markets, products and services. These new investments are intended to replace the revenue that Skyhook lost from the decline of its Uplink-Time Difference of Arrival business and the loss of another large Skyhook customer, as well as to further grow and diversify Skyhook\u2019s revenue stream in a competitive technological environment. There can be no assurance that these investments will drive the revenue growth that is necessary to replace contracts that were lost or that they will be sufficient to achieve profitability.\nThe underlying business and technology of Skyhook depends on the commercial deployment of wireless and other communications technologies and its ability to continue to drive customer demand for Skyhook products and services in a rapidly evolving and developing industry.\nSkyhook develops, patents and commercializes products and services based on wireless and other communications technologies. Skyhook depends on third parties to deploy these wireless technologies and networks in order to operate and deploy Skyhook\u2019s products and services. If third parties do not deploy wireless networks or other communication technologies used by Skyhook to operate its location services, or if new technologies or standards are introduced, it could have a material adverse effect on Skyhook\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of this possibility, Skyhook must stay abreast of rapidly evolving technological developments and offerings (such as the introduction of LoRa Wireless RF technology, a long range, low power consumption and data transmission protocol for Internet of Things devices) to remain competitive and increase the utility of their products and services, and it must be able to incorporate new technologies into its products and services in order to address the needs of its customers. The failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products and services on a timely and cost-competitive basis that complies with evolving industry standards and regulations or the inability to continue to market existing products on a cost-competitive basis could also have a material adverse effect on Skyhook\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, in order to successfully develop and market certain of Skyhook\u2019s products and services, Skyhook may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties. Skyhook cannot provide assurances that it will be able to timely enter into necessary technology development or licensing agreements on reasonable terms, or at all.\nActions taken by Skyhook to protect its intellectual property rights, such as through a licensing program or through litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights, could result in substantial costs, and Skyhook\u2019s ability to compete could be harmed if it fails to take such actions or is unsuccessful in doing so.\nSkyhook relies primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and other methods to protect its intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Skyhook has numerous patents issued, allowed and pending in the United States and/or in foreign jurisdictions which primarily relate to products and the technology used in connection with the products and services it offers. Skyhook cannot be certain that the steps it has taken, or may take in the future, will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of its proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where international treaties, organizations and foreign laws may not protect its proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as United States laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. Any pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved, and any issued patents may not provide Skyhook with competitive advantages, or such issued patents may be challenged, invalidated, infringed, circumvented or misappropriated by third parties.\nWhile Skyhook believes that it has a defensible and useful patent portfolio and it actively seeks to generate revenue through the licensing of its patents and other assets, it cannot assure you that its attempts to secure future patent licenses will be successful or that it will generate meaningful revenue from licensing. In addition, in connection with actively seeking to license and enforce its patents and other intellectual property, Skyhook has in the past been required and may be required in the future to initiate litigation in order to assert claims of infringement of its intellectual property, enforce patents issued or licensed to them, protect their trade secrets or know-how or to determine the scope and/or validity of a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights. Such litigation may involve significant costs and any such litigation could also result in rulings impacting the validity or\nI-44\nenforceability of Skyhook\u2019s patents, which could result in new or increased competition that could have a material adverse effect on Skyhook\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurances that Skyhook would be successful in any such litigation.\nSkyhook could face intellectual property lawsuits from competitors or non-practicing entities.\nOther companies, including some of Skyhook\u2019s largest competitors, hold intellectual property rights in its industry which could inhibit Skyhook\u2019s ability to introduce new products and services unless it secures necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, as the number of issued patents increases and as competition intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may also increase. Skyhook may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by Skyhook or parties that it has agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. Third parties may also claim that employees of Skyhook have misappropriated or divulged their former employers\u2019 trade secrets or confidential information. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome, could subject Skyhook to significant costs or liabilities or require it to cease using proprietary third party technology and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. If infringement claims are made against Skyhook or its products are found to infringe a third parties\u2019 patent or intellectual property, Skyhook or one of its indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third parties\u2019 patent or other intellectual property rights. However, Skyhook may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to it particularly from its competitors. If Skyhook or one of its indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that Skyhook uses or that is used in one of its products, Skyhook could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of its products. It may also have to make royalty or other payments, cross license technology or make payments pursuant to third party indemnitees.\nChanges to the regulatory environment in which Skyhook\u2019s customers operate may negatively impact their business.\nIn the U.S., the FCC regulates wireless carriers, wireless services and E-9-1-1 requirements. FCC regulatory actions affecting wireless carriers and services and E-9-1-1 requirements may adversely affect the wireless phone and device location technology and the positioning services offered by Skyhook. The E-9-1-1 location accuracy requirements originally adopted by the FCC in 1996 applied only to 9-1-1 calls originating outdoors. However, because of the increased use of wireless phones indoors, in 2015, the FCC adopted indoor location accuracy rules its Fourth Report and Order in its E-9-1-1 location accuracy proceeding. Under the FCC\u2019s rules, all wireless providers generally must provide horizontal location information for 40% of all wireless 9-1-1 calls within 2 years of the effective date of the Fourth Report and Order (April 30, 2015), 50% within 3 years of the effective date, 70% within 5 years of the effective date and 80 % within 6 years of the effective date. Wireless providers also must meet specific requirements for the provision of vertical location information for wireless 9-1-1 calls within three-to-eight years of the effective date. Smaller wireless providers may have additional time to comply with certain of the horizontal and vertical benchmarks.\nSkyhook will be actively competing for carrier contracts required to comply with the regulations. Even if Skyhook is able to produce and provide products and services compliant with these regulations, until information regarding any compliant products and services offered by Skyhook\u2019s competitors becomes available, much uncertainty exists as to whether Skyhook will be able to successfully compete for carrier contracts. In addition, due to the aforementioned regulatory changes, uncertainty exists as to the scope and size of revenue from such contracts.\nOther U.S. regulatory agencies also may seek to regulate aspects of the services provided by Skyhook. Further, to the extent Skyhook operates abroad, it is subject to potential action by foreign regulatory agencies. Skyhook cannot anticipate how such additional regulation by the FCC, another U.S. Government agency, or any foreign regulator will affect its business.\nThe success of Skyhook depends on the integrity of its systems and infrastructures.\nSkyhook relies on its enterprise resource planning systems to support such critical business operations as processing sales orders and invoicing, purchasing and supply chain management, human resources and financial reporting. Portions of Skyhook\u2019s IT infrastructure may experience interruptions of service or produce errors in connection with systemic failures, systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. Skyhook may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and\nI-45\nresource-intensive. If Skyhook is unable to successfully implement major systems initiatives and maintain critical information systems, it could encounter difficulties that could have a material adverse impact on its business.\nFurthermore, the businesses of Skyhook depend on delivering products and services to customers of consistently high quality and reliability. If the services offered by Skyhook were to fail or not to perform as expected, its services could be rendered ineffective, and any significant or systemic service failure could also result in a loss of customer confidence, as well as reputational damage, resulting in a material adverse impact on Skyhook\u2019s business.\nI-46\nPrivacy concerns relating to the technology of Skyhook could damage its reputation and deter current and potential users from using its products and applications.\nConcerns about the practices of Skyhook with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of location information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage its reputations and operating results. While Skyhook strives to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as its own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against Skyhook by government entities or others, or could cause it to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on Skyhook\u2019s business.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere is often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the data practices of Skyhook. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring changes in the data practices of Skyhook, which could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of Skyhook. Complying with these various laws could result in the incurrence of substantial costs or require changes to business practices in a manner adverse to the business of Skyhook.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, could compromise the information collected and stored by Skyhook and expose it to liability, which would cause business and reputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Skyhook collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of its customers and suppliers, and location information, in its facilities and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to its operations. Despite security measures in place at Skyhook, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise its networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disruption of operations, reputational damage, and cause a loss of confidence, which could adversely affect Skyhook\u2019s business and revenue.\nFactors Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nWe expect our stock price to continue to be directly affected by the results of operation of Charter and developments in its business.\nThe fair value of our investment in Charter, on an as-converted basis, was approximately $15.6 billion as of December 31, 2016, which represents all of our total market value. As a result, our stock price will continue to be directly affected by the results of operations of Charter and the developments in its business.\nAlthough our Series B common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets, there is no meaningful trading market for the stock.\nOur Series B common stock is not widely held, with approximately 96% of the outstanding shares beneficially owned by John C. Malone, the Chairman of the board and a director of our company. Although it is quoted on the OTC Markets, it is sparsely traded and does not have an active trading market. The OTC Markets tend to be highly illiquid, in part, because there is no national quotation system by which potential investors can track the market price of shares except through information received or generated by a limited number of broker-dealers that make markets in particular stocks. There is also a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the OTC Markets as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system. This volatility is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of readily available price quotations, lower trading volume, absence of consistent administrative supervision of \"bid\" and \"ask\" quotations, and market conditions. Each share of the Series B common stock is convertible, at any time at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock, which is listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"LBRDA.\"\nI-47\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7\nclassifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nrequiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 80% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation; and\n\u00b7\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, John C. Malone currently beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 47% of the aggregate voting power in our company, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 96% of the outstanding shares of our Series B common stock as of January 31, 2017.\nHolders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.\nPrinciples of Delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14988, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "LBRDK"}
