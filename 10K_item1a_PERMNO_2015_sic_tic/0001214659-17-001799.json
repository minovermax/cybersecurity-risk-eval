RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses, we expect to continue to incur losses, and we may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception except for the year ended December 31, 2007. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred a net loss of $27.0 million, and we have an accumulated deficit of $240.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Furthermore, on December 29, 2015, we filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under the Bankruptcy Code. On June 30, 2016, our Second Amended Plan of Reorganization, or the Plan, dated May 9, 2016, as amended, became effective and we emerged from our Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. See \u201cBankruptcy\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report and see \u201cRisks Related to Our Bankruptcy\u201d below for further information on our bankruptcy and emergence from bankruptcy.\nTo date, we have only recognized revenue from payments for funded research and development and for license or collaboration fees. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur additional operating losses in the future to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our accumulated deficit is expected to increase significantly as we continue our development and clinical trial efforts. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for and successfully commercializing our product candidates, either alone or with third parties. We do not currently have the required approvals to market any of our product candidates and we may never receive them. We may not be profitable even if we or any future development partners succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our product candidates, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.\nWe will need substantial additional capital to develop and commercialize our product candidates and to continue as a going concern, but our access to capital funding is uncertain.\nWe will require substantial additional capital to continue as a going concern and to support our business efforts, including obtaining regulatory approvals for benznidazole or other product candidates, clinical trials and other studies, and, if approved, the commercialization of our product candidates. The amount of capital we will require and the timing of our need for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe type, number, timing, progress, costs, and results of the product candidate development programs that we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future;\n\u2022\nthe availability of a 505(b)(2) development pathway for the potential approval by FDA of benznidazole;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, expansion, costs, and results of our pre-clinical and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing of and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe success, progress, timing and costs of our efforts to evaluate or consummate various strategic alternatives if in the best interests of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nour ability to re-list our common stock on a national securities exchange, whether through a new listing or by completing a strategic transaction;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain development partnering arrangements and any associated funding;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing products or technologies and other adverse market developments;\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining, expanding, and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe resources we devote to marketing, and, if approved, commercializing our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, expansion and costs of manufacturing our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with being a public company.\nWe will need to seek additional financing from a number of sources, including, but not limited to, the sale of equity or debt securities, strategic collaborations, and licensing of our product candidates. Additional funding may not be available to us on a timely basis or at acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs. We may also be required to sell or license to others our technologies, product candidates, or development programs that we would have preferred to develop and commercialize ourselves and on less than favorable terms, if at all. If in the best interests of our stockholders, we may also find it appropriate to enter into a strategic transaction that could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination.\nIf management is unsuccessful in efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current levels of operating expenses, our current capital is not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and absent additional financing we may be unable to remain a going concern.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise additional capital, including in the immediate future, based on our current levels of operating expenses, our current capital is not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 were prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. Our ability to meet our liabilities and to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the availability of future funding. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nIn addition, our current financial situation, and the presence of the explanatory paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern, could also make it more difficult to raise the capital necessary to address our current needs.\nWe are exploring strategic alternatives, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any strategic alternative or that any such strategic alternative will yield additional value for our stockholders.\nWe have commenced a review of strategic alternatives to ensure our current structure optimizes our ability to execute our strategic plan and to maximize stockholder value. The review of strategic alternatives could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination, asset divestiture, partnering, licensing or other collaboration agreements, or potential acquisitions or recapitalizations, in one or more transactions, or continuing to operate with our current business plan and strategy. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also cannot assure that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in our current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success of our current product candidates, benznidazole, lenzilumab and ifabotuzumab. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, any of our product candidates.\nIn 2016, we made the strategic decision to focus our efforts on neglected and rare diseases. We have a limited pipeline of product candidates and are not conducting active research at this time for discovery of new molecules or antibodies. We are currently dependent on the successful continued development and regulatory approval of our current product candidates for our future business success. We are investing, and will continue to invest, a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the approval of benznidazole with more limited focus on the development of lenzilumab. We are also seeking partnerships for ifabotuzumab.\nWe intend to pursue the 505(b)(2) approval pathway under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, for benznidazole, which would allow us to rely, at least in part, on literature and clinical data generated by third-party entities. While the 505(b)(2) pathway is most often used for modifications to formulations or for uses for products previously approved by FDA under the 505(b)(1) pathway, we have received preliminary guidance from FDA that a 505(b)(2) pathway is acceptable for benznidazole following our meeting on December 6, 2016. Despite the initial positive guidance received from the FDA following our meeting on December 6, 2016, we cannot guarantee that FDA will ultimately allow us to seek approval for benznidazole under the 505(b)(2) pathway. If FDA does not allow us to utilize this pathway, we may need to conduct original clinical trials to generate data necessary for approval, a process that may require significant financial resources and extend the approval process. Even if FDA allows us to use the 505(b)(2) pathway, it may conclude that our data fails to demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval.\nWe will need to successfully enroll and complete clinical trials of lenzilumab, and potentially obtain regulatory approval to market this product. The future clinical, regulatory and commercial success of our product candidates is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to enroll adequate numbers of eligible patients in the clinical trials we propose to conduct;\n\u2022\nwe may not have sufficient financial and other resources to complete the clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance, or product safety, required by FDA for marketing approval;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain and maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers or establish commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities.\nFurthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. If any of our product candidates are unsuccessful, that could have a substantial negative impact on our business.\nOur product candidates other than benznidazole are at an early stage of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized.\nOur product candidates other than benznidazole are in the early stage of development and will require substantial clinical development, testing, and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. None of our product candidates other than benznidazole have advanced into a pivotal study and it may be years before such a study is initiated, if at all. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete FDA regulatory approval process and are commercialized. We have discontinued the development of prior product candidates after they failed to meet clinical endpoints in non-pivotal trials. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund our development programs, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized. If we or any future development partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for or, if approved, successfully commercialize, one or more of our product candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nFor benznidazole, FDA may disagree with our belief that sufficient clinical safety and efficacy data exist to support FDA approval in treating Chagas disease, and other factors may also prevent us from obtaining approval or from the drug being commercialized.\nNo treatments for Chagas disease are currently approved for marketing in the United States. On June 30, 2016, we acquired from Savant certain regulatory and non-intellectual property assets relating to benznidazole and any product containing benznidazole and an exclusive license of certain intellectual property rights related to benznidazole. We are now working to obtain FDA approval for benznidazole for the treatment of Chagas disease based primarily on data in three categories: (i) clinical trials previously conducted by others for which we have obtained a right to access and use the underlying data, which we plan to analyze, organize, and present to FDA in a new drug application, or NDA; (ii) clinical trials reported in the literature and described in unpublished reports of investigations, for which the underlying data may or may not have been submitted to FDA, and to which we have not obtained rights of access, use, or reference; and (iii) to the extent required by FDA, bioavailability and non-clinical studies that we will perform to bridge the clinical trial data described above using prior formulations of benznidazole to our current formulation, which we believe to be comparable to the prior formulations.\nFor the first category of data, it may turn out that the data to which we obtained rights from Savant and all other data to which we are able to obtain rights are collectively insufficient to establish the clinical safety or efficacy of benznidazole. Even if those data are sufficient, we may be unable to analyze, organize, translate, and present those data adequately to convince FDA that those data establish benznidazole\u2019s safety and efficacy, even if also supported by strong data in the second category of data described above. Although an FDA regulation, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7312.120, permits sponsors to submit and rely on foreign clinical data not collected under a U.S. investigational new drug application, or IND, and another regulation, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7314.106, permits sponsors to rely solely on foreign clinical data as a basis for marketing approval, we may not be able to satisfy the conditions imposed by those regulations. FDA may not grant approval based solely on foreign data, and may require bridging data to account for potentially material differences in patient populations, standards of medical practice, and other variables. We may not be able to generate adequate bridging data. In addition, as discussed further below with respect to the third category of data, FDA may find that even if the data in the first two categories are adequate to establish the safety and efficacy of the prior formulation of benznidazole, our current formulation of benznidazole is not comparable to the prior formulation and, consequently, that the existing clinical safety and efficacy data to which we have rights do not establish the bridge to the safety and efficacy of our current formulation of benznidazole.\nFor the second category of data described above, on which we anticipate needing to rely, at least to some extent, to support the first category in establishing benznidazole\u2019s safety and efficacy, these data may not themselves be adequate to address deficiencies or gaps in the first category of data. Even if adequate, FDA may find the data unconvincing or unreliable, may refuse to rely on them because FDA is not able to review the underlying raw data, may find that reliance under section 505(b)(2) is inappropriate without contractual rights of reference, may not allow use of some or all foreign data which may never have previously been submitted to or reviewed by FDA, or may reject the data for other reasons.\nFor the third category of data described above, it may turn out that our current formulation of benznidazole is not comparable to the prior formulation used in the clinical trials on which we intend to rely. Even if the two formulations are in fact comparable, FDA may reject our bridging data because FDA does not have sufficient information on the prior formulation, because our bridging studies are inadequate and we are unable to supplement or correct them, or for other reasons. In addition, FDA may require lengthy, expensive, or difficult bridging studies for which we have inadequate resources or expertise to complete successfully.\nIf any of the above risks are realized, we may be unable to obtain FDA approval for benznidazole, and even if we do obtain approval, we may not be able to commercialize it successfully and may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business, or may suffer from delays, additional costs, or other obstacles that will material harm our business.\nWe focus on neglected and rare diseases, which may create additional risks and challenges.\nGiven the small number of patients who have certain of the indications that we are targeting and the fact that we intend to treat neglected diseases with certain of our drug candidates, our profitability and growth depend on successfully identifying patients with these diseases and obtaining coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payers, including government payers. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, and market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases, and, as a result, the number of patients with these diseases may turn out to be lower than expected. Our effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in early stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we are unable to locate a sufficient number of eligible patients willing and able to participate in the clinical trials required by FDA or other non-United States regulatory agencies. In addition, if others develop product candidates for the treatment of the same or similar diseases, we would potentially compete with them for the enrollment in these rare patient populations, which may adversely impact the rate of patient enrollment in and the timely completion of our current and planned clinical trials. Additionally, insufficient patient enrollment may be a function of many other factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the timing and magnitude of disease symptom presentation, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. Our inability to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Delays in patient enrollment in the future as a result of these and other factors may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our clinical trials, which could prevent us from completing these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates.\nAdditionally, the potentially addressable patient population for each of our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Finally, even if we obtain significant market share for our product candidates, because the potential target populations are very small and in some cases may not have access to medical coverage, whether through insurance or government programs, we may never achieve profitability despite obtaining such market share.\nOur business model is predicated on expected benefits from various regulatory incentives, such as orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, priority review and priority review vouchers, or PRVs, and we may not ultimately qualify for or benefit from these arrangements.\nBecause we focus on developing drugs as treatments for neglected and rare diseases, we may seek various regulatory incentives, such as orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and PRVs, where available, that provide for certain periods of exclusivity, expedited review and/or other benefits, and we may also seek similar designations elsewhere in the world. We also anticipate benefitting from New Chemical Entity, or NCE, status under the Hatch-Waxman Act for benznidazole and other future drug candidates that qualify. Often, regulatory agencies have broad discretion in determining whether or not products qualify for such regulatory incentives and benefits. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to receive orphan drug or NCE status from FDA or equivalent regulatory designations elsewhere. We also cannot guarantee that we will obtain breakthrough therapy or fast track designation, which may provide certain potential benefits such as more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, and potential eligibility for rolling review or priority review. Legislative developments in the U.S., including recent proposed legislation that would restrict eligibility for PRVs, may affect our ability to qualify for these programs in the future.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining beneficial regulatory designations by FDA or other regulatory agency for our product candidates, such designations may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may not be able to obtain or maintain such designations for our product candidates, and our competitors may obtain these designations for their product candidates, which could impact our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or compete with such competitors, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business model is predicated on the availability of PRVs, particularly for benznidazole, but our product candidates may not qualify for or receive a PRV, and changes to the applicable programs could limit our ability to benefit from a PRV.\nUnder Section 524 of the FDCA, the FDA is authorized to award PRVs to the sponsors of NDAs and BLAs for novel products targeting specific tropical diseases. Similarly, FDA\u2019s rare pediatric disease PRV program allows FDA to grant PRVs to NDA or BLA sponsors who receive approval for a product targeting a rare pediatric disease, defined as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., and where at least 50% of the patients are aged from birth to 18 years. Under these PRV programs, PRV-holders can redeem their voucher to receive an accelerated six-month FDA action goal instead of the standard ten-month window, or they may sell or transfer their PRV to another sponsor. A product only qualifies for a PRV if it contains active ingredients that have never before been approved by FDA. See \u201cGovernment Regulation-Tropical Disease PRVs\u201d and \u201c-Rare Pediatric Disease PRVs\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report for more information on the PRV programs.\nWe believe that benznidazole and lenzilumab or other future product candidates that we may develop or acquire may qualify for PRVs, and in particular we believe investors in our company place significant value on the potential to obtain a PRV for benznidazole. We have received a preliminary, non-binding opinion from FDA that, if approved first as described above, benznidazole would meet the criteria for voucher eligibility, which is reflected in the minutes from our December 6, 2016 pre-IND face-to-face meeting with FDA. We have no assurance, however, that benznidazole, lenzilumab or any other product candidate we pursue in the future will qualify for a PRV, including because another party may receive FDA approval for a product containing an active ingredient in our products prior to our receiving approval, which is a particular risk in the case of benznidazole. Furthermore, we have no assurance that there will be a market for the sale of PRVs, or that the PRV programs will not be restricted, changed or eliminated or that, with respect to certain elements, will be left to expire. Restrictions and changes to, or the elimination or expiration of, the PRV programs would have an adverse effect on our business and potential for realizing value from our focus on neglected and rare diseases, which could impact the willingness of investors to provide additional capital and our ability to ultimately return value to our shareholders.\nThere is a limited amount of information about us upon which investors can evaluate our product candidates and business prospects, including because we have a limited operating history developing product candidates, have not yet successfully commercialized any products, have changed our strategy and our management team, and emerged from bankruptcy.\nDuring 2016, we changed our management team and embarked upon a new strategy in conjunction with our emergence from bankruptcy on June 30, 2016. Our relatively new team, strategic business focus and limited operating history developing clinical-stage product candidates may make it difficult for us to succeed or for investors to be able to evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, as an early-stage clinical development company, we have limited experience in development activities, including conducting clinical trials, or seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals. We are also heavily dependent at this time on external consultants for scientific and regulatory expertise. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the biopharmaceutical area. For example, to execute our business plan we will need to successfully:\n\u2022\ncomplete development activities and successfully submit for regulatory approval an NDA for benznidazole;\n\u2022\nexecute our product candidate development activities, including successfully completing our clinical trial programs;\n\u2022\nobtain required regulatory approvals for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nmanage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to clinical trials, regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercialization;\n\u2022\nsecure substantial additional funding;\n\u2022\ndevelop and maintain successful strategic relationships;\n\u2022\nbuild and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nbuild and maintain appropriate clinical, sales, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing capabilities on our own or through third parties; and\n\u2022\ngain market acceptance and favorable reimbursement status for our product candidates.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop product candidates, raise capital, expand our business, or continue our operations.\nWe have and may continue to experience delays in commencing or conducting our clinical trials, in receiving data from third parties or in the continuation or completion of clinical testing, which could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate product candidate revenue.\nBefore we can initiate clinical trials in the United States for any new product candidates, we are required to submit the results of preclinical testing to FDA as part of an IND, along with other information including information about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and our proposed clinical trial protocol. For our programs already underway, we are required to report or provide information to appropriate regulatory authorities in order to continue with our testing programs. If we are unable to make timely regulatory submissions for any of our programs, it will delay our plans for our clinical trials. If those third parties do not make the required data available to us, we will likely have to identify and contract with another third party, and/or develop all necessary preclinical and clinical data on our own, which will lead to significant delays and increase development costs of the product candidate. In addition, FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical testing for any product candidate before it allows us to initiate clinical testing under any IND, which may lead to additional delays and increase the costs of our preclinical development. Moreover, despite the presence of an active IND for a product candidate, clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, and enrolling qualified subjects to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject to modification from time to time, and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials, either as a result of transferring the manufacturing of a product candidate to another site or manufacturer, deferring ordering or production of product in order to conserve resources or mitigate risk, having product in inventory become no longer suitable for use in humans, or other reasons that reduce or delay availability of drug supply;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at an existing or prospective site;\n\u2022\nretaining or replacing participants who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process, or personal issues;\n\u2022\ndeveloping any companion diagnostic necessary to ensure that the study enrolls the target population; or\n\u2022\nundergoing a clinical trial put on clinical hold at any time by FDA during product candidate development.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, recruitment and enrollment of subjects may be slower than we anticipate. Numerous companies and institutions are conducting clinical studies in similar patient populations which can result in competition for qualified patients. In addition, clinical trials will take longer than we anticipate if we are required, or believe it is necessary, to enroll additional subjects. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, an ethics committee, or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022\ninspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ninability to provide timely supply of drug product;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues, known safety issues that occur at a greater frequency or severity than we anticipate, or any determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; or\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nAdditionally, if any future development partners do not develop the licensed product candidates in the time and manner that we expect, or at all, the clinical development efforts related to these licensed product candidates could be delayed or terminated. In addition, our ability to enforce our partners\u2019 obligations under any future collaboration efforts may be limited due to time and resource constraints, competing corporate priorities of our future partners, and other factors.\nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials may delay or preclude our ability to further develop or pursue regulatory approval for our product candidates. Changes in U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements and guidance also may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may affect the costs, timing, and likelihood of a successful completion of a clinical trial. If we or any future development partners experience delays in the completion of, or if we or any future development partners must terminate, any clinical trial of any product candidate our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer as a result. In addition, many of these factors may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, compliance with which is costly and time consuming, may cause unanticipated delays, or may prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe clinical development, approval, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing, and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval from FDA. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive, often takes many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the products involved, as well as the target indications. Approval policies or regulations may change and FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.\nFDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nsuch authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our or any future development partners\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe or any future development partners may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of FDA or other regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u2022\nsuch authorities may not accept clinical data from trials that are conducted at clinical facilities or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy required by such authorities for approval;\n\u2022\nwe or any future development partners may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nsuch authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical;\n\u2022\nsuch authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or any future development partners contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of such authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our or any future development partners\u2019 clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary widely among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods, and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased caution by FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new drugs based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us, or any future development partners from commercializing our product candidates.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not always predictive of future results. Any product candidate we or any future development partners advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval.\nDrug development has substantial inherent risk. We or any future development partners will be required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target populations for their intended indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of development, including after commencement of any of our clinical trials. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. In addition, serious adverse or undesirable side effects may emerge or be identified during later stages of development that were not observed in earlier stages. Furthermore, our future trials will need to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy for approval by regulatory authorities in larger patient populations. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. In addition, only a small percentage of drugs under development result in the submission of a New Drug Application or Biologic License Application, or BLA, to FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and clinical development personnel, we may be unable to successfully manage our business and develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe will need to effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, and other resources in order to successfully pursue our clinical development and commercialization efforts. As a company with a limited number of personnel, we are heavily affected by turnover and highly dependent on the expertise of the members of our senior management, in particular our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Cameron Durrant. Furthermore, we rely on third party consultants for a variety of services, and our Interim Chief Financial Officer is not an employee of ours, but instead provides services to us pursuant to a consulting arrangement we have entered into with a third party that employs him. We cannot predict the impact of the loss of such individuals or the loss of services of any of our other senior management, should they occur, or the difficulty in replacing such individuals. Such losses could delay or prevent the further development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and, if we are not successful in finding suitable replacements, could harm our business.\nOur success also depends on our continued ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified management, scientific and other expert personnel and we may not be able to do so in the future due to recent events, and intense competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, universities, and research organizations for qualified personnel. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, we may experience significant impediments to our ability to implement our business strategy.\nAny product candidate we or any future development partners advance into clinical trials may cause unacceptable adverse events or have other properties that may delay or prevent its regulatory approval or commercialization or limit its commercial potential.\nUnacceptable adverse events caused by any of our product candidates that we advance into clinical trials could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This in turn could prevent us from completing development or commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenue from its sale. For example, we observed fatal intracranial hemorrhages in three subjects deemed possibly related to the study drug by the study investigator in our ifabotuzumab Phase 1 clinical trial and, as a result, we amended our clinical protocol, which caused a delay in our program, but which resulted in no similar subsequent events.\nWe have not yet successfully completed testing of any of our product candidates for the treatment of the indications for which we intend to seek approval in humans, and we currently do not know the extent of adverse events, if any, that will be observed in individuals who receive any of our product candidates, except for benznidazole, for which the safety profile is well known and which we will document in our NDA primarily through foreign clinical data. If any of our product candidates cause unacceptable adverse events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product candidates.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for the target indications of our product candidates that are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or are demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our product candidates, or if FDA approves generic competitors to our products post-approval, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe compete in an industry characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, a changing regulatory and legislative landscape and a strong emphasis on the benefits of intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivities. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, other biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other private and public research organizations. We compete with these parties for therapies for neglected and rare diseases and in recruiting highly qualified personnel. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with established therapies, with new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors, including competitors relying to a large extent on our drug approvals under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or on our biologics approvals under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act, or with generic copies of our products approved by FDA under an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, referencing our drug products. We believe that competitors are actively developing competing products to our product candidates, including other companies that are pursuing benznidazole for treatment of Chagas disease in the United States. See \u201cCompetition\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report for a discussion of competition with respect to our current product candidates.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, marketing, sales and human resources capabilities than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful with respect to their products than we may be in developing, commercializing, and achieving widespread market acceptance for our products. If a competitor obtains approval for an orphan drug that is the same drug or the same biologic as one of our candidates before we do, we will be blocked from obtaining FDA approval for seven years from the date of the competitor\u2019s product, unless we can establish that our product is clinically superior to the previously-approved competitor\u2019s product or we can meet another exception, such as by showing that the competitor has failed to provide an adequate supply of its product to patients after approval. In addition, our competitors\u2019 products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we or our development partners may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses related to developing and supporting the commercialization of any of our product candidates. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. After one of our product candidates is approved, FDA may also approve a generic version with the same dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use as our product. These generic equivalents would be less costly to bring to market and could generally be offered at lower prices, thereby limiting our ability to gain or retain market share.\nThe acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to in-license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. The more established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows, institutional experience and historical corporate reputation.\nWe are subject to a multitude of manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our products.\nWe are, and will for the foreseeable future continue to be, wholly dependent on third party contract manufacturers for the timely supply of adequate quantities of our products which meet or exceed requisite quality and production standards for use in clinical and nonclinical studies. Given the extensive risks, scope, complexity, cost, regulatory requirements and commitment of resources associated with developing the capabilities to manufacture one or more of our products, we have no present plan or intention of developing in-house manufacturing capabilities for nonclinical, clinical or commercial scale production, beyond our current supervision and management of our third party contract manufacturers. In addition, in order to balance risk and conserve financial and human resources, we have and may continue from time to time to defer commitment to production of product, which could result in delays to the continued progress of our clinical and nonclinical testing.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to several risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nWe, and our contract manufacturers, must comply with FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations and guidance. We, and our contract manufacturers, may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. We, and our contract manufacturers, are subject to inspections by FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure to follow cGMP or other regulatory requirements or any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to comply with regulatory requirements, or a failure to pass any regulatory authority inspection, could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products, including leading to significant delays in the availability of products for our clinical studies or the termination or hold on a clinical study, or the delay or prevention of a filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of sanctions, including injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approvals for our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, adverse publicity, and criminal prosecutions, any of which could damage our reputation. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, injunctions, or criminal prosecution. Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives.\n\u00b7\nThe manufacturing facilities in which our products are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, plant closures, capacity constraints, competing customer priorities or changes in corporate strategy or priorities, process changes or failures, changes in business models or operations, materials or labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors.\n\u00b7\nWe are wholly dependent upon third party CMOs for the timely supply of adequate quantities of requisite quality product for our nonclinical, clinical and, if approved by regulatory authorities, commercial scale production.\n\u00b7\nThe process of manufacturing biologics is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment, or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination.\nWe may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates or obtaining necessary rights to product candidates for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nOur strategy involves identifying, acquiring, developing and supporting the commercialization of additional treatments for neglected and rare disease. However, we may be unable to identify, acquire or in-license any product candidates from third parties for various reasons, including because we are focusing on a specific type of product candidates, and we may be unable to identify product candidates that we believe are an appropriate strategic fit for our company.\nThe in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to in-license or acquire product candidates that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, financial resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to in-license or acquire the relevant product candidate on terms that would allow us to generate an appropriate return on our investment.\nIn addition, we expect that competition for the in-licensing or acquisition of product candidates that are attractive to us may increase in the future, which may mean fewer suitable opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition or licensing prices. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable product candidates, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nIf any product candidate that we successfully develop does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers and the medical community, the revenue that it generates may be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers, and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payers, including government payers, generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics, and patients of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022\nunfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payers, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from that product candidate and may not become or remain profitable.\nReimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors including the third-party payer\u2019s determination that use of a product candidate is:\n\u2022\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022\nsafe, effective, and medically necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022\ncost-effective; and\n\u2022\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product candidate from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical, and cost effectiveness data for the use of our product candidates to the payer. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels or with restrictions, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our product candidates profitably, or at all, even if approved.\nIn the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. In particular, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 revised the payment methods for many product candidates under Medicare. This has resulted in lower rates of reimbursement. There have been numerous other federal and state initiatives designed to reduce payment for pharmaceuticals.\nAs a result of legislative proposals and the trend toward managed health care in the United States, third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may also refuse to provide coverage of approved product candidates for medical indications other than those for which FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payers will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs. Even with our focus on our Responsible Pricing Model, we could be subject to pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative proposals as well as country, regional, or local healthcare budget limitations.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or fail to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell any product candidates we may successfully develop, we may not be able to effectively market and sell any such product candidates.\nWe do not currently have the sales and marketing infrastructure in place that would be necessary to sell and market products. As our drug candidates progress, while we may build the infrastructure that would be needed to successfully market and sell any successful drug candidate, we currently anticipate seeking strategic alliances and partnerships with third parties, particularly for any drug candidates that we determine would require larger sales efforts. The establishment of a sales and marketing operation can be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product candidate launch. Whether directly or through third parties, we intend to responsibly price any approved products using our Responsible Pricing Model, which could make it more difficult to enter into arrangements with third parties on acceptable terms, if at all.\nGovernments may impose price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe intend to seek approval to market our future product candidates in the United States and potentially in foreign jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our product candidates. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe face potential product liability exposure and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims may be brought against us or any future development partners by participants enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, health care providers, or others using, administering, or selling our product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, or have insufficient insurance protection, we would incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or other claimants;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates and loss of revenue;\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials domestically and in selected foreign countries where we are conducting clinical trials. As such, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage for product candidates to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development; however, we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product candidates approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our working capital and adversely affect our business.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which leaves us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, auto, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Our recent history may result in an increase in premium costs or otherwise affect the terms of coverage available to us. Any significant, uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our working capital and results of operations.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to provide accurate information to FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to comply with manufacturing standards, failure to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to report financial information or data accurately, violations of anti-bribery laws, or failure to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of confidential information obtained in the course of our business, which could result in civil or criminal legal actions, regulatory sanctions, or serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we seek to advance our product candidates through clinical trials we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, and sales capabilities, and contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various development partners, suppliers, and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nWe and any future development partners, third-party manufacturers and suppliers use hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage, or disposal of these materials could be time consuming or costly.\nWe and any future development partners, third-party manufacturers and suppliers may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations and the operations of our development partner, third-party manufacturers and suppliers also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property, casualty, and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our future development partners, third-party clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our development partners, third-party clinical research organizations and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nHealthcare reform measures, when implemented, could hinder or prevent our commercial success.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of health care and containing or lowering the cost of health care. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payers of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nthe demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u2022\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital.\nWe and any of our future development partners will be required to report to regulatory authorities if any of our approved products cause or contribute to adverse medical events, and any failure to do so would result in sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nIf we and any future development partners are successful in commercializing our products, FDA and foreign regulatory authorities would require that we and any future development partners report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We and any future development partners may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We and any future development partners may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we and any future development partners fail to comply with our reporting obligations, FDA or a foreign regulatory authority could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nOur product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, as part of the Affordable Care Act, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u2018\u2018interchangeable\u2019\u2019 based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that any of our product candidates approved as biological products under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Finally, there is a risk that the 12-year exclusivity period could be reduced which could negatively affect our products.\nIn addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products. For example, biological products in Europe may be eligible for a 10-year period of exclusivity. However, biosimilar products have been approved under a sub-pathway of the centralized procedure since 2006. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar product to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar product has been demonstrated to be \u2018\u2018similar.\u2019\u2019 In many cases, this allows biosimilar products to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. It is unclear whether we and our development partner would face competition to our products in European markets sooner than anticipated.\nWe may in the future be subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and fraud laws, and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties.\nIf one or more of our product candidates is approved, we will likely be subject to the various U.S. federal and state laws intended to prevent health care fraud and abuse. The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payers. Violations of the anti-kickback laws can result in exclusion from federal health care programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties.\nThe False Claims Act imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The False Claims Act has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. The False Claims includes a whistleblower provision that allows individuals to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and share a portion of the recovery of successful claims. If our marketing or other arrangements were determined to violate the False Claims Act or anti-kickback or related laws, then our revenue could be adversely affected, which would likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nState and federal authorities have aggressively targeted medical technology companies for alleged violations of these anti-fraud statutes, based on improper research or consulting contracts with doctors, certain marketing arrangements that rely on volume-based pricing, off-label marketing schemes, and other improper promotional practices. Companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans or Corporate Integrity Agreements, and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our contractual relationships with providers or institutions, or our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business.\nAlso, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties, or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the United States may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our current product candidates or any future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u2022\nchanges to manufacturing methods;\n\u2022\nadditional studies, including clinical studies;\n\u2022\nrecall, replacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n\u2022\nadditional record keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will continue to be subject to ongoing and extensive regulatory requirements, and our failure to comply with these requirements could substantially harm our business.\nIf we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review, such as continued safety reporting requirements, and we may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls or seizures.\nIf FDA approves any of our product candidates, the labeling, manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, export, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping for our products will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Violations of these regulatory requirements or the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the products, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in:\n\u2022\nthe issuance of warning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marking clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing and distribution of the product, including potential withdrawal of the product from the market;\n\u2022\nsuspension of ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of product recalls, import and export restrictions, seizures, and detentions; and\n\u2022\nthe issuance of injunctions, or imposition of other civil and/or criminal penalties.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. We may be unable to use these losses to offset income before such unused losses expire. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u2018\u2018ownership change\u2019\u2019 (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have in the past experienced ownership changes that have resulted in limitations on the use of a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards. If we experience further ownership changes our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could be further limited.\nRisks Related to Our Bankruptcy\nDespite having emerged from bankruptcy, we cannot be certain that the residual effects of the bankruptcy proceedings will not adversely affect our operations going forward.\nBecause of the residual risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the ultimate impact of events that occurred in connection with, or that may occur subsequent to, these proceedings will have on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022\nkey business partners could terminate their relationships or require financial assurances or enhanced performance\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability to renew existing contracts and negotiate favorable terms from suppliers, partners and others may be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nemployees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities\u037e and\n\u2022\nother costs of operations, including obtaining insurance, could be more expensive.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events, or others related to our emergence from bankruptcy, could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy proceedings will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nAllowance of claims by the Bankruptcy Court could materially exceed our estimated liability and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe reconciliation of certain proofs of claim filed against the Company in the Bankruptcy Case is ongoing. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $850,000 in claims remain subject to review and reconciliation by the Company. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has recorded $130,000 and $124,000 related to these claims in Accounts payable and Notes payable to vendors, respectively, which represents management\u2019s best estimate of claims to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court.\nDespite management\u2019s best estimate of claims to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, the Company may be ultimately unsuccessful in its attempt to have certain proofs of claim that it believes are subject to objection or otherwise improperly filed to be disallowed, reduced or reclassified by the Bankruptcy Court. The allowance of claims by the Bankruptcy Court could materially exceed our estimated liability and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we may identify additional liabilities during this process that will need to be recorded or reclassified to liabilities subject to compromise. The resolution of such claims could result in material adjustments to our financial statements.\nFor additional information, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have experienced significant changes in our management team, Board of Directors and business strategy in connection with our bankruptcy and our emergence from bankruptcy.\nWe emerged from bankruptcy with a new management team and a substantially changed Board of Directors, as well as a new business plan and strategy focused on the treatment of neglected and rare diseases. The new management team and directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. In the future, we may have additional turnover in the members of our management team or the Board. Any such future turnover may require time, effort and cost and may divert the attention of the management team and Board away from our operations and business objectives. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to pivot our business strategy to focus on neglected and rare diseases.\nOur actual financial results may vary significantly from the projections filed with the Bankruptcy Court and, as a result of our bankruptcy, our historical financial information is not comparable to future financial information.\nIn connection with the Plan, we were required to prepare projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon emergence from bankruptcy. These projections were limited by the information available to us as of the date they were prepared and reflected numerous assumptions concerning anticipated future performance and prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and continue to be beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks. Therefore, variations from the projections may be material. These projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings, have not been incorporated into this report, have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be considered or relied upon by investors.\nAdditionally, as a result of the consummation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby, our financial condition and results of operations from and after our emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet our deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. Therefore, the timing of the initiation and completion of these trials is uncertain and may occur on substantially different timing from our estimates. We also use CROs to conduct our clinical trials and rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, CROs, and consultants to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and regulatory requirements. Our CROs, investigators, and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and subsequent collection and analysis of data.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators, or other third parties on which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fails to meet expected deadlines, fails to adhere to our clinical protocols, or otherwise performs in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated. If any of our clinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on subjects enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer those subjects to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be jeopardized.\nWe rely completely on third parties, most of which are sole source suppliers, to supply drug substance and manufacture drug product for our clinical trials and preclinical studies and intend to rely on other third parties to produce commercial supplies of product candidates, and our dependence on third parties could adversely impact our business.\nWe are completely dependent on third-party suppliers, most of which are sole source suppliers of the drug substance and drug product for our product candidates. We are continually evaluating potential alternate sources of supply but there can be no assurance that any such suppliers would be available, acceptable or successful. From time to time, we experience delays from our drug substance suppliers. To date, such delays have been manageable. However, if these third-party suppliers do not supply sufficient quantities for product candidates to us on a timely basis and in accordance with applicable specifications and other regulatory requirements, there could be a significant interruption of our supplies, which would adversely affect clinical development of the product candidate, including affecting our ability to enroll in and timely progress clinical trials. Furthermore, if any of our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and with regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval, if any, for our product candidates.\nWe will also rely on our contract manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our product candidates. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our contract manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have agreements in place for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of that clinical trial, product candidate testing, and potential regulatory approval of that product candidate.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to commercially manufacture any of our proposed product candidates if approved, and will likely continue to be dependent on third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply us with clinical trial materials and any approved product candidates may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining additional development partnerships and licensing agreements, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nPart of our strategy is to enter into development partnerships and licensing agreements. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex. Even if we are successful in securing a development partnership, we may not be able to continue it. For example, in July 2014, we terminated our prior development partnership with Sanofi for KB001-A. We cannot predict the impact of that decision on the likelihood of our ability to enter into future partnerships for KB001-A or for our other programs. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a development partnership or other alternative arrangements for any of our other existing or future product candidates and programs because, among other reasons, our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early a stage of development for collaborative effort and/or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish new development partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us and we may not be able to maintain such development partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product candidate are disappointing. Any delay in entering into new development partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness if they reach the market.\nMoreover, if we fail to establish and maintain additional development partnerships related to our product candidates:\n\u2022\nthe development of our current or future product candidates may be terminated or delayed;\n\u2022\nour cash expenditures related to development of certain of our current or future product candidates would increase significantly and we may need to seek additional financing;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to hire additional employees or otherwise develop expertise, such as sales and marketing expertise, for which we have not budgeted; and\n\u2022\nwe will bear all of the risk related to the development of any such product candidates.\nOur or any new partner\u2019s failure to develop, manufacture or effectively commercialize our product would result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish, and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and licensees to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We have an active patent protection program that includes filing patent applications on new compounds, formulations, delivery systems and methods of making and using products and prosecuting these patent applications in the United States and abroad. As patents issue, we also file continuation applications as appropriate. Although we have taken steps to build a strong patent portfolio, we cannot predict:\n\u00b7\nthe degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our licensed patents;\n\u00b7\nif and when patents will issue in the United States or any other country;\n\u00b7\nwhether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our licensed patents and patent applications;\n\u00b7\nwhether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights, which may be costly whether we win or lose;\n\u00b7\nwhether any of our patents will be challenged by our competitors alleging invalidity or unenforceability and, if opposed or litigated, the outcome of any administrative or court action as to patent validity, enforceability or scope;\n\u00b7\nwhether a competitor will develop a similar compound that is outside the scope of protection afforded by a patent or whether the patent scope is inherent in the claims modified due to interpretation of claim scope by a court;\n\u00b7\nwhether there were activities previously undertaken by a licensor that could limit the scope, validity or enforceability of licensed patents and intellectual property; or\n\u00b7\nwhether a competitor will assert infringement of its patents or intellectual property, whether or not meritorious, and what the outcome of any related litigation or challenge may be.\nOur success also depends upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants and advisors as well as our licensors, sublicensees and contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, we require all employees, consultants and board members to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired, and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nDue to legal and factual uncertainties regarding the scope and protection afforded by patents and other proprietary rights, we may not have meaningful protection from competition.\nOur long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our patent rights, and the patent rights of biopharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. These uncertainties also mean that any patents that we own or may obtain in the future could be subject to challenge, and even if not challenged, may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition. Patents already issued to us or our pending applications may become subject to dispute, and any dispute could be resolved against us.\nIf some or all of our or any licensor\u2019s patents expire or are invalidated or are found to be unenforceable, or if some or all of our patent applications do not result in issued patents or result in patents with narrow, overbroad, or unenforceable claims, or claims that are not supported in regard to written description or enablement by the specification, or if we are prevented from asserting that the claims of an issued patent cover a product of a third party, we may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates, including in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for our product candidates, as well as the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates. We will be able to protect our product candidates and the methods for treating patients in the applicable product indications using these product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we or our exclusive licensor owns or controls such valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets.\nEven if our product candidates and the methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Our and any licensor\u2019s ability to obtain patents can be highly uncertain and involve complex and in some cases unsettled legal issues and factual questions. Furthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us or any licensor, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the utility, written description or enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nWe may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates, or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection. Even if patents are issued to us or any licensor regarding our product or methods of using them, those patents can be challenged by our competitors who can argue such patents are invalid or unenforceable on a variety of grounds, including lack of utility, lack sufficient written description or enablement, utility, or that the claims of the issued patents should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these products without legally infringing our patents. The current U.S. regulatory environment may have the effect of encouraging companies to challenge branded drug patents or to create non-infringing versions of a patented product in order to facilitate the approval of abbreviated new drug applications for generic substitutes. These same types of incentives encourage competitors to submit new drug applications that rely on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by the drug sponsor, providing another less burdensome pathway to approval.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and be forced to defend against litigation and pay damages.\nThere is a risk that we are infringing the proprietary rights of third parties because numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields that are the focus of our development and manufacturing efforts. Others might have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our or any licensor\u2019s pending patent applications and issued patents and/or might have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. In addition, because patent applications take many months to publish and patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us or any licensor, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates. In addition, the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates may infringe existing patents of which we are not aware. Defending ourselves against third-party claims, including litigation in particular, would be costly and time consuming and would divert management\u2019s attention from our business, which could lead to delays in our development or commercialization efforts. If third parties are successful in their claims, we might have to pay substantial damages or take other actions that are adverse to our business.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and may have to:\n\u00b7\nobtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\nredesign our products or processes to avoid infringement, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time;\n\u00b7\nstop using the subject matter claimed in patents held by others, which could cause us to lose the use of one or more of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\npay damages royalties, or other amounts; or\n\u00b7\ngrant a cross license to our patents to another patent holder.\nWe expect that, as our drug candidates move further into clinical trials and commercialization and our public profile is raised, we will be more likely to be subject to such claims.\nWe may fail to comply with any of our obligations under existing agreements pursuant to which we license or have otherwise acquired rights or technology, which could result in the loss of rights or technology that are material to our business.\nWe are a party to technology licenses and have acquired certain assets and rights that are important to our business and we may enter into additional licenses or acquire additional assets and rights in the future. We currently hold licenses from the Medical College of Wisconsin, UCSF, LICR, BioWa, Lonza, and Sanofi and have acquired certain assets and rights from Savant. These licenses and acquisition agreements impose various commercial, contingent payments, royalty, insurance, indemnification, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor or Savant may have the right to terminate the license or take back rights or assets, in which event we would lose valuable rights under our collaboration agreements and our ability to develop product candidates.\nWe may be subject to claims that our consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers to us.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates. Many of these consultants were previously employed at, or may have previously or may be currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that our company or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and we intend to seek patent protection only in selected countries. Our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere is a limited trading market for our securities. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nOn January 13, 2016, our common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market, and our common stock is no longer listed on any national or regional securities exchange. Although our common stock is listed for quotation on the OTC Pink marketplace operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc., trading is limited and we cannot predict whether an active market for our common stock will ever develop in the future. In the absence of an active trading market:\n\u2022\ninvestors may have difficulty buying and selling shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket visibility for shares of our common stock may be limited;\n\u2022\na lack of visibility for shares of our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nsignificant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAn inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue as a going concern and to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets by using our shares as consideration.\nThe OTC Pink marketplace is a relatively unorganized, inter-dealer, over-the-counter market that provides significantly less liquidity than NASDAQ, the NYSE or the NYSE MKT. No assurance can be given that an active market will develop for the common stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the common stock. The common stock may be traded only infrequently in transactions arranged through brokers or otherwise, and reliable market quotations may not be available.\nOur ability to re-list our common stock on a national securities exchange is subject to us meeting applicable listing criteria.\nWe intend to apply for our common stock to be re-listed on a national securities exchange. In addition, we are exploring numerous strategic transactions to effect a listing on a national securities exchange, including by completing a reverse merger or sale. However, no assurances can be given regarding our ability to achieve a listing in a timely manner or at all. Each national securities exchange requires companies desiring to list their common stock to meet certain listing criteria including total number of stockholders, minimum stock price, total value of public float, and in some cases total shareholders\u2019 equity and market capitalization. Our failure to meet such applicable listing criteria will prevent us from listing our common stock on a national securities exchange. In the event we are unable to uplist our common stock, our common stock will continue to trade on the OTC Pink marketplace operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance could result in further dilution to our stockholders.\nAny future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including, among other restrictions, limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation, or asset sale transactions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to grant potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nAny material weaknesses in our internal control over financing reporting in the future could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our common stock and increase our cost of raising capital.\nIf we are unable to maintain our financial controls, or we identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the future, our operating results might be harmed, we may fail to meet our reporting obligations or fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could, in turn, affect the future ability of our management to certify that internal control over our financial reporting is effective. Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our share price. Furthermore, deficiencies could result in future non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such non-compliance could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including review by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nOur stock price is volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price is volatile and from January 31, 2013, the first day of trading of our common stock, to March 7, 2017, our stock had high and low sales prices in the range of $66.00 to $0.44 per share. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and others such as:\n\u2022\nthe availability of a 505(b)(2) development pathway for the potential approval by FDA of benznidazole;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure in initiating or completing preclinical studies or clinical trials, or unsatisfactory results of these trials and the resulting impact on ongoing product development;\n\u2022\nthe success, progress, timing and costs of our efforts to evaluate or consummate various strategic alternatives if in the best interests of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nour ability to re-list our common stock on a national securities exchange, whether through a new listing or by completing a strategic transaction;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding equity or debt financing transactions;\n\u2022\nsales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements about us or about our competitors including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, or new product candidate introductions;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our development partner, licensors or product candidate manufacturers;\n\u2022\nlitigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nconditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries and the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation and legislation;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of members of our board of directors, management team or other key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating results;\n\u2022\nany financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, our failure to meet these projections, or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nchange in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations; and\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market or resulting from inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares.\nIn recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the companies whose stock is experiencing those price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained or may be volatile.\nWe have a limited number of shares publicly available for purchase. An active trading market may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration. In addition, the public market for our shares may be extremely volatile in light of the results of our operations, our limited resources, the number of products we may have in development at any given time, and numerous other factors.\nOur common stock may be considered to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and, as such, any market for our common stock may be further limited by certain SEC rules applicable to penny stocks.\nTo the extent the price of our common stock remains below $5.00 per share, our common stock will be subject to certain \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated by the SEC. Those rules impose certain sales practice requirements on brokers who sell penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000). For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, the broker must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale. Furthermore, the penny stock rules generally require, among other things, that brokers engaged in secondary trading of penny stocks provide customers with written disclosure documents, monthly statements of the market value of penny stocks, disclosure of the bid and asked prices and disclosure of the compensation to the brokerage firm and disclosure of the sales person working for the brokerage firm. These rules and regulations adversely affect the ability of brokers to sell our common stock and limits the liquidity of our common stock.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur directors, executive officers, and the holders of more than 5% of our common stock together with their affiliates beneficially own approximately 75% of our common stock as of March 7, 2017. These stockholders, acting together, may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nSubstantial future sales of shares by existing stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders, particularly our directors, executive officers and the holders of more than 5% of our common stock, or their affiliates or associates, sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or are perceived by the public market as intending to sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. As of March 7, 2017, we had 14,977,397 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 11,296,884 shares were held by directors, officers and stockholders who hold greater than 5% of our common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for a company\u2019s common stocks often is based in part on the research and reports that securities and industry analysts publish about the company. We are not currently aware of any well-known analysts that are covering our common stock, and without analyst coverage it could be hard to generate interest in investments in our common stock. Furthermore, if analyst coverage does develop, and an analyst downgrades our stock or publishes unfavorable research about our business, or if our clinical trials or operating results fail to meet the analysts\u2019 expectations, our stock price would likely decline.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock, and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on an investment in our common stock will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which you purchased it.\nAs a public company, our stock price has been volatile, and securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility of their stock price. Any such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has sometimes been instituted against these companies. For example, in December 2015, several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us, all of which were settled prior to our emergence from bankruptcy. Additional litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\ndo not provide stockholders with the ability to cumulate their votes; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nWe are an emerging growth company and the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards and reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We plan to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we also intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved, exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis). If we do, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies.\nInvestors could find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions, which may make it more difficult for investors to compare our business with other companies in our industry. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. If we are unable to do so, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter, (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or (iv) December 31, 2018, the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act.", "PERMNO": 13755, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HGEN"}
