{"cik": "1469134", "company": "First Community Financial Partners, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nVarious risks and uncertainties, some of which are difficult to predict and beyond First Community\u2019s control, could negatively impact First Community or the Bank. As financial institutions, First Community and the Bank are exposed to interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, risks from economic or market conditions, and general business risks among others. Adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the financial condition and results of operations of First Community or the Bank, as well as the value of First Community common stock.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, FDIC funds, customers and the banking system as a whole, rather than stockholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the Federal Reserve. The Bank, as an Illinois-chartered bank, is subject to regulation and supervision by both the IDFPR and the FDIC. We and the Bank undergo periodic examinations by these regulators, which have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies.\nThe primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect us are described in Item 1. Business under the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. For example, on July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, which significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act, together with the regulations to be developed thereunder, includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that will affect how community banks will be regulated in the future. In addition, the Federal Reserve has adopted numerous new regulations addressing banks\u2019 overdraft and mortgage lending practices. Further, the CFPB was recently established, with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws, and additional consumer protection legislation and regulatory activity is anticipated in the near future.\nIn July 2013, the U.S. federal banking authorities approved the implementation of the Basel III Rule. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital requirements as well as to bank and saving and loan holding companies, other than \u201csmall bank holding companies\u201d (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1 billion). The Basel III Rule not only increases most of the required minimum regulatory capital ratios, it introduces a new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio and the concept of a capital conservation buffer. The Basel III Rule also expands the current definition of capital by establishing additional criteria that capital instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (i.e., Tier 1 Capital in addition to Common Equity) and Tier 2 Capital. A number of instruments that now generally qualify as Tier 1 Capital will not qualify, or their qualifications will change when the Basel III Rule is fully implemented. However, the Basel III Rule permits banking organizations with less than $15 billion in assets to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Basel III Rule has maintained the general structure of the current prompt corrective action thresholds while incorporating the increased requirements, including the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. In order to be a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d depository institution under the new regime, an institution must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.5% or more; a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 8% or more; a Total Capital ratio of 10.0% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or more. Institutions must also maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to avoid certain restrictions on dividends and compensation. Generally, financial institutions became subject to the Basel III Rule on January 1, 2015 with a phase-in period through 2019 for many of the changes.\nSuch changes, including changes regarding interpretations and implementation, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties, and/or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve also have a significant impact on us. Among other things, the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits, and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition from financial institutions and other financial services providers may adversely affect our growth and profitability and have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and experience intense competition from other financial institutions in our market. We compete with these institutions in making loans, attracting deposits and recruiting and retaining talented people. We also compete with non-bank financial service providers, including mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds and credit unions. Many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions that we are and may be able to compete more effectively as a result. We have observed that the competition in our market for making commercial loans has resulted in more competitive pricing and credit structure, as well as intense competition for qualified commercial lending officers. We also may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size, limited branch network, narrower product offerings and lack of geographic diversification as compared to some of our larger competitors. Although our competitive strategy is to provide a distinctly superior customer and employee experience, this strategy could be unsuccessful. Our growth and profitability depend on our continued ability to compete effectively within our market area and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is subject to the conditions of the local economy in which we operate and weakness in the local economy and the real estate markets may materially and adversely affect us.\nOur success is dependent to a large extent upon the general economic conditions in the Illinois and Chicago area where the Bank provides banking and financial services. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in Chicago have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources.\nWhile economic conditions have generally improved since the recession, weakness in the Illinois and Chicago area economy has had and may continue to have a material adverse affect on us, including higher provisions for loan losses and net loan charge-offs, lower net interest income caused by an increase in nonaccrual loans, and higher legal and collection costs. In addition, we may be required to continue to devote substantial additional attention and resources to nonperforming asset management rather than focusing on business growth activities. Adverse conditions in the local economy could also reduce demand for new loans and other financial services and impair our ability to attract and retain deposits.\nOur business is subject to economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and could materially and adversely affect us.\nFrom December 2007 through June 2009, the United States economy was in recession. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the United States was greatly reduced. Although general economic conditions have improved, certain sectors remain weak, including within the Chicago area, where most of our customers are located. In addition, local governments and many businesses continue to experience difficulty due to lower consumer spending and decreased liquidity in the credit markets.\nMarket conditions also led to the failure or merger of several prominent financial institutions and numerous regional and community-based financial institutions. These failures, as well as projected future failures, have had a significant negative impact on the capitalization level of the deposit insurance fund of the FDIC, which, in turn, has led to a significant increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by financial institutions.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of customers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services the Company offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, in the state of Illinois generally and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors: economic growth; efficient capital markets; low inflation; low unemployment; high business and investor confidence; and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nWhile economic conditions in the Chicago area, the state of Illinois and the United States have generally improved since the recession, improvement may not continue or occur at a meaningful rate. Such conditions could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and general reporting practices within the financial services industry, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some accounting policies, such as those pertaining to our allowance for loan losses and deferred tax assets and the necessity of any related valuation allowance, require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMaking loans is a substantial part of our business, and every loan we make is subject to the risk that it will not be repaid or that any underlying collateral in the case of secured loans will not be sufficient to assure full repayment. Among other things, the risk of non-payment is affected by:\n\u009f\nchanges in economic, market and industry conditions,\n\u009f\nthe credit risks associated with the particular borrower and type of loan,\n\u009f\ncash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed,\n\u009f\nthe duration of the loan, and\n\u009f\nopportunities to identify potential loan repayment issues when remedial action may be most effective.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is an accounting reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which we believe is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes. Deterioration in or stagnation of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans and any underlying collateral, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in our allowance for loan losses.\nIn addition, our federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and, based on judgments that differ from those of our management, may require an increase in our provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. Further, if loan charge-offs in future periods exceed our allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance. Any increases in our allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income, and possibly capital, and may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, including interest rate fluctuations, that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect:\n\u009f\nthe Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits,\n\u009f\nthe fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and\n\u009f\nthe average duration of the Company\u2019s securities portfolio.\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore, earnings and cash flows, could be adversely affected.\nEarnings and cash flows could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies, to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Company\u2019s results of operations, if these strategies prove ineffective, or if any substantial, unexpected and prolonged change in market interest rates occurs, such events could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have counterparty risk and therefore we may be materially and adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be materially and negatively affected by the actions and the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are generally interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, credit or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and regularly engage in transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions may expose us to credit or other risks if another financial institution experiences adverse circumstances. In certain circumstances, the collateral that we hold may be insufficient to fully cover the risk that a counterparty defaults on its obligations, which may cause us to experience losses that could have a material adverse affect on us.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. First Community\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. Employee fraud, errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to civil claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and procedures designed to reduce the risk of loss from employee or customer fraud or misconduct, employee errors and operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data.\nWe rely on software developed by third party vendors to process various Company transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on behalf of the Company. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, loan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio management. While the Company performs a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendor over these programs in accordance with industry standards and performs its own testing of user controls, we must rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third party vendors, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, the Company maintains, or contracts with third parties to maintain, backups of key processing output daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, we may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct our business or process our transactions, or incur damage to our reputation if the third party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such disruption or a breach of security may have a material adverse effect on us.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security, including with respect to our Internet banking activities, could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use in our operations and Internet banking activities could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Computer break-ins, \u201cphishing\u201d and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as that of our customers engaging in Internet banking activities. In addition, advances in computer capabilities or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of our systems designed to protect customer data.\nThese risks have increased for all financial institutions as new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as customer-facing web sites.\nThe Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company\u2019s customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and its processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that the Company does not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact the Company through no fault of its own, and in some cases it may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of payment cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, the Company\u2019s reputation could be affected, would could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we have procedures in place to prevent or limit the effects of any of these potential problems and intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to mitigate the risk of such occurrences, these measures could be unsuccessful. Any interruption in, or breach in security of, our computer systems and network infrastructure, or that of our Internet banking customers, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to lending concentration risks.\nAs of December 31, 2014, 78.95% of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans, of which approximately 51.35% were commercial real estate loans. Our commercial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and, therefore, have the potential for higher losses on an individual loan basis. Credit quality issues on larger commercial loans, if they were to occur, could cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures, such as total impaired or non-performing loans, and the amount of charge-offs and recoveries between periods. The deterioration of any one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in uncollectible loans, which would have a material adverse impact on us. In such case, we may not be able to realize the amount of security that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or capital levels.\nWe may not be able to access sufficient and cost-effective sources of liquidity.\nLiquidity is essential to our business and drives our ability to make new loans or invest in securities. In addition, the Company requires liquidity to meet its deposit and debt obligations as they come due. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or the economy generally. Factors that could reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the Chicago area market, difficult credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against us.\nAs part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to what is provided by in-market deposit and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. Although we have recently increased our funding from our core customers to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding, we continue to use brokered money market accounts and certificates of deposits, out-of-local-market certificates of deposit, broker/dealer repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank advances as a source of liquidity.\nOur liquidity position is affected by the amount of cash and other liquid assets on hand, payment of interest and dividends on our outstanding debt and equity instruments, capital we inject into the Bank, redemption of our previously issued debt, proceeds we raise through the issuance of debt and equity instruments, and dividends received from the Bank. Our future liquidity position may be materially adversely affected if, in the future, one or a combination of the following events occur:\n\u009f\nthe Bank reports net losses or its earnings are weak relative to our cash flow needs as a holding company,\n\u009f\nwe deem it advisable or are required by our regulators to use cash at the holding company level to support loan growth of the Bank or address other capital needs of the Bank through downstream capital injections, or\n\u009f\nwe have difficulty raising cash at the holding company level through the issuance of debt or equity securities or accessing additional sources of credit.\nOur usual liquidity management challenges include responding to potential volatility in our customers\u2019 deposit balances. We primarily use advances from the FHLB, broker/dealer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased to meet our immediate liquidity needs. We maintain stable client deposits, which allows us to not heavily rely on wholesale funding sources. However, our client deposits may not remain at current levels and we may not be able to maintain the recent reduced reliance on wholesale deposits. Increased customer confidence in general economic conditions, higher expected rates of return on other investments (including a rise in interest rates) or additional restrictions on the availability of FDIC coverage could each cause our customers to move all or a portion of their deposits to other investment options, thus causing a reduction in our deposits and increasing our reliance on wholesale or other funding sources.\nGiven the losses recorded by our legacy bank subsidiaries and affiliates from 2008 through 2011, the negative retained earnings at the Bank as of December 31, 2014, and the resulting limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to First Community, we have been dependent upon our current cash position and cash proceeds generated by capital raises to meet liquidity needs at the holding company level. If we foresee that we face diminished liquidity, we may, to the extent possible, seek to issue additional debt or securities which could cause ownership or economic dilution to our current shareholders.\nThe repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on business demand deposits could increase the Company\u2019s interest expense and have a material adverse effect on us.\nAll federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on business demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, some financial institutions have commenced offering interest on these demand deposits to compete for customers. If competitive pressures require the Company to pay interest on these demand deposits to attract and retain business customers, its interest expense would increase and its net interest margin would decrease. This could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, the effect of the repeal of the prohibition could be more significant in a higher interest rate environment as business customers would have a greater incentive to seek interest on demand deposits.\nChanges in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs or make it more difficult for us to obtain funding or capital on commercially acceptable terms.\nWe are rated by several different rating agencies, including International Data Corporation and Bankrate.com. Many factors, both within and out of our control, may cause these agencies to downgrade their ratings related to the Company, which could subject us to negative publicity, adversely impact our ability to acquire or retain deposits and increase our cost of borrowing or limit our asset growth. Also, our credit ratings are an important factor to the institutions that provide our sources of liquidity, and reductions in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger unfavorable contractual obligations.\nThe Company is a bank holding company and its sources of funds are limited.\nThe Company is a bank holding company, and its operations are primarily conducted by the Bank, which is subject to significant federal and state regulation. The Company\u2019s ability to receive dividends or loans from the Bank is restricted and therefore the ability to pay dividends to shareholders is restricted. Currently the Bank is unable to pay dividends due to negative retained earnings. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Company in the future will require generation of future earnings by the Bank and could require regulatory approval if any proposed dividends are in excess of prescribed guidelines. Further, as a structural matter, the Company\u2019s right to participate in the assets of the Bank in the event of a liquidation or reorganization of the Bank would be subject to the claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors, including depositors, which would take priority except to the extent the Company may be a creditor with a recognized claim. As of December 31, 2014, the Bank had deposits and other liabilities of approximately $832.0 million.\nOur business strategy is dependent on our continued ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified and experienced personnel in senior management and customer relationship positions.\nWe believe our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced personnel in key senior management and other positions. Our competitive strategy is to provide each of our commercial customers with a highly qualified relationship manager that will serve as the customer\u2019s key point of contact with us. Achieving the status of a \u201ctrusted advisor\u201d for our customers also requires that we minimize relationship manager turnover and provide stability to our customer relationships. Competition for experienced personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel.\nOur reputation could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to us from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate\ngovernance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, ethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators, ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to certain additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we will consider and may enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services. These activities can involve a number of uncertainties, risks and expenses, including the investment of significant time and resources, and our projected price and profitability targets may not be attainable or our efforts may not be successful. These initiatives have required and will continue to require us to enter geographical markets that are new to us. In addition, new lines of business and new products and services could significantly impact the effectiveness of our system of internal controls, and present requirements for legal compliance with which we were previously unfamiliar. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse affect on us.\nWe may experience difficulties in managing our future growth.\nOur future success, in part, depends on our achieving growth in commercial banking relationships that results in increased commercial loans at yields that are profitable to us. Achieving our growth targets requires us to attract customers who currently bank at other financial institutions in our market, thereby increasing our share of the market. Although we believe that we have the necessary resources in place to successfully manage our future growth, our growth strategy exposes us to certain risks and expenses, including adversely affecting our results of operations and placing a significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. In addition, maintaining credit quality while growing our loan portfolio is critical to achieving and sustaining profitable growth. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively. If we fail to do so, we would be materially harmed.\nIn furtherance of our growth strategy, we may also seek to further reorganize our corporate structure or acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future, and we may engage in banking center expansion. In connection with future reorganizations or acquisitions, we may issue equity securities which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders. Moreover, our regulators will need to formally approve our implementation of a reorganization or acquisition strategy. Furthermore, following any future reorganization merger or acquisition, our integration efforts may not be successful or, after giving effect to the acquisition, we may not achieve a level of profitability that will justify the investment that we made in any such acquisition.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to changes in federal and state tax laws and changes in interpretation of existing laws.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is impacted by federal and state tax laws. Given the current economic and political environment, and ongoing federal and state budgetary pressures, the enactment of new federal or state tax legislation may occur. For example, in January 2011, the State of Illinois passed an income tax increase for both individuals and corporations, which increased our state income tax rate. The further enactment of such legislation, or changes in the interpretation of existing law, including provisions impacting tax rates, apportionment, consolidation or combination, income, expenses, and credits, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nRegulatory requirements, growth plans or operating results may require us to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. At December 31, 2014, the Bank was categorized as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the applicable regulatory capital framework. To the extent regulatory requirements change, our future operating results erode capital or we seek to expand through loan growth or acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise capital in any such event would depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, our ability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms is uncertain. The inability to attract new capital investment, or to attract capital on terms acceptable to us, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe have not paid a dividend on our common stock since the Company\u2019s formation in 2006. In addition, regulatory restrictions and liquidity constraints at the holding company level could impair our ability to make distributions on our outstanding securities.\nHistorically, our primary source of funds at the holding company level has been debt and equity issuances. The Bank and its predecessor banks have not paid dividends to the Company, and the Company has not paid dividends to our common shareholders, since the Company\u2019s formation in 2006. Current and future liquidity constraints at the holding company level could continue to impair our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock or pay interest on our outstanding debt securities in the future. If we are unable to pay dividends or interest on our outstanding securities in the future, the market value of such securities may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. In addition, our election not to opt out of JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may make our financial statements less easily comparable to the financial statements of other companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700 million). We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nThe utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nOur net deferred tax asset totaled $14.2 million as of December 31, 2014. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to the expiration of the related net operating losses and the limitations of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 382 contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. Under the rules, such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock within a rolling three-year period, as calculated in accordance with the rules. The rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of the company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company. If we undergo an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 as a result of future transactions involving our common stock, our ability to use any of our net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards or net unrealized built-in losses at the time of ownership change would be subject to the limitations of Section 382 on their use against future taxable income. The limitation may affect the amount of our deferred income tax asset and, depending on the limitation, a portion of our built-in losses, any net operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them. This could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could restrict our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $29.1 million of subordinated debt outstanding. We currently expect our interest expense to be approximately $2.4 million in fiscal year 2015. We may not generate sufficient revenues to service or repay our\ndebt, and have sufficient funds left over to achieve or sustain profitability in our operations, meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to pay dividends to our common shareholders.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences for our shareholders, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy its debt and other obligations;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds, or to sell assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u009f\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u009f\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u009f\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u009f\nchanges in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u009f\ndowngrades in any securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u009f\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u009f\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u009f\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, shareholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business or results of operations.\nOur stock is relatively thinly traded.\nAlthough our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB marketplace, the average daily trading volume of our common stock is relatively small compared to many public companies. The desired market characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness require the substantial presence of willing buyers and sellers in the marketplace at any given time. In our case, this presence depends on the individual decisions of a relatively small number of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Due to the relatively small trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the stock price to fall more than would be justified by the inherent worth of the Company. Conversely, attempts to purchase a significant amount of our stock could cause the market price to rise above the reasonable inherent worth of the Company.", "PERMNO": 15514, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCFP"}
