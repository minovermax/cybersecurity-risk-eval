Risk Factors.\nCertain Business Risks\nAlthough it is not possible to identify all of the risks we encounter, we have identified the following significant risk factors that could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from any such results that might be projected, forecasted, or estimated by us in this report.\nMarket Risks\nThe demand and prices for our products and services are affected by several factors, including the supply, demand, and prices for oil and natural gas.\nDemand for our products and services is materially dependent on the supply, demand, and prices for oil, natural gas, and competing energy sources, and is more specifically dependent on the supply, demand, and prices for the products and services we offer, both in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we operate. These factors are also influenced by the U.S., foreign, and regional economic, financial, business, political, and social conditions within the markets we serve. Oil and gas prices and, therefore, the levels of well drilling, completion, workover, and production activities, tend to fluctuate and have declined significantly since 2014. Worldwide economic and political events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and increasing or decreasing demand in other large world economies as well as tremendous growth in natural gas supplies in the U.S. from shale reserves, have contributed to, and are likely to continue to contribute to, price volatility. The expansion of alternative energy supplies that compete with oil and gas, improvements in energy conservation, and improvements in the energy efficiency of vehicles, plants, equipment, and devices will also reduce oil and gas consumption or slow its growth.\nCrude oil prices have significantly declined since 2014. Although crude oil prices were volatile in 2015, with West Texas Intermediate oil prices ranging from a high of $59.80 per barrel in June 2015 to a low of $37.24 per barrel in December 2015, prices have steadily declined from a high of $107.50 in June 2014. U.S. natural gas prices also decreased in 2015, with Henry Hub prices ranging from a high of $2.97 per million British thermal units (\u201cMMBtu\u201d) in January 2015 to a low of $1.92 per MMBtu in December 2015, down from a high of $6.49 per MMBtu in February 2014. Oil and gas prices have declined further during early 2016. Low oil and natural gas prices have negatively affected the operating cash flows and exploration and development activities and plans of many of our customers and have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative impact on the demand for many of our products and services.\nIf economic conditions or energy prices remain depressed or further deteriorate, there are likely to be additional constraints on oil and gas industry spending levels. Reduced spending levels would negatively impact the demand for many of our products and services and the prices we charge for these products and services, which would negatively affect our revenues and future growth.\nDuring this current period of low oil and natural gas prices, many of our customers are experiencing a downturn in their financial condition. Current economic conditions may also lead to additional constraints on the operating cash flows of our customers, potentially impacting their ability to pay us in a timely manner, which could result in increased customer bankruptcies and uncollectible receivables.\nWe encounter, and expect to continue to encounter, intense competition in the sale of our products and services.\nWe compete with numerous companies in each of our operating segments, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. Certain of our competitors have lower standards of quality and older equipment and safety, and offer services at lower prices than we do. Other competitors have newer equipment that is better suited to our customers' needs. Particularly during the current period of low oil and natural gas pricing, to the extent competitors offer products or services at lower prices or higher quality, or more cost-effective products or services, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, certain of our customers may elect to perform services internally in lieu of using our services, which could also materially and adversely affect our operations.\nThe profitability of our operations is dependent on other numerous factors beyond our control.\nOur operating results in general, and gross profit in particular, are determined by market conditions and the products and services we sell in any period. Other factors, such as heightened competition, changes in sales and distribution channels, availability of skilled labor and contract services, shortages in raw materials, or inability to obtain supplies at reasonable prices, may also affect the cost of sales and the fluctuation of gross margin in future periods.\nOther factors affecting our operating results and activity levels include oil and natural gas industry spending levels for exploration and production, development, and acquisition activities, impairments of long-lived assets, and plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning costs on Maritech\u2019s remaining offshore production platforms, wells, and pipelines. Several of our customers have reduced their capital expenditures in 2015 and have publicly announced further reductions in their capital expenditure plans for 2016 in light of the significant declines in the prices of oil and natural gas, and such reductions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative effect on the demand for many of our products and services. This has had, and is expected to continue to have, a negative effect on our revenues and results of operations. A large concentration of our operating activities is located in the onshore and offshore U.S. Gulf Coast region. Our revenues and profitability are particularly dependent upon oil and natural gas industry activity and spending levels in this region. Our operations may also be affected by technological advances, cost of capital, and tax policies. Adverse changes in any of these other factors may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nChanges in the economic environment have resulted, and could further result, in further significant impairments of certain of our long-lived assets and goodwill.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily as a result of the significant decreases in oil and natural gas prices, we recorded certain consolidated long-lived asset impairments (excluding goodwill impairments) of approximately $44.2 million. During the two year period ending December 31, 2015, we have recorded a total of\n$79.0 million of long-lived asset impairments. A continuation of the depressed commodity prices and/or further changes in the economic environment could result in a greater decrease in the demand for many of our products and services, which could impact the expected utilization rates of certain of our long-lived assets, including plant facilities, operating locations, barges and vessels, and other operating equipment. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we review the carrying value of our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, based on their expected future cash flows. The impact of reduced expected future cash flow could require the write-down of all or a portion of the carrying value for these assets, which would result in additional impairments, resulting in decreased earnings.\nDue to decreases in our stock price and CCLP's common unit price and the expected future cash flows from certain of our reporting units, we recorded approximately $177.0 million of goodwill impairments during the fourth quarter of 2015. During the two year period ending December 31, 2015, we have recorded a total of approximately $241.3 million of goodwill impairments. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we review the carrying value of our goodwill for possible impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Changes in circumstances indicating the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or the price of CCLP's common units, or future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. If economic and market conditions decline further, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, and as of March 3, 2016, the prices of our common stock and the common units of CCLP have continued to decline, and as a result future additional impairments are possible.\nThe demand for our products and services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could continue to be adversely impacted by increased regulation and continuing regulatory uncertainty.\nOperations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been subject to an increasingly stringent regulatory environment including government regulations focused on offshore operating requirements, spill cleanup, and enforcement matters. These regulations also implement additional safety and certification requirements applicable to offshore activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Demand for our products and services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico continues to be affected by these regulations. Future regulatory requirements could delay our customers\u2019 activities, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs, including the cost to insure offshore operations, resulting in reduced cash flows and profitability.\nWe are dependent on third-party suppliers for specific products and equipment necessary to provide certain of our products and services.\nWe sell a variety of clear brine fluids to the oil and gas industry and non-energy markets, including calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, sodium bromide, and formate-based brines, some of which we manufacture and some of which are purchased from third parties. Sales of these compound products contribute significantly to our revenues. In our manufacture of calcium chloride, we use brines, hydrochloric acid, and other raw materials purchased from third parties. In our manufacture of bromide compound products, we use elemental bromine, hydrobromic acid, and other raw materials which are purchased from third parties. We rely on Chemtura Corporation as a supplier of raw materials for our bromide compound products as well as for our El Dorado, Arkansas, calcium chloride plant. Although we have long-term supply agreements with Chemtura, if we were unable to acquire these raw materials at reasonable prices for a prolonged period, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nSome of the well plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning services performed by our Offshore Services segment require the use of vessels, diving, cutting, and other equipment and services provided by third parties. We lease equipment and obtain services from certain providers, and there can be no assurance that this equipment and these services will be available at reasonable prices in the future.\nThe fabrication of our compression packages, pump systems, and production testing, well monitoring, and rig cooling equipment requires the purchase of many types of components, some of which we obtain from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers exposes us to the risk of price increases, inferior component quality, or an inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner. The profitability or future growth of our Compression and Production Testing Divisions may be adversely affected due to our dependence on these key suppliers.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace, and the continued ability to attract new employees.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain skilled management and employees at reasonable compensation levels. The delivery of our products and services requires personnel with specialized skills and experience. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled managers and workers in the U.S. Gulf Coast region and other regions in which we operate is high and the supply is limited. A lack of qualified personnel, could adversely affect operating results.\nOperating, Technological, and Strategic Risks\nWe may not fully realize the benefits from the CSI Acquisition.\nAs a result of the significant decline in oil and gas prices since the CSI Acquisition, we do not expect to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the CSI Acquisition. In addition, a portion of the expected benefits may not be realized if we are unable to fully and efficiently integrate the business and operations of CSI. While significant steps to integrate and consolidate operations functions have been accomplished, the integration of certain administrative functions has yet to be completed. We are currently reviewing the steps necessary to convert and consolidate CSI's financial accounting, operating, and information systems environment into our system environment. There can be no assurances that these system integration efforts will accomplish all the targeted efficiencies, or that they will not be more costly or take longer to accomplish than what we currently estimate.\nWe performed an inspection of the assets to be acquired, which we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. However, the accuracy of our assessments of the assets and our estimates are inherently uncertain. There could also be environmental or other problems that are not necessarily observable even when the inspection is undertaken. If problems are identified after closing of the CSI Acquisition, the stock purchase agreement provides for limited recourse against the seller. In addition, our estimate of the required working capital for the CSI business and targeted working capital set forth in the stock purchase agreement may not be sufficient for actual working capital needs of the CSI business. If our estimate and the targeted working capital were lower than the actual needs of the acquired business, the Compression Division may be required to fund such additional working capital needs out of its operating cash flows or borrowings under the CCLP Credit Agreement.\nThe CSI Acquisition has substantially expanded the scope and size of our Compression Division's business, with larger manufacturing and unit sales and aftermarket service operations. Additionally, CSI\u2019s business includes operations and equipment that we have not historically provided. Consequently, we may not be able to integrate CSI\u2019s operations into our Compression Division's operations or to realize the expected economic benefits of the CSI Acquisition.\nWe have technological and age-obsolescence risk, both with our products and services as well as with our equipment assets.\nNew drilling, completion, and production technologies and equipment are constantly evolving. If we are unable to adapt to new advances in technology or replace older assets with new assets, we are at risk of losing customers and market share. In particular, many of our significant equipment assets, including one of our heavy lift barges and certain dive support vessels, are approaching the end of their useful lives, which may adversely affect our ability to serve certain customers. Other equipment, such as a portion of our production testing equipment fleet, may be inadequate to meet the needs of our customers in certain markets. The permanent replacement or upgrade of any of our vessels or equipment will require significant capital. Due to the unique nature of many of these assets, finding a suitable or acceptable replacement may be difficult and/or cost prohibitive. The replacement or enhancement of these assets over the next several years may be necessary in order for us to effectively compete in the current marketplace.\nWe face risks related to our long-term growth strategy.\nOur long-term growth strategy includes both internal growth and growth through acquisitions. Internal growth may require significant capital expenditures, some of which may become unrecoverable or fail to generate an acceptable level of cash flows. Internal growth also requires financial resources (including the use of available cash or additional long-term debt), management, and personnel resources. Acquisitions also require significant\nmanagement resources, both at the time of the transaction and during the process of integrating the newly acquired business into our operations. If we overextend our current financial resources by growing too aggressively, we could face liquidity problems or have difficulty obtaining additional financing. Acquisitions could adversely affect our operations if we are unable to successfully integrate the newly acquired companies into our operations, are unable to hire adequate personnel, or are unable to retain existing personnel. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms. Acquisition or internal growth assumptions developed to support our decisions could prove to be overly optimistic. Future acquisitions by us could result in issuances of equity securities or the rights associated with the equity securities, which could potentially dilute earnings per share. Future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. These factors could adversely affect our future operating results and financial position.\nOur operations involve significant operating risks and insurance coverage may not be available or cost-effective.\nWe are subject to operating hazards normally associated with the oilfield service industry, including automobile accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts, formation collapse, mechanical problems, abnormally pressured formations, and environmental accidents. Environmental accidents could include, but are not limited to oil spills, gas leaks or ruptures, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, or well fluids, or discharges of CBFs or toxic gases or other pollutants. These operating hazards may also include injuries to employees and third parties during the performance of our operations. Our operation of marine barges and vessels, heavy equipment, offshore production platforms, chemical manufacturing plants, and the performance of heavy lift and diving services involve particularly high levels of risk. In addition, certain of our employees who perform services on offshore platforms and vessels are covered by the provisions of the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, and general maritime law. These laws make the liability limits established by state workers\u2019 compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and, instead, permit our affected employees or their representatives to pursue actions against us for damages for job-related injuries. Whenever possible, we obtain agreements from customers and suppliers that limit our exposure. However, the occurrence of certain operating hazards, including storms, could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations.\nWe have maintained a policy of insuring our risks of operational hazards that we believe is typical in the industry. We believe that the limits of insurance coverage we have purchased are consistent with the exposures we face and the nature of our products and services. Due to economic conditions in the insurance industry, from time to time, we have increased our self-insured retentions for certain policies in order to minimize the increased costs of coverage, or we have reduced our limits of insurance coverage for, or not procured, named windstorm coverage. In certain areas of our business, we, from time to time, have elected to assume the risk of loss for specific assets. Due to the sale of substantially all of Maritech's oil and gas properties, typical operational risk coverage for its remaining properties, such as removal of debris, operators extra expense, control of well, and pollution and cleanup coverage, is not available at economical rates. To the extent we suffer losses or claims that are not covered, or are only partially covered by insurance, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could incur losses on fixed price contracts.\nDue to competitive market conditions, a portion of our well abandonment and decommissioning projects may be performed on a lump sum basis. Pursuant to these types of contracts, defined work is delivered for a fixed price, and extra work, which is subject to customer approval, is charged separately. The revenue, cost, and gross profit realized on these types of contracts can vary from the estimated amount because of changes in offshore conditions, increases in the scope of the work to be performed, increased site clearance efforts required, labor and equipment availability, cost and productivity levels, and the performance level of other contractors. In addition, unanticipated events, such as accidents, work delays, significant changes in the condition of platforms or wells, downhole problems, weather, and environmental or other technical issues, could result in significant losses on these types of projects. These variations and risks may result in our experiencing reduced profitability or losses on these types of projects.\nThe valuation of decommissioning liabilities is based on estimated data that may be materially incorrect.\nOur estimates of future well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities are imprecise and are subject to change due to: (i) changes in the forecasts of the supply, demand, cost and timing of well abandonment and decommissioning services; (ii) additional remediation work required on previously completed well abandonment\nprojects; (iii) damage to wells and infrastructure caused by hurricanes and other natural events; (iv) changes in governmental regulations governing well abandonment and decommissioning work; and (v) other factors. In particular, a portion of the remaining decommissioning liabilities for our Maritech subsidiary relates to an offshore production platform that was toppled and destroyed by a hurricane and the estimate to perform the remaining decommissioning and debris removal work on this property is particularly imprecise due to the unique nature of the work to be performed. During the three year period ended December 31, 2015, Maritech increased its combined decommissioning liability by a total of approximately $152.7 million, consisting of $73.4 million of revisions to its existing liabilities as well as $79.3 million from adding new liabilities for remediation work required on projects previously thought to have been completed.\nAs noted above, Maritech has encountered situations where previously plugged and abandoned wells on its properties have later exhibited a buildup of pressure that is evidenced by gas bubbles coming from the plugged well head. We refer to this situation as \u201cwells under pressure\u201d, and this can either be discovered by us when we perform additional work at the property or by notification from a third party. Wells under pressure require Maritech to return to the site to perform additional plug and abandonment procedures that were not originally anticipated or included in the estimate of the asset retirement obligation for such property. Remediation work at previously abandoned well sites is particularly costly due to the lack of a platform from which to base these activities. During 2014, Maritech added new decommissioning liabilities of approximately $39.2 million for work performed during the year or related to the estimated cost of future work to be performed on previously plugged and abandoned wells. This additional amount was directly charged to earnings as an operating expense during 2014. Maritech is the last operator of record for its plugged wells and bears the risk of additional future work required as a result of wells becoming under pressure in the future.\nWeather-Related Risks\nCertain of our operations are seasonal and depend, in part, on weather conditions.\nThe Offshore Division's Offshore Services segment has historically enjoyed its highest vessel utilization rates during the period from April to October, when weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico are typically more favorable for offshore activities, and has experienced its lowest utilization rates in the period from November to March. Under certain lump sum and other contracts, this segment may bear the risk of delays caused by adverse weather conditions. In addition, demand for other products and services we provide are subject to seasonal fluctuations, due in part to weather conditions that cannot be predicted. Accordingly, our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter, depending on weather conditions in applicable areas.\nIn certain markets, the Fluids Division\u2019s onshore water management services can be dependent on adequate water supplies being available to its customers. To the extent severe drought or other weather-related conditions prevent our customers from obtaining needed water, frac water operations may not be possible and our Fluids Division business may be negatively affected.\nSevere weather, including named windstorms, can cause significant damage and disruption to our businesses.\nA significant portion of our operations is susceptible to adverse weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico, including hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions. High winds, storm surge, and turbulent seas can cause significant damage and curtail our operations for extended periods during and after such weather conditions, while damage is being assessed and remediated. Even if we do not experience direct damage from storms, we may experience disruptions in our operations, because we are unable to operate or our customers or suppliers may curtail their activities due to damage to their wells, platforms, pipelines, and facilities. From time to time, our onshore operations are also negatively affected by adverse weather conditions, including sustained rain and flooding.\nA portion of the costs resulting from damages from previous hurricanes has yet to be incurred and may result in significant charges to earnings.\nDuring the past four years, Maritech has performed an extensive amount of well intervention, abandonment, decommissioning, debris removal, and platform construction associated with its offshore platforms that were destroyed by hurricanes. As of December 31, 2015, Maritech has remaining hurricane damage response work associated with one of the downed platforms, and the estimated cost to perform this remaining abandonment,\ndecommissioning, and debris removal work is approximately $7.8 million net to our interest. Due to the unique nature of the remaining work to be performed, actual costs could greatly exceed these estimates and, depending on the nature of any excess costs incurred, could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods. All of this $7.8 million estimated amount has been accrued as part of Maritech\u2019s decommissioning liabilities. Our estimates of the remaining costs to be incurred may be imprecise.\nFor a further discussion of the remaining costs resulting from damages from the 2005 and 2008 hurricanes, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cNote B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Repair Costs and Insurance Recoveries.\u201d\nWe have elected to self-insure windstorm damage to our remaining Maritech assets in the Gulf of Mexico, and hurricane damages could result in significant uninsured losses.\nDespite the sales of substantially all of Maritech\u2019s oil and gas reserves during 2011 and 2012, and expending approximately $187.7 million of decommissioning work during the three year period ended December 31, 2015, we have remaining decommissioning liabilities of approximately $48.4 million associated with offshore platforms and associated wells to be decommissioned and abandoned. We have discontinued insurance coverage for windstorm damage and have elected to self-insure these risks. To the extent that remaining offshore platforms and associated wells are not decommissioned and abandoned prior to a windstorm occurring, Maritech would be exposed to losses from windstorm damages and storms in the future. Depending on the severity and location of the storms, such losses could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation, and cash flows.\nFinancial Risks\nDeterioration of our financial ratios could result in covenant defaults under our long-term debt agreements and result in decreased credit availability.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total debt outstanding of approximately $293.0 million consisted of approximately $22.9 million under our bank revolving credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and approximately $270.1 million carrying amount of our Senior Notes and Senior Secured Notes. In addition, our consolidated balance sheet includes approximately $580.5 million of long-term debt of CCLP (consisting of approximately $235.0 million under the CCLP Credit Agreement and approximately $345.5 million carrying amount under the CCLP Senior Notes). Additional growth could result in increased debt levels to support our or CCLP's capital expenditure needs or acquisition activities. Debt service costs related to outstanding long-term debt represent a significant use of our operating cash flow and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThese long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants and other restrictions and requirements. In addition, the agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including a minimum interest charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, both of which are defined in our Credit Agreement and in the note purchase agreements relating to our Senior Notes and Senior Secured Notes. Deterioration of these ratios could result in a default under the agreements. Although these agreements include cross-default provisions relating to other of our indebtedness that is greater than a defined amount, we have no cross default provisions, cross collateralization provisions, or cross guarantees with CCLP's debt, nor does CCLP with our debt. If any such indebtedness is not paid or is accelerated and such event is not remedied in a timely manner, a default will occur under our long-term debt agreements. Any event of default, if not timely remedied, could result in a termination of all commitments of the lenders and an acceleration of any outstanding loans and credit obligations.\nAccess to our revolving credit line is dependent upon our compliance with the financial ratio covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement. These financial ratios include a minimum interest charge coverage ratio (ratio of a defined measure of earnings to interest) of 3.0 and a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of debt and letters of credit outstanding to a defined measure of earnings) of 3.25. The maximum leverage ratio decreases to 3.0 as of March 31, 2016. Consolidated net earnings under the credit facility is the aggregate of our net income (or loss) and the net income (or loss) of our consolidated restricted subsidiaries, including cash dividends and distributions (not the return of capital) received from persons other than consolidated restricted subsidiaries (such as distributions from CCLP) and after allowances for taxes for such period determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), excluding certain items more specifically described therein. This definition of consolidated net earnings excludes an amount of extraordinary and nonrecurring gains and losses\nup to 25% of a measure of earnings. In addition, the note purchase agreements relating to our Senior Notes include similar financial covenants. Under these note purchase agreements, the financial ratio requirements include a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5. At December 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s leverage ratio was 1.86 to 1.\nOur continuing ability to comply with these financial covenants depends largely upon our ability to generate adequate operating cash flows. Historically, our financial performance has been more than adequate to meet these covenants. Due to the decreased demand for certain of our products and services by our customers in response to decreased oil and natural gas prices, we have taken strategic cost reduction efforts, including headcount reductions, deferral of salary increases, salary reductions, and other efforts to reduce costs and generate cash to mitigate the reduced demand for our products and services. In addition, certain of our businesses have seen increased activity and profitability levels, despite current oil and natural gas prices. Based on our projections for each of the quarterly periods in 2016, and including the impact of these cost reduction efforts and expected activity levels on future estimated operating cash flows, we anticipate that we will have sufficient operating cash flows to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under our long-term debt agreements through December 31, 2016.\nCCLP's continuing ability to comply with its financial covenants depends largely upon its ability to generate adequate cash flow. Historically, CCLP's financial performance has been more than adequate to meet these covenants, and CCLP expects this trend to continue. However, as a result of the recent decreased demand for certain of CCLP's products and services by its customers in response to decreased oil and natural gas prices, and CCLP's expectation that the reduced demand will continue for an indefinite period, CCLP has taken strategic cost reduction efforts, including headcount reductions, deferral of salary increases, salary reductions, and other efforts to reduce costs and generate cash. Based on CCLP's projections for each of the quarterly periods in 2016, and including the impact of these cost-reduction efforts to increase operating cash flows, CCLP anticipates that it will be in compliance with the financial covenants and other requirements under the CCLP Credit Agreement and CCLP Senior Notes through December 31, 2016. However, there is a remote possibility that CCLP may fail to be in compliance with its financial covenants going forward, and would consequently be in a condition of default under the CCLP Credit Agreement and CCLP Senior Notes if CCLP fails to obtain a waiver or amendment from its lenders. There can be no assurance that CCLP cost reductions will be successful or that market conditions and operating performance will not be further decreased compared to its projections.\nCCLP's long-term debt levels may limit the amount of cash available to be distributed, which will affect our cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2015, CCLP had approximately $235.0 million outstanding under the CCLP Credit Agreement, $350 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes, and it may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. As of March 3, 2016, the amount outstanding under the CCLP Credit Agreement had increased to approximately $254.0 million. The level of CCLP indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nCCLP's ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for its working capital, capital expenditures (including acquisitions), or other purposes, may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022\ncovenants contained in CCLP's existing and future credit and debt arrangements will require it to meet financial tests that may affect its flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in its business, including possible acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nCCLP's use of a portion of its cash flow to make principal and interest payments on its indebtedness will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for distributions to unitholders, including to us;\n\u2022\nCCLP may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022\nCCLP's flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be affected.\nIncreases in CCLP's indebtedness would increase its total interest expense, which would in turn reduce its forecasted cash available for distribution. CCLP's ability to service its indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. If CCLP's operating results are not sufficient to service its current or future indebtedness, CCLP will be forced to take actions such as further\nreducing distributions, reducing or delaying its business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing its indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. CCLP may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nCCLP continues to review its operating activity levels in the current low commodity price environment and the impact of the current market environment on its anticipated levels of distributable cash flows and quarterly distributions. The amount of distributions we received from CCLP, including those based on the impact of the incentive distribution rights owned by our wholly owned subsidiary, CSI Compressco GP Inc., resulted in an increase in the quarterly distributions we received from CCLP during 2015 compared to the prior year. In January 2016, however, CCLP declared a cash distribution attributable to the quarter ended December 31, 2015, of $0.3775 per unit, which represents a decrease of $0.1250 or 24.9% per unit compared to the previous quarterly distribution. The amount of quarterly distributions is determined based on a variety of factors, including estimates of CCLP's cash needs to fund its future operating, investing, and debt service requirements. During the current period of low oil and natural gas pricing, there can be no assurance that quarterly distributions from CCLP will increase from this reduced amount per unit or that there will not be future decreases in the amount of distributions going forward.\nWe may have continuing exposure to abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with oil and gas properties previously owned by Maritech.\nDuring 2011, in connection with the sale of a significant majority of Maritech\u2019s oil and gas producing properties, the buyers of the properties assumed the associated decommissioning liabilities, which had an estimated value at the time of sale of approximately $122.0 million pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements. For oil and gas properties Maritech previously owned, the buyer of the properties assumed the financial responsibilities associated with the properties' operations, including abandonment and decommissioning, and generally became the successor operator. Some buyers of these Maritech properties subsequently sold certain of these properties to other buyers, who also assumed the financial responsibilities associated with the properties' operations, and these buyers also typically became the successor operator of the properties. To the extent that a buyer of these properties fails to perform the abandonment and decommissioning work required, a previous owner, including Maritech, may be required to perform the abandonment and decommissioning obligation. A significant portion of the decommissioning liabilities that were assumed by the buyers of the Maritech properties in 2011 remains unperformed, and we believe the amounts of these remaining liabilities are significant. We monitor the financial condition of the buyers of these properties from Maritech, and if current oil and natural gas pricing levels continue or deteriorate further, we expect that one or more of these buyers may be unable to perform the decommissioning work required on properties they acquired from Maritech. To the extent Maritech is required to perform a significant portion of the abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with these previously owned oil and gas properties, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, continued low oil and natural gas prices have resulted in reduced revenues and cash flows for all oil and gas producing companies, including those companies that bought Maritech properties in the past. Certain of these oil and gas producing companies that bought Maritech properties are currently experiencing severe financial difficulties. With regard to certain of these properties, Maritech has security in the form of bonds or cash escrows intended to secure the buyers' obligations to perform the decommissioning work. One company that bought, and subsequently sold, Maritech properties filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2015. Maritech estimates that of the total amount of decommissioning liabilities associated with properties sold to this company, Maritech is exposed to a high level of risk on properties that had decommissioning liabilities at the time they were sold in 2011 of approximately $6 million. This amount, which is net to Maritech's interest, may not be representative of the current fair value of these obligations and does not reflect the potential benefit of bonding that may be available to Maritech if it were to be required to perform such obligations. Maritech and its legal counsel monitor the status of these companies. There can be no assurance that Maritech will not become legally responsible to perform decommissioning work on properties it previously sold, resulting in charges to our future earnings and increases to our future operating cash requirements.\nWe are exposed to significant credit risks.\nWe face credit risk associated with the significant amounts of accounts receivable we have with our customers in the energy industry. Many of our customers, particularly those associated with our onshore operations, are small- to medium-sized oil and gas operators that may be more susceptible to declines in oil and gas commodity prices or generally increased operating expenses than larger companies. Our ability to collect from our customers is impacted by the current decreased oil and natural gas price environment.\nAs the owner and operator of its oil and gas property interests, Maritech is liable for the proper abandonment and decommissioning of these properties. We have guaranteed a portion of the abandonment and decommissioning liabilities of Maritech. With respect to certain properties, Maritech is entitled to be paid by the previous owner of the property in the future for all or a portion of the cost of satisfying these obligations when the liability is satisfied. We and Maritech are subject to the risk that the previous owner(s) will be unable to make these future payments. In addition, for certain remaining Maritech properties that have not been decommissioned or abandoned, the co-owners of such properties are responsible for the payment of their portions of the associated operating expenses and abandonment liabilities. However, if one or more co-owners do not pay their portions, Maritech and any other nondefaulting co-owners may be liable for the defaulted amount. If any required payment is not made by a previous owner or a co-owner and any security is not sufficient to cover the required payment, we could suffer losses, which could be material.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, continued decreased oil and natural gas prices have resulted in reduced revenues and cash flows for oil and gas producing companies, including companies that are joint-owners in Maritech oil and gas properties and decommissioning obligations currently owned or from whom Maritech is entitled to receive payments upon satisfaction of certain decommissioning obligations. Certain of these previous owners of Maritech properties who are obligated to pay Maritech in the future are currently experiencing severe financial difficulties, including one company which filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of 2015. The majority of the amounts owed to Maritech by these companies are not contractually required to be paid to Maritech until several years in the future. Nevertheless, we are monitoring the financial condition of this company, and if current oil and natural gas pricing levels continue, this company may be unable to pay Maritech for contractual amounts owed. Maritech intends to take any action necessary to protect Maritech's interests. Although certain of these decommissioning obligations may not be performed for many years, there can be no assurance that the current oil and gas price environment will not result in charges to our future earnings and increases to our future operating cash requirements.\nOur operating results and cash flows for certain of our subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency risk.\nThe operations of certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and certain foreign currencies, particularly the euro, the British pound, the Mexican peso, and the Argentinian peso. Our plans to grow our international operations could cause this exposure from fluctuating currencies to increase. Historically, exchange rates of foreign currencies have fluctuated significantly compared to the U.S. dollar, and this exchange rate volatility is expected to continue. Significant fluctuations in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk with regard to our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we and CCLP have a total of $257.9 million outstanding under our respective revolving credit facilities. These revolving credit facilities consist of floating rate loans that bear interest at an agreed upon percentage rate spread (which is determined on our leverage ratio) above LIBOR. Accordingly, our cash flows and results of operations could be subject to interest rate risk exposure associated with the level of the variable rate debt balance outstanding. We currently are not a party to an interest rate swap contract or other derivative instrument designed to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk.\nOur revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2019. CCLP's revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on October 15, 2019. Our Senior Notes and CCLP's Senior Notes bear interest at fixed interest rates and are scheduled to mature at various dates between December 2017 and November 2022. There can be no assurance that the financial market conditions or borrowing terms at the times these existing debt agreements are renegotiated will be as favorable as the current terms and interest rates.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Political Risks\nOur operations are subject to extensive and evolving U.S. and foreign federal, state and local laws and regulatory requirements that increase our operating costs and expose us to potential fines, penalties, and litigation.\nLaws and regulations govern our operations, including those relating to corporate governance, employees, taxation, fees, importation and exportation restrictions, environmental affairs, health and safety, and the manufacture, storage, handling, transportation, use, and sale of chemical products. Certain foreign countries\nimpose additional restrictions on our activities, such as currency restrictions and restrictions on various labor practices. Our operation and decommissioning of offshore properties are subject to and affected by various government regulations, including numerous federal and state environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex and stringent, and compliance is becoming increasingly expensive. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations, and violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, and injunctions. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance with certain laws and regulations. It is possible that increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.\nThe EPA is studying the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, a process used by the U.S. oil and gas industry in the development of certain oil and gas reservoirs. Specifically, the EPA is reviewing the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. Certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. Several states have adopted regulations that require operators to disclose the chemical constituents in hydraulic fracturing fluids. We cannot predict whether any federal, state or local laws or regulations will be enacted regarding hydraulic fracturing, and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on oil and gas operators through the adoption of new laws and regulations, the domestic demand for certain of our products and services could be decreased or subject to delays, particularly for our Production Testing, Compression, and Fluids Divisions.\nA large portion of the services performed by our Offshore Division's Offshore Services segment and all of Maritech\u2019s remaining well abandonment and decommissioning operations are conducted on offshore federal leases and are governed by increasing U.S. government regulations. Government regulations also establish construction requirements for production facilities located on federal offshore leases and govern the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal of production facilities from these leases. Operators must abide by Idle Iron Guidance regulations that regulate the permanent plugging of nonproducing wells and the dismantling of oil and gas production platforms within a certain period of time after they are no longer being used. BSEE oversees the provisions of the Idle Iron Guidance. Under limited circumstances, the BSEE could require Maritech or our Offshore Services segment to suspend or terminate their operations on a federal lease, and both Maritech and our Offshore Services segment could be subject to fines and penalties.\nWe have significant operations that are either ongoing or scheduled to commence in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At this time, we cannot predict the full impact that other regulatory actions that may be mandated by the federal government may have on our operations or the operations of our customers. Other governmental or regulatory actions could further reduce our revenues and increase our operating costs, including the cost to insure offshore operations, resulting in reduced cash flows and profitability.\nOur onshore and offshore operations expose us to risks such as the potential for harmful substances escaping into the environment and causing damages or injuries, which could be substantial. Although we maintain general liability and pollution liability insurance, these policies are subject to exceptions and coverage limits. We maintain limited environmental liability insurance covering named locations and environmental risks associated with contract services for oil and gas operations. We could be materially and adversely affected by an enforcement proceeding or a claim that is not covered or is only partially covered by insurance.\nBecause our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements that impose additional restrictions on the industry may adversely affect our financial results. Regulators are becoming more focused on air emissions from oil and gas operations, including volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and greenhouse gases. In particular, the focus on greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our financial results if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced economic activity generally. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs, capital spending requirements, or additional operating restrictions for us, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nIn addition to increasing our risk of environmental liability, the rigorous enforcement of environmental laws and regulations has accelerated the growth of some of the markets we serve. Decreased regulation and\nenforcement in the future could materially and adversely affect the demand for certain of the services offered by our Offshore Services operations and, therefore, materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur expansion into foreign countries exposes us to complex regulations and may present us with new obstacles to growth.\nWe plan to continue to grow both in the United States and in foreign countries. We have established operations in, among other countries, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Finland, Ghana, Iraq, Mexico, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Foreign operations carry special risks. Our business in the countries in which we currently operate and those in which we may operate in the future could be limited or disrupted by:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriating cash back to the United States;\n\u2022\nthe impact of compliance with anti-corruption laws on our operations and competitive position in affected countries and the risk that actions taken by us or our agents may violate those laws;\n\u2022\ngovernment controls and government actions, such as expropriation of assets and changes in legal and regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and taxes; and\n\u2022\nour limited knowledge of these markets or our inability to protect our interests.\nWe and our affiliates operate in countries where governmental corruption has been known to exist. While we and our subsidiaries are committed to conducting business in a legal and ethical manner, there is a risk of violating either the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K Bribery Act, or laws or legislation promulgated pursuant to the 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions or other applicable anti-corruption regulations that generally prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. Violation of these laws could result in monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nForeign governments and agencies often establish permit and regulatory standards different from those in the U.S. If we cannot obtain foreign regulatory approvals, or if we cannot obtain them in a timely manner, our growth and profitability from foreign operations could be adversely affected.\nOur growing operations in Argentina expose us to the changing economic, legal, and political environments in that country, including the changing regulations over repatriation of cash generated from our operations in Argentina.\nThe current economic, legal, and political environment in Argentina and recent devaluation of the Argentinian peso have created increased economic instability for foreign investment in Argentina. The Argentinian government is currently attempting to address the current high rate of inflation and the continuing devaluations pressure. Fiscal and monetary expansion in Argentina has led to devaluations of the Argentinian peso, particularly in late 2013, early 2014, and late 2015. Additional currency adjustment may be necessary to help boost the current Argentina economy, but may be accompanied by fiscal and monetary tightening, including additional restrictions on the purchase of U.S. dollars in Argentina.\nAs a result of our expanding operations in Argentina, consolidated revenues and operating cash flow generated in Argentina have increased over the past three years. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $3.5 million of our consolidated cash balance is located in Argentina, and the process of repatriating this cash to the U.S. is subject to increasingly complex regulations. There can be no assurances that our growing Argentinian operations will not expose us to a loss of liquidity, foreign exchange losses, and other potential financial impacts.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt production and cause us to incur costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nThe EPA has determined that \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\"GHGs\") present an endangerment to public health and the environment, because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings allow the EPA to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (\"CAA\"). Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA rules regulate GHG emissions under the CAA and require a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and from certain large stationary sources as well as requiring so-called \u201cgreen\u201d completions at hydraulically fractured natural gas wells beginning in 2015. The EPA also requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including petroleum refineries, as well as from certain oil and gas production facilities.\nThe adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our facilities and operations could require us to incur costs. Further, Congress has considered and almost one-half of the states have adopted legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of GHGs from a wide range of sources. Any such legislation could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce and, in turn, demand for our products and services. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations and cause us to incur costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nOur proprietary rights may be violated or compromised, which could damage our operations.\nWe own numerous patents, patent applications, and unpatented trade secret technologies in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of these rights. In addition, independent third parties may develop competitive or superior technologies.\nOur operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, supply chain, customer invoicing, employee information, and other business processes. We outsource certain business process functions to third-party providers and similarly rely on these third-parties to maintain and store confidential information on their systems. The failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.\nFurthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control, including those involving cyberattacks using viruses, worms or other destructive software, process breakdowns, phishing or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Such breaches could result in unauthorized access to information including customer, supplier, employee, or other company confidential data. We do not carry insurance against these risks, although we do invest in security technology, perform penetration tests from time to time, and design our business processes to attempt to mitigate the risk of such breaches. However, there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber security threats and incidents, none of which has been material to us to date. However, a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and subject us to consequences such as litigation and direct costs associated with incident response.", "PERMNO": 76127, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "TTI"}
