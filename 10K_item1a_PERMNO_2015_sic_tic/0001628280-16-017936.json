{"cik": "771856", "company": "CHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-07-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known, or those we currently consider insignificant, may also impair our business operations in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe historically incurred losses from operating activities, expect losses for the foreseeable future, require significant capital and may never achieve profitability.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a net loss of approximately $10.4 million and $13.1 million, respectively. As of April 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $62.5 million. As of April 30, 2016, we had negative working capital of $1 million and cash and cash equivalents of $2.6 million. Subsequently, on June 15, 2016, we issued shares of our common stock in a public offering, generating net proceeds of approximately $4.3 million. As of June 30, 2016, we had $5.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand are adequate to fund our operations through at least August of 2017.\nThe amount of our losses and liquidity requirements may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter and will depend on, among other factors:\n\u2022\nthe cost of continuing to build out our TumorGraft Technology Platform;\n\u2022\nthe cost and rate of progress toward growing our TOS businesses;\n\u2022\nthe cost and rate of progress toward building our sales forces;\n\u2022\nthe cost of increasing our research and development;\n\u2022\nthe cost of renting our laboratory and animal testing facilities and payment for associated services;\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of obtaining and maintaining any necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe cost of expanding and building out our infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nthe cost incurred in hiring and maintaining qualified personnel.\nCurrently, the Company derives revenue from POS products and TOS products, while pursuing efforts to further develop bioinformatics from its TumorBank and its TumorGraft Technology Platform. In addition, we are building our sales and marketing\noperations to grow the sales of our TOS products. Our POS products will not be the focus of our groth moving forward. Accordingly, we expect to generate operating losses in the future until such time as we are able to generate significantly more revenue.\nTo become profitable, we will need to generate revenues to offset our operating costs, including our research and development and general and administrative expenses. We may not achieve or, if achieved, sustain our revenue or profit objectives. Our losses may increase in the future, and, ultimately, we may have to cease operations.\nIn order to grow revenues, we must invest capital to implement our sales and marketing efforts and to successfully develop our bioinformatics from our TumorBank and our TumorGraft Technology Platform. Because we do not have sufficient history of commercial efforts, our sales and marketing efforts may never generate significant increases in revenues or achieve profitability and it is likely that we will be required to raise additional capital to continue our operations as currently contemplated. If we must devote a substantial amount of time to raising capital, it will delay our ability to achieve our business goals within the time frames that we now expect, which could increase the amount of capital we need. In addition, the amount of time expended by our management on fundraising distracts them from concentrating on our business affairs. If we require additional capital and are not successful in raising the needed capital, we may have to cease operations.\nWe may incur greater costs than anticipated, which could result in sustained losses.\nWe use reasonable efforts to assess and predict the expenses necessary to pursue our business strategies. However, implementing our business strategies may require more employees, capital equipment, supplies or other expenditure items than management has predicted. Similarly, the cost of compensating additional management, employees and consultants or other operating costs may be more than we estimate, which could result in ongoing and sustained losses.\nWe may not be able to implement our business strategies which could impair our ability to continue operations.\nImplementation of our business strategies will depend in large part on our ability to (i) attract and maintain a significant number of customers; (ii) effectively provide acceptable services to our customers; (iii) develop and license new products and technologies; (iv) maintain appropriate internal procedures, policies, and systems; (v) hire, train, and retain skilled employees and management; (vi) continue to operate despite increasing competition in our industry; and (vii) establish, develop and maintain our name recognition. Our inability to obtain or maintain any or all these factors could impair our ability to implement our business strategies successfully, which could have material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in FDA\u2019s regulatory oversight of laboratory-developed tests such as our POS services that are currently under consideration or by other changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to our POS services imposed by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries in which our services are provided.\nThe FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, such as our POS services, but has generally not exercised its regulatory authority for most LDTs performed by CLIA-certified laboratories such as our facilities. The FDA has announced several regulatory and guidance initiatives that may impact our business, including by increasing FDA\u2019s regulation of LDTs.\nOn July 31, 2014 the FDA notified Congress of the FDA\u2019s intent to issue a draft oversight framework for LDTs based on risk to patients rather than whether they were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory. This draft oversight framework includes pre-market review for higher-risk LDTs, like those used to guide treatment decisions, including the many companion diagnostics that have entered the market as LDTs. In addition, under the draft framework, the FDA would continue to exercise enforcement discretion for low-risk LDTs and LDTs for rare diseases, among others. The framework would be phased in over many years. If this framework is implemented, these initiatives may lead to an increased regulatory burden on our Company, which may result in a requirement for FDA review and clearance or approval of our POS services. Any increased regulatory burdens would probably result in an increase in the cost of our POS services and could keep us from selling POS services until such time as any required FDA clearance or approval is obtained. If our POS services become subject to FDA\u2019s approval and oversight as medical devices, the additional regulatory burdens may be significant, and may require the addition of experienced medical device quality, regulatory and compliance personnel to assume these burdens. Any POS services that we provide in other countries may be similarly subject to regulation by foreign regulatory agencies, which would also increase our costs. These matters could hurt our business and our financial results.\nOur laboratories are subject to regulation and licensure requirements, and the healthcare industry is highly regulated; we may face substantial penalties, and our business activities may be impacted, if we fail to comply.\nOur TumorGraft products are performed in laboratories that are subject to state regulation and licensure requirements. Such regulation and requirements are subject to change, and may result in additional costs or delays in providing our products to our customers. In addition, the healthcare industry in general is highly regulated in the United States at both the federal and state levels. We seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, but many of the laws and regulations potentially applicable to us are vague or unclear. These laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by an authority in a way that could require us to make changes in our business. We may not be able to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or sell our products. If we fail to do so, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or fines or lose the authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third parties. If any of these events happened, they could hurt our business and financial results.\nIf our laboratory facilities are damaged or destroyed, or we have a dispute with one of our landlords, our business would be negatively affected.\nWe currently utilize two laboratories in Baltimore, Maryland and New York, New York to perform the work of our tumor studies and develop and bank our TumorGraft Technology Platform models. The lab in Baltimore is where a majority of the work is performed. If this facility, or, to a lesser degree, any of our other facilities, were to be significantly damaged or destroyed, we could suffer a loss of our ongoing and future drug studies, as well as our TumorBank. In addition, we lease the space for each of these laboratories from a third party. If we had a dispute with any of our landlords or otherwise could not utilize this space, it would take time to find and move to a new facility, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nAny health crisis impacting our colony of laboratory mice could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur TumorGraft operations depend on having a colony of live mice available. If this population experienced a health crisis, such as a virus or other pathogen, such crisis would affect the success of our existing POS and TOS business and future business, as we would have to rebuild the population and repeat current TumorGrafts.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our products and may need to rely on third parties to successfully market and sell our products and generate revenues.\nCurrently, we rely on the internet, word of mouth, and a small sales force to market our services. We have to compete with other pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life science technology and service companies to recruit, hire, train, and retain marketing and sales personnel. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales, and as a result, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe will continue to be dependent upon key employees.\nOur success, currently, is dependent upon the efforts of several full-time key employees, the loss of the services of one or more of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We intend to continue to develop our management team and attract and retain qualified personnel in all functional areas to expand and grow our business. This may be difficult in the healthcare industry where competition for skilled personnel is intense.\nBecause our industry is very competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources and more experience in research and development, we may not succeed in selling or increasing sales of our products and technologies.\nWe are engaged in a rapidly changing and highly competitive field. Potential competitors in the United States and abroad are numerous and include providers of clinical research services, most of which have substantially greater capital resources and more experience in research and development capabilities. Furthermore, new companies will likely enter our market from the United States and abroad, as scientific developments surrounding other pre-clinical and clinical services grow in the multibillion dollar oncology marketplace. Our competitors may succeed in selling their products to our pharmaceutical and biotech customers more effectively than we sell our products. In addition, academic institutions, hospitals, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations also may conduct similar research, seek patent protection, and may develop and commercially introduce competing products or technologies on their own or through joint ventures. If one or more of our competitors succeeds in developing similar technologies and products that are more effective or successful than any of those that we currently sell or will develop, our results of operations will be significantly adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete as effectively.\nIt is important in the healthcare industry to obtain patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products, and processes. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to obtain, enjoy, and enforce protection for any products we have, develop or acquire under United States and foreign patent laws and other intellectual property laws, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Where appropriate, we will seek patent protection for certain aspects of our technology. However, while our TumorGraft Technology Platform is proprietary and requires significant know-how to both initiate and operate, it is not patented. It is, therefore, possible for competitors to develop other implantation procedures, or to discover the same procedures utilized by us, that could compete with us in our market.\nIt also is unclear whether efforts to secure our trade secrets will provide useful protection. While we will use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors resulting in a loss of protection. Enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Finally, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nWe rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also seek to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Our trade secrets may also be obtained by third parties by other means, such as breaches of our physical or computer security systems. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nClaims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe healthcare industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the United States and also are maintained in secrecy outside the United States until the application is published. Accordingly, we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes the patents or patent applications of others. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time-consuming and could likely:\n\u2022\nresult in costly litigation;\n\u2022\ndivert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u2022\nrequire us to develop non-infringing technology; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nPatients are unable to obtain reimbursement from third-party payers for our services, limiting the market acceptance of our services, and as a result we may not achieve significant revenues.\nCurrently, patients are unable to obtain reimbursement from third party payers for our services. Furthermore, the continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (\u201cHMOs\u201d) and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care could affect our revenues and profitability. In the U.S., given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the inability to obtain reimbursement from third party payers for our services limits the market acceptance of our services. As a result, we may not achieve significant revenues.\nOur ability to expand our business may depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our proposed formulations and products and related treatments are obtained by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. The trend toward managed health care in the U.S. and the concurrent growth of organizations\nsuch as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and drugs, as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs, may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our services.\nTOS studies are subject to cancellation based on changes in customer\u2019s development plans.\nOur revenue is primarily derived from studies performed for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to assist in the development of oncology drugs. There are many factors that could result in the change of our customers development plans for specific drugs, including without limitation to their research and development budgets and drug development strategies. These changes could lead to the cancellation or modification of on-going or planned studies. This would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s revenue growth and profit margin.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to as the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that our recent public offering, taken together with our private placements and other transactions that have occurred over the past three years, we may have triggered an \u201cownership change\u201d limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which potentially could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nRisks Related to Our common Stock\nIf our stockholders\u2019 equity continues to remain below $2,500,000, our common stock may be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nOn March 21, 2016, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq advising us of our failure to comply with the required minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders\u2019 equity for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, pursuant to Nasdaq listing rule 5550(b)(1). We fell below the minimum requirement with reported stockholders\u2019 equity of $2,259,000 in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended January 31, 2016. Nasdaq stated in the letter that, pursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules, we have 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance. If the plan is accepted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq may grant us an extension of up to 180 calendar days from March 21, 2016 (or until September 19, 2016) to regain compliance. If the plan is not accepted by Nasdaq, we may appeal the decision to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel.\nIn May 2016, the Company submitted materials to Nasdaq outlining the Company's plan to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Based on the Staff review and the materials submitted, on June 7, 2016, the Staff notified the Company the plan was accepted and an extension was granted. If the Company fails to evidence compliance upon filing its periodic report for the quarter ended July 31, 2016 with the SEC and Nasdaq, the Staff will provide written notification that the Company's securities will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal the Staff\u2019s determination to a Hearings Panel.\nThere can be no assurance that Nasdaq will grant our request for continued lisitng on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or that our plans to comply with the required minimum of $2,500,000 in shareholders\u2019 equity will be successful. To the extent that we are unable to resolve the listing deficiency, there is a risk that our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq and would likely trade only on the over-the-counter market (the \u201cOTC\u201d). If our common stock were to trade on the OTC, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and it may be difficult to attract security analysts\u2019 coverage. In addition, in the event our common stock is delisted, broker-dealers transacting in our common stock would be subject to certain additional regulatory burdens, which may discourage them from effecting transactions in our common stock, thus further limiting the liquidity of our common stock and potentially resulting in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock.\nIn addition, on October 28, 2015 we received a notification letter from Nasdaq confirming our notification to Nasdaq of our non-compliance with Nasdaq listing rule 5605(b)(1)(A), which requires that our board consist of a majority of independent directors. Such non-compliance occurred when a former director of ours did not stand for re-election at our most recent annual stockholder meeting. As of April 11, 2016, we appointed an additional independent director. Therefore, our board currently consists of four independent directors and three non-independent directors. However, if we fail to maintain compliance with this requirement, our shares may be delisted.\nWe have a limited market for our common stock, which makes our securities very speculative.\nTrading activity in our common stock is and has been limited. As a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that a more active market for our common stock will develop, or if one should develop, there is no assurance that it will be sustained. This could severely limit the liquidity of our common stock, and would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and on our ability to raise additional capital. Furthermore, like many stocks quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, trading in our common stock is thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance.\nInvestment in our common stock may be diluted if we issue additional shares in the future.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock, which will reduce shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership and may dilute per share value. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock. As of July 15, 2016, we had 11,237,176 shares of common stock issued and 10,967,491 shares outstanding. The future issuance of all or part of the remaining authorized common stock would result in substantial dilution in the percentage of the common stock held by existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services, acquisitions, or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by existing shareholders, and might have an adverse effect on any market for our common stock.\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities in the future, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Sale of additional equity and/or convertible debt securities at prices below certain levels will trigger anti-dilution provisions with respect to certain securities we have previously sold. If additional funds are raised through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, lenders under the credit facility or holders of these debt securities or preferred stock would likely have rights that are senior to the rights of holders of our common stock, and any credit facility or additional securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operation.\nPotential future sales or issuances of our common stock to raise capital, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause dilution to our current stockholders and the price of our common stock to fall.\nWe have historically supported our operations through the issuance of equity and expect to continue to do so in the future. Although we may not be successful in obtaining financing through equity sales on terms that are favorable to us, if at all, any such sales that do occur could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing holders of our common stock.\nAdditionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities to any new investors, or the anticipation of such sales, could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nThe exercise of outstanding options and warrants may dilute current shareholders.\nAs of July 15, 2016, there were 4,322,597 warrants and options outstanding of which 3,847,146 were vested to purchase shares of our common stock. The exercise of a substantial number of these outstanding warrants and options could adversely affect our share price and dilute current shareholders.\nOur stock price is volatile and therefore investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it.\nThe stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the healthcare payment system overseas to the degree we receive revenue from such healthcare systems overseas;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us of significant acquisition, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nsales of significant shares of stock by large investors;\n\u2022\nintellectual property, product liability, or other litigation against us; and\n\u2022\nthe other key facts described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nCertain provisions of our charter and bylaws and of our contractual agreements contain provisions that could delay and discourage takeover attempts and any attempts to replace our current management by shareholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our contractual agreements could make it difficult for or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us or changing our board of directors and management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nrequirements that our stockholders comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to our board of directors or to place stockholders\u2019 proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nin connection with private placements of our stock in 2011, 2013 and 2015, we covenanted that we would not merge or consolidate with another company unless either the transaction and the trading volume of our stock met certain thresholds and qualifications or we obtained the consent of certain of the investors who purchased our stock in those private placements.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and make a takeover more difficult to complete, even if such a transaction were in the stockholders\u2019 interest.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making it more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of us, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. We also are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner and prohibit the voting of shares held by persons acquiring certain numbers of shares without obtaining requisite approval. The statutes have the effect of making it more difficult to effect a change in control of a Delaware company.\nOur management and six significant stockholders collectively own a substantial majority of our common stock.\nCollectively, our officers, our directors and six significant stockholders own or exercise voting and investment control of approximately 52% of our outstanding common stock as of July 15, 2016. As a result, investors may be prevented from affecting matters involving our company, including:\n\u2022\nthe composition of our board of directors and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers;\n\u2022\nany determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations;\n\u2022\nour acquisition or disposition of assets; and\n\u2022\nour corporate financing activities.\nFurthermore, this concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in a company that is controlled by a small number of stockholders.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends in the past and have no plans to issue cash dividends in the future, which could cause the value of our common stock to have a lower value than other similar companies which do pay cash dividends.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not anticipate any cash dividends being paid to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion. As we have no plans to issue cash dividends in the future, our common stock could be less desirable to other investors and as a result, the value of our common stock may decline, or fail to reach the valuations of other similarly situated companies who have historically paid cash dividends in the past.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of\nour common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us was to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 12146, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CSBR"}
