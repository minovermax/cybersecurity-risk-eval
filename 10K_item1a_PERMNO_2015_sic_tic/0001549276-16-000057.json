{"cik": "1549276", "company": "LaPorte Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nA significant portion of our loans are commercial loans, consisting of commercial real estate, five or more family, and commercial business loans, which carry greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family real estate.\nAt December 31, 2015, $133.1 million, or 38.6% of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate, five or more family, and commercial business loans. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate, five or more family, and commercial business loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family real estate. These loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u2022\ncommercial real estate loans-repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service;\n\u2022\nfive or more family loans - repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover property maintenance and debt service; and\n\u2022\ncommercial and industrial loans-repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business.\nIf loans that are collateralized by real estate or other business assets become troubled and the value of the collateral has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nBecause our mortgage warehousing line of business produces a significant portion of our interest income, the loss of such income due to increased competition, the loss of key personnel, or a reduction in volume of originations would negatively affect our net income.\nWe operate a mortgage warehousing line of business. Under this program, we provide financing to approved mortgage companies for the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. Each individual mortgage is assigned to us until the loan is sold to the secondary market by the mortgage company. We take possession of each original note and forward such note to the end investor once the mortgage company has sold the loan. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income (including fees) from mortgage warehouse lending totaled $6.1 million, or 32.5%, of total interest income.\nCompetition in mortgage warehouse lending has increased on a national level as new lenders, especially community and regional banks, have begun entering the mortgage warehouse business. If increased competition occurs and our mortgage warehousing line of business declines, we would be forced to invest our funds in potentially lower yielding interest earning assets, which would negatively affect our earnings. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of key personnel in our mortgage warehousing line of business, such as our Senior Vice President of Mortgage Warehouse Lending, could adversely affect our business. In addition, if interest rates rise, the demand for residential mortgage loans could decline, and as a result, our mortgage warehousing line of business could decline, which would adversely affect our net income.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. While our allowance for loan losses was $3.6 million, or 1.05%, of total loans at December 31, 2015, material additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe LaPorte Savings Bank\u2019s reliance on public funds and brokered deposits could adversely affect its liquidity and operating results.\nAmong other sources of funds, The LaPorte Savings Bank relies on public funds and brokered deposits to provide funds with which to make loans and provide for its other liquidity needs. On December 31, 2015, public funds and brokered deposits amounted to $85.1 million and $22.4 million, or 21.8% and 5.7%, respectively, of total deposits. All of the public funds deposits at December 31, 2015 were multiple deposit relationships with local public entities within LaPorte and Porter Counties of Indiana. Public funds often fluctuate based on the municipalities\u2019 liquidity needs as well as interest rates paid. All of the brokered deposits are from CDARS, a brokered deposit network that allows members to mitigate the liquidity risk related to brokered deposits. Generally public funds and brokered deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits. In the future, those depositors may not replace their deposits when they mature, or the Bank may have to pay a higher rate of interest to keep those deposits or to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources. Not being able to maintain or replace those deposits as they mature would adversely affect the Bank\u2019s liquidity. Paying higher deposit rates to maintain or replace those deposits would adversely affect our net interest margin and operating results.\nChanging interest rates may hurt our profits and asset values.\nOur ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between:\n\u2022\nthe interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n\u2022\nthe interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nOur liabilities generally have shorter maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility as market interest rates change. In periods of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities, resulting in a decline in our net interest income. In periods of declining interest rates, our net interest income is generally positively affected although such positive effects may be reduced or eliminated by prepayments of loans and redemptions of callable securities. In addition, when long-term interest rates are not significantly higher than short-term rates a \u201cflat\u201d yield curve is created and our interest rate spread may decrease thus reducing net interest income. Finally, federal initiatives designed to reduce mortgage interest rates may reduce our loan income without a corresponding reduction in funding costs, thus decreasing our spreads. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Interest Rate Risk.\u201d\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of our securities classified as available for sale totaled $122.2 million. Unrealized net gains on available-for-sale securities totaled $1.1 million at December 31, 2015 and are reported, net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders\u2019 equity. However, a rise in interest rates could cause a decrease in the fair value of securities available for sale in future periods which would have an adverse effect on shareholders\u2019 equity.\nDepending on market conditions, we often place more emphasis on enhancing our net interest margin rather than matching the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. In particular, we believe that the increased net interest income resulting from a mismatch in the maturity of our asset and liability portfolios can, during periods of stable or declining interest rates provide high enough returns to justify increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates. As a result, our results of operations, net interest margin, and the economic value of our equity will remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to declines in the difference between long- and short-term rates.\nIncome from secondary mortgage market operations is volatile, and we may incur losses or charges with respect to our secondary mortgage market operations which would negatively affect our earnings.\nWe generally sell in the secondary market the longer term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, earning noninterest income in the form of gains on sale. When interest rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall and may reduce the number of loans available for sale. In addition to interest rate levels, weak or deteriorating economic conditions also tend to reduce loan demand. Although we sell loans in the secondary market without recourse, we are required to give customary representations and warranties to the buyers. If we breach those representations and warranties, the buyers can require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase. Because we retain the servicing rights on many loans we sell in the secondary market, we are required to record a mortgage servicing right asset, which we test quarterly for impairment. The value of mortgage servicing rights tend to increase with rising interest rates and decrease with falling interest rates. If we are required to record an impairment charge, that would hurt our earnings.\nWe could potentially recognize goodwill impairment charges, which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn connection with our 2007 acquisition of City Savings Financial Corporation, we recorded goodwill equaling $8.4 million. We annually measure the fair value of our investment in The LaPorte Savings Bank to determine that the fair value equals or exceeds the carrying value of our investment, including goodwill. If the fair value of our investment in the Bank does not equal or exceed the carrying value, we will be required to record goodwill impairment charges which may adversely affect future earnings. The fair value of a banking franchise can fluctuate downward based on a number of factors that are beyond management\u2019s control, (e.g. adverse trends in the general economy or interest rates). As a result of impairment testing performed as of October 31, 2015, we did not record an impairment charge. There can be no assurance that our banking franchise value will not decline in the future to a level necessitating goodwill impairment charges to operations, which could be material to our results of operations.\nHistorically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nIn recent years, it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, market rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased have been at lower levels than available prior to 2008, which can result in lower average yields on interest earning assets than we have experienced in the past. Our ability to lower our interest expense to offset lower interest income is limited at these historic low interest rates. Should the Federal Reserve Board maintain low interest rates in the future, our net interest income (the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities) may be adversely affected and may even decrease, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nNegative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets may adversely affect our operations and results.\nAny negative developments in the global credit and securitization markets may lead to uncertainty in the financial markets. Future economic downturns can cause additional deterioration in loan portfolio quality at many institutions, including The LaPorte Savings Bank. In addition, the value of real estate collateral supporting many home mortgages may decline. Bank and bank holding company stock prices could be negatively affected, as well as the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets. The negative developments that occurred around 2008, along with the turmoil and uncertainties that have accompanied them, have heavily influenced the formulation and enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition to the rules and regulations yet to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, the potential exists for other new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices, capital requirements, and liquidity standards to be enacted. Bank regulatory agencies are expected to continue to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. Any negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments, may negatively impact our operations by further increasing our costs, restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, these risks could affect the value of our loan portfolio as well as the value of our investment portfolio, which would also negatively affect our financial performance.\nAdverse conditions in the local economy or real estate market could hurt our profits.\nOur local economy may affect our future growth possibilities and operations in our primary market area. Our future growth opportunities depend on the growth and stability of our regional economy and our ability to expand in our market area. Although we have expanded into the St. Joseph, Michigan, market and increased lending in other contiguous counties surrounding our market area, a majority of our loans, excluding the warehouse lending lines, are to customers in LaPorte and Porter counties, Indiana. Continued adverse conditions or minimal improvement in our local economy may limit funds available for deposit and may negatively affect our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans on a timely basis, both of which could have an impact on our profitability. Also, a decline in real estate valuations in our markets would lower the value of the collateral securing our loans.\nSlow growth in our market area has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our performance.\nEconomic and population growth within our market area has for several decades been below the national average. Management believes that these factors have adversely affected our profitability and our ability to increase our loans and deposits. The Porter County market, due to its proximity to Chicago, Illinois, has been a stronger market than eastern LaPorte County. However, the real estate values and economic activity for both markets experienced declines and are still recovering from the weak economic environment that began in 2008. According to the Greater Northwest Indiana Association of Realtors, the average sales price of homes in LaPorte and Porter Counties for 2015 continues to be 6.7% and 5.6% below the average prices realized in 2008. The average sales price of homes in Southwest Michigan, which is the market area for our St. Joseph, Michigan, loan production office has increased 21.2% from 2010 to 2015. The average sales price of commercial real estate properties in the cities of LaPorte and Michigan City, Indiana, has remained stable from 2008 to 2015.\nFinancial reform legislation has, among other things, tightened capital standards, created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and could result in new laws and regulations that could further increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations based on numerous studies and reports prepared for Congress. The federal agencies were given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations, and consequently many new regulations have been implemented. The federal agencies may continue to implement more rules and regulations, the details and impact of which may not be known for many months or years.\nAmong other things, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Reserve Board supervises and regulates all savings and loan holding companies that were formerly regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, including LaPorte Bancorp, Inc.;\n\u2022\nthe federal prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits has been eliminated, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. This change increased our interest expense;\n\u2022\nthe Federal Reserve Board set minimum capital levels for depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital were restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. These new capital rules took effect on January 1, 2015 for depository institutions with consolidated assets greater than $1.0 billion;\n\u2022\nthe federal banking regulators were required to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives;\n\u2022\nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) which was established has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like The LaPorte Savings Bank, are examined by their applicable bank regulators; and\n\u2022\nstate attorneys general have the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.\nIn addition to the risks noted above, our operating and compliance costs could further increase our noninterest expense and has increased as a result of Dodd-Frank Act rules and regulations. The need to comply with additional rules and regulations, will also divert management\u2019s time from managing our operations. Higher capital levels could reduce our ability to grow and increase our interest-earning assets which could adversely affect our return on shareholders\u2019 equity.\nNew regulations could restrict our ability to originate and sell loans.\nIn 2014, the CFPB implemented a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which holds lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the ability-to-repay standard. Under the rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u2022\nexcessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u2022\ninterest-only payments;\n\u2022\nnegative-amortization; and\n\u2022\nterms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers or could make it more expensive/and or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn January 2015, the FDIC\u2019s new rule for regulatory risk-based capital applicable to The LaPorte Savings Bank became effective. The rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which were effective for The LaPorte Savings Bank on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements include: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and resulting in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for The LaPorte Savings Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were unable to comply with such requirements.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry within our market area is intense. In our market area we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and broader range of deposit and loan products offered by our competition may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets and profitability. We expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our ability to successfully implement our business plan, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the future.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe LaPorte Savings Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, as its chartering authority, and by the FDIC. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board regulates and oversees the Company. We also belong to the Federal Home Loan Bank system and are subject to certain limited regulations promulgated by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. This regulation and supervision limits the activities in which we may engage. The purpose of regulation and supervision is primarily to protect our depositors and borrowers and, also in the case of FDIC regulation, the FDIC\u2019s insurance fund. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in the exercise of their supervisory and enforcement powers. They may, among other things, impose restrictions on the operation of a banking institution, the classification of assets by such institution and such institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Regulatory and law enforcement authorities also have wide discretion and extensive enforcement powers under various consumer protection and civil rights laws, including the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Any change in the laws or regulations applicable to us, or in banking regulators\u2019 supervisory policies or examination procedures, whether by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, other state or federal regulators, or the U.S. Congress could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur stock price may be volatile due to limited trading volume.\nLaPorte Bancorp\u2019s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. However, our stock is thinly traded and trades involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock. It may also be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price.\nWe are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology, including the risk of cyber-attack or cyber-theft.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, and many other aspects of our business. We depend on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our data processing systems, computers, networks, and communications systems. Although we take numerous protective measures and otherwise endeavor to protect and maintain the privacy and security of confidential data, these systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, other malicious code, cyber-attacks, cyber-theft, and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of these type of events were to occur, this potentially could jeopardize confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our systems or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers\u2019 operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are not fully covered by our insurance. Security breaches in our Internet banking activities could expose us to possible liability and deter customers from using our systems. We rely on standard Internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures that could result in damage to our reputation and our business. Although we perform most data processing functions internally, we outsource certain services to third parties. If our third-party providers encounter operational difficulties or security breaches, it could affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which could significantly affect our business operations.\nOur operations rely on numerous external vendors.\nWe rely on a number of external vendors to provide us with products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with these service level agreements because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which in turn could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected to the extent such an agreement is not renewed by the third-party vendor or is renewed on terms less favorable to us.\nOur business and operations could be significantly impacted if we or our third-party vendors suffer failure or disruptions of information processing systems, systems failures or security breaches.\nWe have become increasingly dependent on communications, data processing, and other information technology systems to manage and conduct our business and support our day-to-day banking activities, some of which are provided through third-parties. If we or our third-party vendors encounter difficulties or become the subject of a cyber-attack on or in the form of another breach of their operational systems, data, or infrastructure, or if we have difficulty communicating with any such third-party system, our business and operations could suffer. Any failure or disruption to our systems, or those of a third-party vendor, could impede our transaction processing, service delivery, customer relationship management, data processing, financial reporting, or risk management. Although we take ongoing monitoring, detection, and prevention measures and perform penetration testing and periodic risk assessments, our computer systems, software, and networks and those of our third-party vendors may be or become vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious code, or cyber-attacks beyond what we can reasonably anticipate and such events could result in material loss. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. Security breaches in our online banking systems could also have an adverse effect on our reputation and could subject us to possible liability. Additionally, we could suffer disruptions to our systems or damage to our network infrastructure from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. There can be no assurance that our policies, procedures, and protective measures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption or security breach, or the policies, procedures, and protective measures of our third-party vendors, will be effective. If significant failure, interruption, or security breaches do occur in our processing systems or those of our third-party providers, we could suffer damage to our reputation, a loss of customer business, additional regulatory scrutiny, or exposure to civil litigation, additional costs, and possible financial liability. In addition, our business is highly dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor, on a continuous basis, a large number of transactions. To do so, we are dependent on our employees and therefore, the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization, including losses resulting from human error. We could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our employees cause a significant operational breakdown or failure. If we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure, systems, controls, and personnel relative to our size and products and services, our ability to effectively operate our business may be impaired and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We also may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.\nThe Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, the Company\u2019s business could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts the Company from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the Merger occurs without the consent of Horizon. These restrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. In addition, the terms of the Merger Agreement limit our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends other than the normal quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share without the consent of Horizon. Horizon has agreed not to unreasonably withhold any such consent.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger.\nBefore the Merger and the Bank Merger may be completed, Horizon must obtain approvals from the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. In determining whether to grant these approvals the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. An adverse development in either party\u2019s regulatory standing or other factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their receipt. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger or the Bank Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger or the Bank Merger. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Merger or the Bank Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger or the Bank Merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. These conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed by February 28, 2017, either the Company or Horizon may choose not to proceed with the Merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time. In addition, Horizon and the Company may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances and the Company may be required to pay a termination fee.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, the Company\u2019s business may be adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors seeks another merger or business combination, the Company\u2019s shareholders cannot be certain that the Company will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration Horizon has agreed to provide in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to pay a termination fee of $3.76 million to Horizon.\nIf the Merger is not completed, the Company will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.\nThe Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, the Company would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.\nBecause the market price of Horizon common stock fluctuates, the Company\u2019s shareholders cannot be certain of the precise value of the stock portion of the Merger consideration that they may receive in the Merger.\nAt the time the Merger is completed, each issued and outstanding share of Company common stock will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. The merger consideration consists of the right to receive, at each of the Company\u2019s shareholder\u2019s election, $17.50 per share in cash or 0.629 shares of Horizon common stock, or a combination of both, for each share of Company common stock, subject to allocation provisions. The Merger Agreement provides that, in the aggregate, 65% of the outstanding common shares of the Company will be converted into the right to receive shares of Horizon common stock and the remaining 35% of the outstanding common shares of the Company will be converted into the right to receive cash.\nThere will be a time lapse between each of the date of the mailing of the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Merger, the date on which the Company\u2019s shareholders vote on a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at a special meeting of shareholders and the date on which the Company\u2019s shareholders entitled to receive Horizon\u2019s common stock actually receive such shares. The market value of Horizon\u2019s common stock may fluctuate during these periods as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Horizon\u2019s businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are outside the control of the Company and Horizon. Consequently, at the time the Company\u2019s shareholders must decide whether to adopt the Merger Agreement, they will not know the actual market value of the Horizon common stock that they may be entitled to receive at the effective time of the Merger. The Company\u2019s shareholders should obtain current stock quotations for the Horizon common stock before voting their shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 92308, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "LPSB"}
