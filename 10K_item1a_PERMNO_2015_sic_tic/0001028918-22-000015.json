RISK FACTORS\nOwnership of our common stock involves certain risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.\nGENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS RISKS\nThe continuing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has impacted household, business, economic, and market conditions, including California and the western United States where we conduct nearly all of our business. While economic activity improved significantly during 2021, the pace of economic recovery remains uneven across some industries and geographies, and some industries have been impacted more severely than others by specific variants and by supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nDuring 2021, we saw an improvement in macroeconomic variables used in the forecasts utilized in establishing our ACL, which were partially offset by provisioning for new loan originations. We recorded a total of $70.9 million provision recapture, compared to a $191.8 million provision expense in 2020. Additionally, throughout the pandemic our operations have been impacted by the need to close certain offices and limit how customers conduct business through our branch network. Many of our employees continue to work remotely on a hybrid model that includes working remotely, which exposes us to increased cybersecurity risks such as phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, all of which could expose us to liability and could seriously disrupt our business operations.\nGovernments have taken unprecedented financial and monetary steps in response to the pandemic. For example, in late March 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to inject more than $2 trillion of financial assistance into the U.S. economy, followed by additional COVID relief legislation of approximately $900 million in December 2020. In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act, also called the COVID-19 Stimulus Package or American Rescue Plan, Pub L. No. 117-2, was enacted to inject an additional $1.9 trillion in financial relief and economic stimulus. The Federal Reserve also took decisive and sweeping actions. From March 15, 2020 through 2021, their actions included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 25 basis points, a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and other investments, and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and on our business, results of operations, and prospects is still uncertain, and will depend on a number of evolving factors, including:\n\u2022The duration, extent, and severity of the pandemic. COVID-19 has not yet been contained\u037e continuing spread and rise of new variants could affect significantly more households and businesses, or cause additional limitations on commercial activity, increased unemployment, increased property vacancy rates, and general economic and financial instability. The continuation of the pandemic may also negatively impact regional economic conditions for a period of time, resulting in declines in loan demand and collateral values. The duration and severity of the pandemic continues to be impossible to predict, as is the potential for a seasonal or other resurgence. We also believe we will continue to see the economic effects of the pandemic even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, which is expected to continue to affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects.\n\u2022The response of governmental authorities. To date, many of the actions of governmental authorities, including eviction forbearance, occupancy restrictions, and vaccine mandates, have been directed toward\ncurtailing household and business activity to contain COVID-19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetary policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. The ultimate success or impact of these actions and their effect on our customers and the economy generally is still unclear. Further, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on our business.\n\u2022The effect on our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties are affecting individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. Negative impacts on our customers could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, and losses on our loans.\n\u2022The effect on economies and markets. Whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting. Governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interest-rate environment and financial-market activity and could have lasting effects on taxes and other economic factors, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe economic environment could pose significant challenges for the Company and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are dependent on the U.S. economy, generally, and markets we serve, specifically. We primarily serve markets in California, and major metropolitan areas in Washington, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada, though certain of our products and services are offered nationwide. Financial stress on our customers as a result of an uncertain future economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s customers and their ability to repay their loans, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. A weakening of these conditions in the markets in which we operate would likely have an adverse effect on us and others in the financial institutions industry. For example, a deterioration in economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for credit losses. We may also face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022economic conditions that negatively affect real estate values and the job market may result in the deterioration of the credit quality of our loan portfolio, and such deterioration in credit quality could have a negative impact on our business;\n\u2022a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;\n\u2022a decrease in deposit balances, including low-cost and noninterest-bearing deposits;\n\u2022a decrease in the value of our loans or other assets secured by collateral such as commercial or residential real estate;\n\u2022a decrease in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities;\n\u2022a decrease in consumer confidence levels and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities;\n\u2022the processes we use to estimate our allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d) under the CECL methodology requires the use of complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which are difficult to estimate, and adverse economic conditions or expected economic conditions may require us to provide for a significantly greater ACL; and\n\u2022our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the methodologies and approaches we use become less effective in controlling charge-offs.\nThe threat of near-term inflation poses risk to the economy overall, and could indirectly pose challenges to our clients and to our business. Elevated inflation can impact our business customers through loss of purchasing power for their customers, leading to lower sales. Rising inflation can also increase input and inventory costs for our customers, forcing them to raise their prices or lower their profitability. Supply chain disruption, also leading to inflation, can delay our customers\u2019 shipping ability, or timing on receiving inputs for their production or inventory. Inflation can lead to higher wages for our business customers, increasing costs. All of these inflationary risks for our business customer base can be financially detrimental, leading to increased likelihood that the customer may default\non a loan. In addition, sustained inflationary pressure can lead the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) to raise interest rates, which increases our interest rate risk. To the extent such conditions exist or worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including military tension between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism, or other geopolitical events.\nAdverse economic conditions in California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, and/or Nevada, may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans and reduce the value of the assets we hold as collateral.\nOur business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in California, and to a lesser extent Washington, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada. Difficult economic conditions in these markets may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. In addition, demand for our products and services may decline. Declines in the real estate market could hurt our business because if real estate values were to decline, the collateral for our loans would provide less security. As a result, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate would be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. The majority of our loans, approximately 61% of the aggregate outstanding principal as of December 31, 2021, are secured by real estate located within California.\nMARKET RISKS\nInterest rate changes, which are beyond our control, could harm our profitability.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest income and dividends we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Any change in general market interest rates, whether as a result of changes in the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve or otherwise, may have a significant effect on net interest income and prepayments on our loans. After maintaining its federal funds rate target in a range of 0% to 0.25% since March 2020, the FOMC signaled in early 2022 that the target rate is likely to increase a number of times during 2022.\nOur assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall interest rates or conditions. In general, higher interest rates are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Further, if interest rates decline, our loans may be refinanced at lower rates or paid off and our investments may be prepaid earlier than expected. If that occurs, we may have to redeploy the loan or investment proceeds into lower yielding assets, which might also decrease our income. Also, as many of our loans currently have interest rate floors, a rise in rates may increase the cost of our deposits while the rates on the loans remain at their floors, which could decrease our net interest income. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, loan origination volumes, net interest margin, results of operations, and profitability. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of certain of our assets, including loans, real estate, and investment securities, on our balance sheet.\nWe may incur debt in the future and that debt may also be sensitive to interest rates. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for us, as well as for our borrowers, particularly as implemented by the Federal Reserve, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the federal funds rate target, the discount rate for bank borrowings, and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on us or our customers (including borrowers), and therefore on our results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is low in a rising interest rate environment based on the current profile of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio and low-cost and no-cost deposits. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. At December 31, 2021, we had $3.49 billion in interest-bearing demand deposits. In addition, at December 31, 2021, we had $5.81 billion in money market and savings deposits. If\nthe interest rates on our loans increase comparably faster than the interest rate on our interest-bearing demand deposits, money market, and savings deposits, our core deposit balances may decrease as customers use those funds to repay higher cost loans. In addition, if we need to offer additional interest-bearing demand deposit products or higher interest rates on our current interest-bearing demand, money market, or savings deposit accounts in order to maintain current customers or attract new customers, our interest expense will increase, perhaps materially. Furthermore, if we fail to offer competitive rates sufficient to retain these accounts, our core deposits may decrease, which would require us to seek alternative funding sources or risk slowing our future asset growth. In these circumstances, our net interest income may decrease, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs interest rates rise, our existing customers who have adjustable rate loans may see their loan payments increase and, as a result, may experience difficulty repaying those loans, which in turn could lead to higher losses for us. Increasing delinquencies, non-accrual loans, and defaults lead to higher loan loss provisions, and potentially greater eventual losses that would lower our current profitability and capital ratios.\nWe use derivative financial instruments, primarily consisting of interest rate swaps, to limit our exposure to interest rate risk. No hedging strategy can completely protect us, and the derivative financial instruments we elect may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risk. Poorly designed strategies, inaccurate assumptions, improperly executed transactions, or the failure of a counterparty to fulfill its obligations could serve to increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. Our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility and could result in or magnify losses, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the fair value of our investment securities may reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nAt December 31, 2021, $4.27 billion of our securities were classified as available-for-sale with an aggregate net unrealized loss of $4.7 million. We increase or decrease stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change from the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments, the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities. In the case of equity securities, which have no stated maturity, the declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had stock holdings in the FHLB totaling $17.3 million, $74.5 million in FRB stock, and $25.7 million in other stock, all carried at cost. The stock held by us is evaluated for impairment under applicable accounting standards. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our stock holdings. There can be no assurance that future negative changes to the financial condition of the issuers may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such stock holdings.\nThe replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may have an impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCertain loans made by us were made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. In addition, we also have investments and interest rate derivatives that reference LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020 to facilitate an orderly LIBOR transition, the OCC, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve jointly announced that entering into new contacts using LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create a safety and soundness risk. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR, and\nimmediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has recommended the use of SOFR. SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate. These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between the Bank's costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. For cash products and loans, the ARRC has also recommended Term SOFR, which is a forward-looking SOFR based on SOFR futures and may in part reduce differences between SOFR and LIBOR. To further reduce differences between replacement indices and substitute indices, market practitioners have also gravitated towards credit sensitive rates, the leading among them being the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (\u201cBSBY\u201d). The ARRC announced on October 21, 2020 that they are not well positioned to adjudicate the development of a credit sensitive rate and will not criticize firms solely for using reference rates other than SOFR, such as BSBY. After an extended analysis by a multidisciplinary project team to identify operational and contractual best practices, assess our risks, and identify the detailed list of all financial instruments impacted, we adopted the SOFR family of interest rates for our financial instruments going forward. Under the oversight of our Enterprise Risk Committee, we are managing the transition, facilitating communication with our customers and counterparties, and monitoring the impacts of this transition.\nThere are also operational issues which may create a delay in the transition to SOFR or other substitute indices, leading to uncertainty across the industry. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. The discontinuance of LIBOR and related uncertainty may adversely affect the market value of, the return on, or the expenses associated with our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR. In addition, the market transition away from LIBOR could prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate. Although we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR, the failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCREDIT RISKS\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio in excess of losses previously estimated.\nOur total nonperforming assets amounted to $31.3 million, or 0.15% of our total assets, at December 31, 2021, an increase from $29.2 million, or 0.15% of our total assets, at December 31, 2020. We had $3.2 million of net loan charge-offs for 2021, a decrease from $16.9 million in 2020. We reported a provision recapture of $67.1 million in 2021, compared to a provision expense of $172.3 million in 2020. If increases in our nonperforming assets occur in the future, our net loan charge-offs and/or provision for credit losses may also increase, which may have an adverse effect upon our future results of operations and capital.\nWe seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. These practices generally include analysis of a borrower\u2019s available cash flow (determined using financial statements and tax returns) and cash flow projections, valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers, prior credit history, and liquid asset verifications. Although we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make, we may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria but subsequently deteriorate, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our ACL under the CECL methodology, and allowance for loan and leases losses (\u201cALLL\u201d) prior to January 1, 2020.\nOn January 1, 2020, we changed the way we estimate credit losses by replacing the incurred loss model used to determine the ALLL with the CECL model. The CECL model incorporates the use of and is more reliant on reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions, including, but not limited to: forecasts of GDP growth rates, levels of unemployment, vacancy rates, and changes in the value of commercial real estate properties.\nBecause the CECL methodology is more dependent on future economic forecasts, assumptions, and models than the previous accounting standards, it may result in increases and add volatility to our ACL and future provisions for loan losses. The forecasts, assumptions, and models required by CECL are based upon management\u2019s reasonable judgment in light of information currently available. While we believe our ACL is appropriate for the risk identified in our loan and lease portfolio, we cannot provide assurance that we will not further increase the allowance for credit losses, that it will be sufficient to address losses, or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance.\nAlthough we maintain an ACL at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb future expected credit losses under the CECL model, our ACL may not be adequate to absorb actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Changes in economic, operating, and other conditions, including a sharp decline in real estate values and changes in interest rates, which are beyond our control, may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates, which will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve and the DFPI, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our credit loss reserves. Either agency may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses, based on their judgments, which may be different from those of our management and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur level of credit risk could increase due to our focus on commercial lending and the concentration on small- and middle-market business customers, who can have heightened vulnerability to economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our commercial real estate loans amounted to $11.69 billion, or 81.8% of our total loan portfolio, and our commercial business loans amounted to $2.51 billion, or 17.5% of our total loan portfolio. At such date, our largest outstanding C&I loan was $179.8 million, our largest multiple borrower relationship was $188.5 million, and our largest outstanding CRE loan was $92.4 million. CRE and commercial business loans are generally considered riskier than single-family or multifamily residential loans because they have larger balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. CRE and commercial business loans involve risks because the borrowers\u2019 abilities to repay the loans typically depend primarily on the successful operation of the businesses or the properties securing the loans. Most of the Company\u2019s commercial business loans are made to small- or middle-market business customers who may have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Moreover, a portion of these borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of our borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on all or part of our operations. Federal and state banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy what they perceive to be unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in order to conduct certain activities, including acquisitions, we are required to obtain regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that any required approvals can be obtained, or obtained without conditions or on a timeframe acceptable to the Company. The laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, are continuously reviewed and change frequently. The ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Compliance with such regulations and laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, a change in the Chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve is likely to involve a different\nregulatory agenda element, which could increase bank regulation and supervision and introduce new risks, complexities, and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that laws, rules, and regulations will not be proposed or adopted in the future, which could (i) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (ii) restrict our ability to originate, modify, broker, or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (iii) restrict our ability to collect on defaulted loans or foreclose on property securing loans, (iv) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest, or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or (v) otherwise materially and adversely affect our business or prospects for business. These risks could affect our deposit funding and the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the DFPI, and the CFPB, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a regulatory agency was to determine in its discretion that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against the Bank or our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security, and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information, and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security, and data protection laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, that among other things require privacy disclosures and maintenance of a robust security program that are increasingly subject to change which could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection, and information security-related practices; our collection, use, sharing, retention, and safeguarding of consumer or employee information; disclosures and notifications during a cyber or information security incident; and some of our current or planned business activities. We are also subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, and provides a private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use, and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Our regulators also hold us responsible for privacy and data protection obligations performed by our third-party service providers while providing services to us, as well as disclosures and notifications during a cyber or information security incident.\nNew or changes to existing laws increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives, including increased privacy-related enforcement activity and higher compliance and technology costs, and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to heightened regulatory requirements as our total assets exceed $10 billion.\nOur total assets were approximately $21.09 billion as of December 31, 2021, and our total assets have exceeded $10 billion since July 2018. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on banks and bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, including a more frequent and enhanced regulatory examination regime. In addition, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets (including our bank) are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, with the Federal Reserve maintaining supervision over some consumer related\nregulations. In light of evolving priorities among government and agency leaders, there is some uncertainty as to how the CFPB examination and regulatory authority might impact our business in the near and medium terms.\nSince July 1, 2019, we became subject to reduced interchange income, which has resulted in reduced revenues. Debit card interchange fee restrictions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, which is known as the Durbin Amendment, as implemented by regulations of the Federal Reserve, cap the maximum debit interchange fee that a bank debit card issuer with $10 billion or more in total assets may receive per transaction at the sum of $0.21 plus five basis points of the transaction. A debit card issuer that adopts certain fraud prevention procedures may charge an additional $0.01 per transaction. Becoming subject to the Durbin Amendment has negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect our debit card related fee income and pre-tax earnings.\nRISK RELATED TO RISK MANAGEMENT\nWe are exposed to risks related to fraud and cyber-attacks.\nThe Company is continuously enhancing and expanding our digital products and services to meet client and business needs with desired outcomes. These digital products and services often include storing, transmitting, and processing confidential client, employee, monetary, and business information. Due to the nature of this information, and the value it has for internal and external threat actors, we, and our third-party service providers, continue to be subject to cyber-attacks and fraud activity that attempts to gain unauthorized access, misuse information and information systems, steal information, disrupt or degrade information systems, spread malicious software, and other illegal activities.\nWe believe we have robust preventive, detective, and administrative safeguards and security controls to minimize the probability and magnitude of a material event. However, because the tactics and techniques used by threat actors to bypass safeguards and security controls change frequently, and often are not recognized until after an event has occurred, we may be unable to anticipate future tactics and techniques, or to implement adequate and timely protective measures.\nCybersecurity, and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes, and practices designed to protect client information, systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Company. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance, modify, and refine our protective measures against these evolving threats.\nTo date, we have no knowledge of a successful cyber-attack or other material information security breach affecting our systems. However, our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the continuation of a remote work environment for our employees and service providers and our plans to continue to implement and expand digital banking services, expand operations, and use third-party information systems that includes cloud-based infrastructure, platforms, and software. Recent instances of attacks specifically targeting financial services businesses indicate that the risk to our systems remains significant. If we or a critical third-party vendor were to experience a cyber-attack or information security breach, we could suffer damage to our reputation, productivity losses, response costs associated with investigation and resumption of services, and incur substantial additional expenses, including remediation expenses costs associated with client notification and credit monitoring services, increased insurance premiums, regulatory penalties and fines, and costs associated civil litigation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s clients and vendors rely on technology and systems unmanaged by the Company, such as networking devices, server infrastructure, personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices, to contact and conduct business with the Company. If the devices of the Company\u2019s clients or vendors become the target of a cyber-attack, or information security breach, it could result in unauthorized access to, misuse of, or loss of confidential client, employee, monetary, or business information. Threat actors using\nimproperly obtained personal or financial information of consumers can attempt to obtain loans, lines of credit, or other financial products from the Company, or attempt to fraudulently persuade the Company\u2019s employees, clients, or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose confidential information in order to gain improper access to the Company\u2019s information and information systems.\nWe also face additional costs when our customers become the victims of cyber-attacks. For example, various retailers have reported that they have been the victims of a cyber-attack in which large amounts of their clients\u2019 data, including debit and credit card information, is obtained. Our clients may be the victims of phishing scams, providing cyber criminals access to their accounts, or credit or debit card information. In these situations, we incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our clients.\nBoth internal and external fraud and theft are risks. If confidential client, employee, monetary, or business information were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or if such information were to be intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties, or if our own employees abused their access to financial systems to commit fraud against our clients and the Company. These activities can occur in connection with the origination of loans and lines of credit, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, and checking transactions, and result in financial losses, as well as reputational damage.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability for us to operate our business, additional costs to correct defects, potential liability to clients, reputational intervention, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely on certain third parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections, telecommunications, and network access. Even though we have a vendor risk management program to help us carefully select and monitor the performance of third parties, we do not control their actions. The failure of a third-party to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements as a result of changes in the third-party\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, strategic focus, system interruption or breaches, or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Replacing these third parties could also create significant delays and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties introduces additional risks to our business operations.\nA natural disaster or recurring energy shortage, especially in California could harm our business.\nWe are based in Irvine, California and, at December 31, 2021, approximately 61% of the aggregate outstanding principal of our loans was tied to businesses or secured by real estate located in California. In addition, the computer systems that operate our internal computer network, our internet websites, and some of their back-up systems are located in Irvine, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. Historically, California has been vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods, mudslides, and droughts. Certain of these natural disasters may be exacerbated by changing climate conditions.\nNatural or man-made disasters and severe weather events may cause operational disruptions and damage to both our properties and properties securing our loans. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our information technology structure and websites, which could prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans, and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial, and management information systems. The measures we implemented to mitigate the risk of business interruption from natural\ndisasters may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster. A natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets, our loan portfolio. Uninsured or underinsured disasters may reduce borrowers\u2019 ability to repay mortgage loans. Disasters or recurring power outages may diminish the profitability of our business customers and reduce their ability to repay business loans. Disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing our loans, impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through foreclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. California has also experienced energy and water shortages, which, if they recur, could impair the value of the real estate or hinder the operations of businesses, including agricultural businesses, in those areas affected. The occurrence of natural disasters or energy shortages in California could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nClimate change could have a material negative impact on the Company and clients.\nThe Company\u2019s business, as well as the operations and activities of our clients, could be negatively impacted by climate change. Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to the Company and its clients, and these risks are expected to increase over time. Climate change presents multi-faceted risks, including: operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on the Company and its clients\u2019 facilities and other assets\u037e credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk\u037e transition risks associated with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy\u037e and reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about our practices related to climate change, the Company\u2019s carbon footprint, and the Company\u2019s business relationships with clients who operate in carbon-intensive industries.\nFederal and state banking regulators and supervisory authorities, investors, and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their clients, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities. Given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector, either via disruptions in economic activity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies as the economy transitions to a less carbon-intensive environment, the Company may face regulatory risk of increasing focus on the Company\u2019s resilience to climate-related risks, including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit, and reputational risks and costs.\nWith the increased importance and focus on climate change, we are making efforts to enhance our governance of climate change-related risks and integrate climate considerations into our risk governance framework. Nonetheless, the risks associated with climate change are rapidly changing and evolving in an escalating fashion, making them difficult to assess due to limited data and other uncertainties. We could experience increased expenses resulting from strategic planning, litigation, and technology and market changes, and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to our response to climate change and our climate change strategy, which, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC GROWTH\nAcquisitions may disrupt our business.\nWe have consummated eleven acquisitions since 2010. Most recently on June 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Opus, a California state-chartered bank with approximately $8 billion in total assets. The success of the Opus acquisition or any future acquisition we may consummate will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize the anticipated revenue enhancements and efficiencies and to combine our business with the business of the target institution in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of either institution, or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers, and that permits growth\nopportunities to occur. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the subject acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nIt is possible that the integration process associated with any pending or future acquisition could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. Integration efforts could also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the combined Company.\nAcquisitions involve numerous other risks and uncertainties, including inaccurate financial and operational assumptions, incomplete or failed due diligence, lower-than-expected performance, higher-than-expected costs, adverse market or other stakeholder reactions, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties, the potential loss of key personnel, and the possibility of litigation and other disputes.\nAcquisitions may dilute stockholder value.\nThe acquisition of Opus on June 1, 2020 was an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $749.6 million as of the date of close. The consideration payable to Opus stockholders upon consummation of the acquisition consisted of whole shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock. We issued approximately 34.4 million shares of common stock to Opus stockholders in connection with the acquisition, and the transaction resulted in initial tangible book value dilution of 2.8%, or $0.53 per share at the time of closing with an earnback period of 1.8 years. Future mergers or acquisitions, if any, may involve cash, debt or equity securities as transaction consideration. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our stock\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. We cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to consummate, or if consummated, successfully integrate any future acquisitions, or that we will not incur disruptions or unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from pending or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the value of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\nWhen the Company acquires a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $970.9 million of goodwill and intangible assets, which includes goodwill of approximately $901.3 million resulting from the acquisitions the Company has consummated since 2011. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which requires goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually, at the reporting unit level, or more frequently if events and circumstances lead management to believe the value of goodwill may be impaired. GAAP also requires that intangible assets other than goodwill be tested for impairment when events and circumstances change, indicating that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. A quantitative assessment is followed to determine the amount of impairment in the event the carrying value of such assets are deemed not recoverable. Impairment is measured as the amount by which their carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value.\nIn testing goodwill for impairment, GAAP allows the Company to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of those assets are impaired. The Company\u2019s qualitative assessment considers known positive and negative, as well as any mitigating events and circumstances associated with each relevant factor that may be deemed to have an impact on the value of the Company. Such factors may\ninclude various relevant economic, industry, market and company specific factors that may have an impact on the value of the Company. Should the Company\u2019s qualitative assessment indicate the value of goodwill and intangible assets could be impaired, a quantitative assessment is then performed to determine whether there is impairment. However, GAAP also allows the Company, at its option, to unconditionally forego the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative assessment. This assessment involves determining the fair value of the reporting unit (which in our case is the Company) and comparing that determination of fair value to the carrying value of the Company in order to quantify the amount of possible impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value, the Company would then recognize the amount of impairment as the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. Changes in the local and national economy, the federal and state legislative and regulatory environments for financial institutions, the stock market, interest rates, and other external factors (such as natural disasters, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or significant world events) may occur from time to time, often with great unpredictability, and may materially impact the fair value of publicly traded financial institutions and result in a goodwill impairment charge at a future date. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill or intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success.\nOur employees are our most important resource. Competition for qualified personnel is intense in many areas of the financial services industry and has increased significantly since the onset of the pandemic. We endeavor to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees to assist in executing our growth, acquisition, and business strategies. We also seek to retain proven, experienced senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time to time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession of our executive management team. Losses of or changes in our current executive officers or other key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry has become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and continued banking consolidation, which may increase in connection with current economic, market, and political conditions. We face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of competitors, including national banks, regional banks, community banks and, more recently, financial technology (or \"fintech\") companies. Many of our competitors offer the same banking services that we offer and our success depends on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards. In addition to product and service offerings, we compete on a number of other factors, including financial and other terms, underwriting standards, technological capabilities, brand, and reputation. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced new loan production and/or decreased deposit balances or less favorable terms on loans and leases and/or deposit accounts. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including without limitation, nonbank specialty lenders, insurance companies, private investment funds, investment banks, and other financial intermediaries. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources, established customer bases, more locations, and longer operating histories. Should competition in the financial services industry intensify, our ability to market our products and services may be adversely affected. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to grow or maintain the levels of our loans and deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry experiences continuous technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors, however, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements or are technology focused start-ups with internally developed cloud-native systems that offer improved user interfaces and experiences. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, we depend on internal and outsourced technology to support all aspects of our business operations. Interruption or failure of these systems creates a risk of business loss as a result of adverse customer experiences and possible diminishing of our reputation, damage claims or civil fines. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry or to successfully implement core processing strategies could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational errors can include information system misconfiguration, clerical or record-keeping errors, or disruptions from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Because of the Company\u2019s large transaction volume and its necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process these transactions, there is a risk that technical flaws, tampering, or manipulation of those automated systems, arising from events wholly or partially beyond its control, may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are exposed to the risk that our business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RISKS\nWe are subject to liquidity risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. Although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions, an inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investment securities and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market disruption, a decrease in the borrowing capacity assigned to our pledged assets by our secured creditors, or adverse regulatory action against us. Deterioration in economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of liquidity, including, but not limited to, inter-bank borrowings and borrowings from the Federal Reserve and FHLB. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally as a result of conditions faced by banking organizations in the domestic and international credit markets.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe are required by federal and state regulators to maintain adequate levels of capital. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to meet regulatory or other internal requirements. As a publicly traded company, a likely source of additional funds is the capital markets, accomplished generally through the issuance of equity, both common and preferred stock, and the issuance of debt. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend\non, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that access to such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers or counter-parties participating in the capital markets, may materially and adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. The inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy standards, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe Corporation and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as making payments on certain capital instruments, paying executive bonuses or dividends, and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.\nRISKS FROM ACCOUNTING AND OTHER ESTIMATES\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nWe have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Material estimates subject to change in the near term include, among other items, the allowance for credit losses, particularly in light of the adoption of the new CECL standard on January 1, 2020; the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets; the fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities; and the realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any adjustment may be significant.\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. We use models in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating model output could be adversely affected due to the inaccuracy of that information. Models are often based on historical experience to predict future outcomes, as a result new experiences or events which are not part of historical experience can significantly increase model imprecision and impact model reliability. Model inputs can also include information provided by third parties, such as economic forecasts or macroeconomic variables (unemployment rates, real GDP etc.) upon which we rely. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions, could be affected due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient, which could have a negative impact on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases. Our reliance on models continues to increase as rules, guidance, and expectations change. The most recent example of this is the additional models used in the determination of our ACL under CECL, which we adopted on January 1, 2020.\nRISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN OUR SECURITIES\nDividends from the Bank are a primary source of the Corporation\u2019s liquidity from which, among other things, dividends to stockholders may be paid.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders is partially dependent upon receiving dividends from the Bank. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us is subject to restrictions set forth in the Financial Code. The Financial Code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its stockholders in excess of the lesser of (1) a bank\u2019s retained earnings and (2) a bank\u2019s net income for its last three fiscal years, less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority-owned subsidiary of the bank to the stockholders of the bank during such period. However, a bank may, with the approval of the DFPI, make a distribution to its stockholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (a) its retained earnings; (b) its net income for its last fiscal year; or (c) its net income for its current fiscal year. In the event that banking regulators determine that the stockholders\u2019 equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound, the regulators may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution.\nApproval of the Federal Reserve is required for payment of any dividend by a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, such as the Bank, if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits without regulatory and stockholder approval. The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends from the Bank to the Corporation could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nWe may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends on, or repurchases of, our common stock.\nOur stockholders are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. In addition, in January 2021, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 4,725,000 shares of our common stock. We are not required to pay dividends on, or effect repurchases of, our common stock and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend and/or share repurchase program in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in Delaware law, by the Federal Reserve, and by certain covenants contained in our subordinated debentures. Notification to the Federal Reserve is also required prior to our declaring and paying a cash dividend to our stockholders during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. We may not pay a dividend if the Federal Reserve objects or until such time as we receive approval from the Federal Reserve or we no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. In addition, we may be restricted by applicable law or regulation or actions taken by our regulators, now or in the future, from paying dividends to, or repurchasing shares of our common stock from, our stockholders. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue paying dividends on, or repurchase shares of, our common stock at current levels or at all. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends on our common stock or our share repurchase program could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85020, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PPBI"}
