{"cik": "1684144", "company": "Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Factors\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a limited operating history, are not profitable and may never become profitable.\nWe are a development stage veterinary diagnostic and pharmaceutical company creating products for companion animals (canine, feline and equine) by focusing on the unmet needs of clinical veterinarians. Since the commencement of our business in May 2015, our operations have been primarily limited to the identification of product candidates and research and development of our diagnostic and drug product candidates. As a result, we have limited historical operations upon which to evaluate our business and prospects and we have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain approval for any of our product candidates or successfully overcome the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in emerging fields such as the companion animal pharmaceuticals and health care solutions industries.\nWe also have not generated any revenue to date, and we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs and other expenses. Our net loss and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $19,784,054 and $16,647,687, respectively. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2019 was $52,057,841. As of December 31, 2019, we had total shareholders' equity of $2,095,459. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which will increase significantly from historical levels as we expand our product development activities (including conducting required clinical studies and trials), seek necessary approvals for our product candidates, and begin commercialization activities. Even if we succeed in developing and broadly commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or cease operations.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to achieve our goals.\nWe do not have any products approved for sale. Although we believe that we do not require pre-market approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine, or the FDA-CVM, to market and sell TRUMFORMATM , a Bulk Acoustic Wave sensor-based veterinary point-of-care diagnostic platform for performing immunodiagnostic testing, ZM-020, our Raman spectroscopy-based point-of-care diagnostic platform, nor ZM-017 and ZM-022, our circulating tumor cell, or CTC, diagnostic assay that we are developing, we do not expect to commence marketing of TRUMFORMATM the second half of 2020.\nUntil, and unless, we receive approval from the FDA-CVM for our drug product candidates, we cannot market or sell our drug products in the United States and will have no material drug product revenue. Our lead drug product candidates are in the formulation, optimization and/or pilot study stage, and we have not yet begun pivotal trials. We anticipate that each of our drug product candidates will require approximately five years of development at a cost of approximately $6 million per drug product candidate before we expect to be able to apply for marketing approval in the United States. In addition, certain assays that we may choose to pursue for use in our diagnostic platforms may require pre-market regulatory approval.\nWe are also seeking to identify potential complementary opportunities in the veterinary diagnostics and therapeutics sectors. We will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to develop our existing product candidates and any other product candidates that we may develop or acquire. These expenditures will include: costs of developing and validating our diagnostic product candidates and related assays and consumables; costs associated with drug formulation; costs associated with conducting pilot and pivotal trials and clinical studies; costs associated with completing other research and development activities; costs of identifying additional potential product candidates; costs associated with payments to technology licensors and maintaining other intellectual property; costs of obtaining regulatory approvals; costs associated with securing contract manufacturers to meet our commercial manufacturing and supply capabilities; and costs associated with marketing and selling our products. In addition, under our existing development agreements, we are required make significant cash milestone payments to our development partners and to pay certain development costs. We do not control the timing of these payments. We also may incur unanticipated costs. Because the outcome of our development activities and commercialization efforts is inherently uncertain, the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our existing or future product candidates may be greater or less than we anticipate.\nAs a result, we will need to obtain additional capital to fund the development of our business. Except for our $5,000,000 unsecured working capital loan we have no existing agreements or arrangements with respect to any financings, and any such financings may result in dilution to our shareholders, the imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business or the value of our common shares.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our existing or future diagnostics and product candidates;\n\u00b7 the extent to which any of our future diagnostic assays may be subject to USDA-CVB pre-market regulation;\n\u00b7 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our existing or future diagnostics or product candidates;\n\u00b7 the number and characteristics of the diagnostics and/or product candidates we pursue;\n\u00b7 the cost of contract manufacturers to manufacture our existing and future diagnostics and product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize;\n\u00b7 the cost of commercialization activities if any of our existing or future diagnostics and product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u00b7 the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u00b7 the costs associated with being a public company;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; and\n\u00b7 the costs involved in preparing and filing patent applications, maintaining any successfully obtained patents and protecting and enforcing any such patents.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate one or more of our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nThe audit opinion on our financial statements contains a going concern modification.\nAs a result of our recurring losses from operations and our accumulated deficit, the opinion of our independent registered public accountants on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 contains a going concern modification. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we might have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. In addition, the inclusion of a going concern modification by our independent registered public accountants, our recurring losses, our accumulated deficit and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital or to enter into contractual relationships with third parties.\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidates and cannot be certain that any of them will be approved for marketing, to the extent applicable, or successfully commercialized.\nWe have no products approved for sale in any jurisdiction and are focused primarily on the development of our lead diagnostic candidates. Accordingly, our near-term prospects, including our ability to generate material product revenue, or enter into potential strategic transactions, will depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of one or more of our lead candidates, which in turn will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 the successful completion of clinical validation of our diagnostic product candidates, which may take significantly longer than we anticipate and will depend, in part, upon the satisfactory performance of our strategic partners and third-party contractors;\n\u00b7 the ability of our third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture supplies of any of our product candidates and to develop, validate and maintain viable commercial manufacturing processes that are compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices or GMP;\n\u00b7 our ability to successfully market any product candidate for which marketing approval is received, whether alone or in partnership with others;\n\u00b7 the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of our product candidates compared to alternative and competing treatments;\n\u00b7 the acceptance of our product candidates as safe and effective by veterinarians, pet owners and the animal health community;\n\u00b7 our ability to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our business; and\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain and enforce our intellectual property rights and obtain marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, and avoid or prevail in any third-party patent interference, patent infringement claims or administrative patent proceedings initiated by third parties or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d).\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing or commercializing any of our product candidates. If we are unsuccessful or are significantly delayed in developing and commercializing our product candidates, our business and prospects will be materially adversely affected, and you may lose all or a portion of your investment.\nWe face unproven markets for our products candidates.\nThe companion animal therapeutic and diagnostic markets are less developed than the human therapeutic and diagnostic markets and as a result no assurance can be given that our product candidates will be successful. Veterinarians, pet owners or other veterinary health providers in general may not accept or utilize any products that we may develop.\nThe companion animal care industry is subject to rapidly changing technology, which could make our product candidates obsolete.\nThe companion animal care industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards, all of which could make our product candidates obsolete. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis and to pursue new market opportunities that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances. We must continuously enhance our product offerings to keep pace with evolving standards of care. If we do not update our product offerings to reflect new scientific knowledge or new standards of care, our product candidates could become obsolete, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully develop and commercialize our existing and any future product candidates will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to convince the veterinary community of the clinical utility of our products and their potential advantages over existing tests and therapies;\n\u00b7 the willingness or ability by pet owners to pay for our products and the willingness of veterinarians to recommend our products;\n\u00b7 the willingness of veterinarians to utilize our diagnostic tests; and\n\u00b7 where applicable, the willingness of testing labs to buy our assay equipment.\nOur dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide components in our product candidates, manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves. Because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations. The risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with third-party suppliers on reasonable terms, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of supplier facilities, supplier work stoppages and suppliers\u2019 failure to comply with applicable regulations or their contractual obligations. Problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to complete development, supply the market, lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers.\nIn addition, we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. To mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers, we will seek when possible to enter into long-term contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, some suppliers may decline to enter into long-term contracts, and we are required to purchase products with short term contracts or on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products, that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations, and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe commercial potential of our product candidates is difficult to predict. The market for any product candidate, or for companion animal diagnostics and therapeutics overall, is uncertain and may be smaller than we anticipate, which could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe believe that the emerging nature of our industry and our unproven business plan make it difficult to estimate the commercial potential of any of our product candidates. The market for any product that we seek to commercialize will depend on important factors such as the cost, utility and ease of use of our diagnostic assays, the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates compared to other available treatments, including potentially less expensive human pharmaceutical alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, preferences of veterinarians, the willingness of pet owners to pay for such products, and the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the product development process or after commercial introduction. If the market potential for our product candidates is less than we anticipate due to one or more of these factors, it could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the willingness of pet owners to pay for our product candidates, if approved, may be less than we anticipate, and may be negatively affected by overall economic conditions. Because relatively few pet owners purchase insurance for their companion animals, pet owners are more likely to have to pay for our products directly and may be unwilling or unable to pay for any such products.\nWe face competition from the validated human drugs from which our drug candidates are developed which are not subject to patent protection and which are already used \u201coff-label\u201d in animals.\nOur lead drug product candidates include APIs already demonstrated safe and effective in humans and we expect that our future drug product candidates will be similarly based on such APIs. We do not engage in research or discovery of novel therapeutics but focus on drug product candidates with APIs that have been successfully commercialized or demonstrated to be safe and effective in humans, which we sometimes refer to as validated. We expect that there will be little, if any, third-party patent protection of the APIs in our drug product candidates. As a result, our drug product candidates may face competition from their human equivalents in situations where such equivalents are available and used in unapproved animal indications, which is known as off-label use. There is no assurance that the eventual prices of our drug products will be lower than or competitive with the prices of the human equivalents used off-label, or that a palatable, easy-to-administer formulation will be sufficient to differentiate them from their human equivalents.\nOur product candidates will face significant competition and may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe development and commercialization of veterinary diagnostics and pharmaceuticals is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete effectively with other products in the market and identify potential partners for continued development and commercialization.\nThere are a number of competitors in the diagnostic market that have substantially greater financial and operational resources and established marketing, sales and service organizations. We expect to compete primarily with commercial clinical laboratories, hospitals\u2019 clinical laboratories and other veterinary diagnostic equipment manufacturers. Our principal competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Inc., Abaxis, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoetis Inc., Heska Corporation and Zoetis Inc. We must develop our distribution channels and build our direct sales force in order to compete effectively in these markets. If we are unable to effectively manage our distribution channels in our highly competitive industry, we may fail to retain customers or obtain new customers and our business will suffer.\nIf our drug product candidates are approved, we expect to compete with large animal health companies including Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck &Co., Inc.; Elanco Animal Health Incorporated; Bayer Animal Health, the animal health division of Bayer AG; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, the animal health business unit of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; and Zoetis Inc., as well as European companies such as Virbac S.A., Vetoquinol S.A. and Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC We are also aware of several smaller early stage companies that are developing products for use in the pet therapeutics market, including Kindred Biosciences, Inc., Aratana Therapeutics, Inc., . (a wholly owned subsidiary of Elanco Animal Health as of July 2019), Parnell Pharmaceuticals Holdings Ltd. and Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. We also expect to compete with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the field of animal health medicines.\nWe target drug product candidates for which the API, while having been approved for use in human drugs, has not been previously approved for use in animals. If we are the first to gain approval for the use of such API in animals, our drug products will benefit from between three and seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States for the approved indication. We also plan to differentiate our products, where possible, with alternative drug delivery systems that are more conducive to dosing for the target companion animal species, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent our competitors from developing substantially similar products and bringing those products to market earlier than we are able to.\nOur drug product candidates will face competition from various products approved for use in humans that are used off-label in animals, and all our products will face potential competition from new products in development. These and other potential competing products may benefit from greater brand recognition and brand loyalty than our drug product candidates may achieve.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially more financial, technical and human resources than we do. Many also have far more experience than we have in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal health medicines, including pet therapeutics. We also expect to compete with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the fields of animal diagnostics and animal health. If such competing products are commercialized prior to our product candidates, or if our intellectual property protection and efforts to obtain regulatory exclusivity fail to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our therapeutic products, we may be unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we participate. Contractual agreements between clinics and from competitors may limit practices\u2019 ability to use other tests and technologies due to predetermined minimums in those agreements.\nOur ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize our drug product candidates is dependent on our establishing and maintaining relationships with GMP-compliant third-party manufacturers.\nWe have no internal manufacturing capabilities and we do not plan to develop such capabilities. As a result, our ability to manufacture and commercialize our product candidates is substantially dependent on our ability to ensure a dependable and high-quality supply of the APIs required for our pilot studies and pivotal trials and for future commercial manufacturing. We currently believe that, because the APIs used in our drug product candidates have been used in human drugs, there are multiple GMP-compliant manufacturers available that will be able to supply these APIs and that the contract manufacturers we currently use for our trial supplies will be able to provide commercial supplies of any of our drug product candidates. While we have historically been able to obtain the necessary supplies of our APIs for our development work, we cannot be certain that either we or our contract manufacturers will continue to be able to provide the necessary API supply. Neither we nor our contract manufacturers have long-term supply contracts with API manufacturers, and we have no agreements in place for the commercial-scale supply of any API or the manufacture of any of our drug product candidates. If we are unable to procure the requisite apply of an API or to contract with a GMP-complaint third-party manufacturer, we may be unable to continue to develop, manufacture or commercialize any of our product candidates and our business may fail to grow or develop.\nThe results of earlier studies may not be predictive of the results of our pivotal trials, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our existing or future diagnostic or drug product candidates under applicable regulatory requirements or maintain any regulatory approval obtained. The denial, delay or loss of any regulatory approval would prevent or delay our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation. We will not be permitted to market our drug product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of a New Animal Drug Application, or NADA, from the FDA-CVM and may not be able to market and sell any point-of-care diagnostic products without pre-marketing approval from the USDA-CVB. To gain approval to market a pet pharmaceutical or point-of-care diagnostic product kit for a particular species, we must provide the FDA-CVM or the USDA-CVB, as applicable, with efficacy data from pivotal trials that adequately demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective in the target species for the intended indications. In addition, we must provide manufacturing data. For the FDA-CVM, we must provide data from safety testing and clinical data, also called target animal safety studies. Similarly, for the USDA-CVB, we must provide the results of specific tests required to be conducted in accordance with the USDA-CVB\u2019s guidelines demonstrating the sensitivity/specificity, reproducibility/repeatability/suitability and the ruggedness or robustness of the relevant diagnostic kit. Either of the FDA-CVM or the USDA-CVB may also require us to conduct costly post-approval testing and/or collect post-approval safety data to maintain our approval for any product candidate or diagnostic. The results of our pivotal studies and other initial development activities, and the results of any previous studies in humans or animals conducted by us or third parties, may not be predictive of future results of pivotal trials or other future studies, and failure can occur at any time during or after pivotal studies and other development activities by us or our contract research organizations or CROs. Our pivotal studies may fail to show the desired safety or efficacy of our product candidates despite promising initial data or the results in previous human or animal studies conducted by others, and the success of a product candidate in prior animal studies, or in the treatment of human beings, does not ensure success in subsequent studies. Clinical trials in humans and pivotal trials in animals sometimes fail to show a benefit even for drugs that are effective, because of statistical limitations in the design of the trials or other statistical anomalies. Therefore, even if our studies and other development activities are completed as planned, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nThe FDA-CVM or the USDA-CVB can delay, limit, deny or revoke approval of any of our product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u2022 if the FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB disagrees with our interpretation of data from our pivotal studies or other development efforts;\n\u2022 if we are unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA-CVM or the USDA-CVB that the product candidate is safe and effective for the target indication;\n\u2022 if the FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB requires additional studies or changes its approval policies or regulations;\n\u2022 if the FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB does not approve of the formulation, labeling or the specifications of our existing and future product candidates;\n\u2022 if the FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB fails to approve the manufacturing processes of our third-party contract manufacturers; and\n\u2022 if any approved product candidate subsequently fails post-approval testing required by the FDA-CVM or the USDA-CVB.\nFurther, even if we receive approval of our product candidates, such approval may be for a more limited indication than we originally requested, the FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates and we may be required to conduct costly post-approval testing. Any delay or failure in obtaining applicable regulatory approval for the intended indications of our product candidates would delay or prevent commercialization of such product candidates and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nDevelopment of product candidates for use in companion animal health is an inherently expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and any delay or discontinuance of validation or pivotal studies for our current or future product candidates would significantly harm our business and prospects.\nDevelopment of product candidates for use in companion animals is an inherently lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and there is no assurance that our development activities will be successful. We do not know whether the validation studies or the pivotal studies of our drug product candidates, will begin or conclude on time, and they may be delayed or discontinued for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to:\n\u2022 address any safety concerns that arise during the course of the studies;\n\u2022 complete the studies due to deviations from the study protocols, the occurrence of adverse events or, in the case of our validation studies, sensitivity and selectivity results that vary from our expectations;\n\u2022 add new study sites;\n\u2022 address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations; or\n\u2022 reach agreement on acceptable terms with study sites, which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different sites.\nAny delays in completing our development efforts will increase our costs, delay our product candidate development and any regulatory approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, factors that may cause a delay in the commencement or completion of our development efforts may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates which, as described above, would materially, adversely impact our business and prospects.\nOur strategic partnerships are important to our business. If we are unable to maintain any of these partnerships, or if these partnerships are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into a number of strategic partnerships that are important to our business and we expect to enter into similar partnerships as part of our growth strategy. These partnerships may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 partners may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these partnerships;\n\u2022 partners may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022 partners may not pursue development of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development based on development results, changes in the partners\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022 partners could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the partners believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours, which may cause partners to cease to devote resources to the development of our product candidates;\n\u2022 disagreements with partners, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research and development of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022 partners may not properly maintain or defend their intellectual property rights or may use proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate the intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022 partners may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022 partners may learn about our technology and use this knowledge to compete with us in the future;\n\u2022 there may be conflicts between different partners that could negatively affect those partnerships and potentially others; and\n\u2022 the number and type of our partnerships could adversely affect our attractiveness to future partners or acquirers.\nIf any partnerships we enter into do not result in the successful development of our product candidates or if one of our partners terminates its agreement with us, we may not be able to successfully develop our product candidates, our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop additional product candidates. All of the risks relating to our product development, regulatory approval and commercialization also apply to the activities of our partners and there can be no assurance that our partnerships will produce positive results or successful products on a timely basis or at all.\nAdditionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if a partner of ours is involved in a business combination or otherwise changes its business priorities, the partner might deemphasize or terminate the development of any technology licensed to it by us. If one of our partners terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new partners and our perception in the business and financial communities and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nWe may in the future determine to partner with additional pharmaceutical and technology companies for development of additional product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for partnership will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed partnership and the proposed partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable partners on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to access technologies that are important for the future development of our business. If we elect to fund and undertake development activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into partnerships and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of our partnership arrangements, we are required to make significant milestone and other payments to our strategic partners. The timing of any such payments is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. If we are not able to make such payments when due, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a development and supply agreement with Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC, or Qorvo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Qorvo, Inc. Under this agreement, Qorvo is responsible for the development of certain assay cartridges and the related instrument. We agreed to pay the associated non-recurring engineering costs of up to $500,000 per assay cartridge and the instrument and are responsible for the validation of the assay cartridges and the instrument. Under the terms of this agreement, we are required to pay Qorvo additional milestone payments in cash or, if elected by Qorvo, additional unregistered common shares having a value calculated as specified in the agreement. The total amount of additional milestone payments (if all milestones are met) will be $10 million (if paid entirely with cash) or up to $10.9 million (consisting of cash in the amount of $7 million and unregistered common shares having a value of $3.9 million, if Qorvo elects to receive compensation partially in equity). At December 31, 2018, $5 million of milestone payment have been paid in cash. Total remaining milestone payments will be $5 million if paid entirely in cash, or $3.5 million in cash and $1.95 in unregistered common shares, if elected.\nIn May 2018, we entered into a development, commercialization and exclusive distribution agreement with Seraph Biosciences, Inc., or Seraph. Under this agreement, we are responsible for development and validation, and their associated costs. Seraph is entitled to additional payments for development costs. Seraph will be entitled to receive up to an additional $7,000,000, payable 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in additional unregistered common shares, upon the achievement of a series of staged, specified milestones, including completion of laboratory studies and field studies, production and commercial shipment of products. In addition, we have agreed to pay Seraph license fees based on a percentage of gross profit from commercial sales of ZM-020. At December 31, 2019, all milestone payments remain unpaid.\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct certain portions of our development activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have used contract manufacturing organizations (\u201cCMOs\u201d) and contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to conduct our manufacturing and research and development activities. We expect to continue to do so, including with respect to our manufacturing, clinical validation, pilot studies and pivotal trials of our diagnostic and therapeutic product candidates. These CMOs and CROs are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs or manage the risks associated with their activities on our behalf. We are responsible to regulatory authorities for ensuring that each of our product candidates is manufactured using good manufacturing practices and studies are conducted in accordance with the development plans and trial protocols, and any failure by our CMOs and CROs to do so may adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, subject us to penalties, or harm our credibility with regulators. The FDA-CVM also requires us and our CMOs and CROs to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good manufacturing practices, or GMPs, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and good laboratory practices, or GLPs, collectively called GXPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of our manufacturing and studies to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate.\nOur agreements with our CMOs and CROs may allow termination by the CMOs and CROs in certain circumstances with little or no advance notice to us. These agreements generally will require our CMOs and CROs to reasonably cooperate with us at our expense for an orderly winding down of the CMOs\u2019 and CROs\u2019 services under the agreements. If the CMOs and CROs conducting our manufacturing and studies do not comply with their contractual duties or obligations to us, or if they experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our development protocols or GXPs or for any other reason, we may need to secure new arrangements with alternative CMOs and CROs, which could be difficult and costly. In such event, our studies also may need to be extended, delayed or terminated as a result, or may need to be repeated. If any of the foregoing were to occur, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed, and we may be required to expend substantial additional resources.\nThe failure of any CMO and CRO to perform adequately or the termination of any arrangements with any of them may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates. If we experience problems with any of these suppliers, the manufacturing of our product candidates or products could be delayed.\nWe do not have the capability to manufacture our product candidates and do not intend to develop that capability. As a result, we rely on CMOs to produce our product candidates. We expect to enter into contracts with CMOs for the commercial scale production of the products we intend to commercialize. Reliance on CMOs involves risks, including:\n\u2022 the inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n\u2022 inability to access production facilities on a timely basis;\n\u2022 inability or delay in increasing manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022 manufacturing and product quality issues related to the scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u2022 costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for commercial level activity;\n\u2022 a failure to satisfy any applicable FDA-CVM cGMP requirements on a consistent basis;\n\u2022 the inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022 termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u2022 the reliance on a single source of supply which, if unavailable, would delay our ability to complete the development and testing and commercialization of our products;\n\u2022 the lack of qualified backup suppliers for supplies that are currently purchased from a single source supplier;\n\u2022 operations of our CMOs or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the CMO or supplier;\n\u2022 carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control; and\n\u2022 the failure to deliver products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.\nAny of these risks could cause the delay of validation studies, clinical trials, regulatory submissions, the receipt of any required approvals or the commercialization of our products, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our product candidates successfully. Manufacturing of our product candidates and any approved products subject to cGMP could be disrupted or halted if our CMOs do not comply with cGMP, even if the compliance failure does not relate to our product candidates or approved products. Furthermore, if our CMOs fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and could lose potential revenue. It may take several years to establish an alternative source of supply for our product candidates and to have any such new source approved by the FDA-CVM in the event that such approval is required.\nEven if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success.\nEven if we obtain FDA-CVM, USDA-CVB or other regulatory approvals, our product candidates may not achieve market acceptance among veterinarians and pet owners and may not be commercially successful. Market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the safety of our products as demonstrated in our target animal studies;\n\u2022 the indications for which our products are approved;\n\u2022 the acceptance by veterinarians and pet owners of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022 the proper training and administration or use of our products by veterinarians;\n\u2022 the potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments or diagnostics, including products approved for use by humans that are used off label;\n\u2022 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for our products, if approved, on the part of veterinarians and pet owners;\n\u2022 the willingness of pet owners to pay for our treatments, relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times;\n\u2022 the relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our approved products fail to achieve market acceptance or commercial success, our business could fail and you could lose your entire investment.\nPharmaceuticals for companion animals, like human pharmaceuticals, are subject to unanticipated post-approval safety or efficacy concerns, which may harm our business and reputation.\nThe success of our commercialization efforts will depend upon the perceived safety and effectiveness of pharmaceuticals for companion animals, in general, and of our products, in particular. Unanticipated safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to approved therapeutics after they enter into commerce, which may result in product recalls or withdrawals or suspension of sales, as well as product liability and other claims. It is also possible that the occurrence of significant adverse side effects in approved human compounds upon which our drug product candidates are based could impact our products. Any safety or efficacy concerns, or recalls, withdrawals or suspensions of sales of our products or other pet therapeutics, or of their human equivalents, could harm our reputation, in particular, or pet therapeutics, generally, and materially, adversely affect our business and prospects or the potential growth of the pet therapeutics industry, regardless of whether such concerns or actions are justified.\nChanges in the distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share, margins and distribution of our products.\nIn most markets, pet owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. In recent years, pet owners have increasingly been afforded the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians, such as Internet-based retailers, \u201cbig-box\u201d retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. Pet owners also could decrease their reliance on, and visits to, veterinarians as they rely more on Internet-based animal health information. Since we intend to market our products through the veterinarian distribution channel, any decrease in visits to veterinarians by pet owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, pet owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.\nWe do not currently carry liability insurance; however, as we continue our development and commercialization activities, future federal and state legislation may result in increased exposure to product liability claims, which could result in substantial losses to us.\nWe do not currently carry any product liability insurance. Under existing federal and state laws, companion animals are generally considered to be the personal property of their owners and, as such, pet owners\u2019 recovery for product liability claims involving their companion animals may be limited to the replacement value of the animals. Pet owners and their advocates, however, have filed lawsuits from time to time seeking non-economic damages such as pain and suffering and emotional distress for harm to their companion animals based on theories applicable to personal injuries to humans. If new legislation is passed to allow recovery for such non-economic damages, or if precedents are set allowing for such recovery, we could be exposed to increased product liability claims that could result in substantial losses to us if successful. We do not currently have product liability insurance and we may not be able to obtain or maintain this type of insurance in the future.\nIf we are unable to establish sales capabilities on our own or through third parties, we may not be able to market and sell our existing or future product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nWe do not currently have a fully staffed sales organization. We intend to commercialize any product candidate for which we received regulatory approval in the United States with a direct sales force and through third-party distributors. To achieve this, we will be required to build a direct sales organization and to establish relationships with distributors of veterinary products. We also will have to build our marketing, sales, managerial and other non-technical capabilities and make arrangements with third parties for distribution and to perform certain of these other services, and we may not be successful in doing so. Building an internal sales organization is time consuming and expensive and will significantly increase our compensation expense. We may be unable to secure third-party distribution contracts with distributors on favorable terms or at all. We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceuticals or diagnostic products for companion animals and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and motivate qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively oversee a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. If we are unable to build an effective sales organization and/or if we are unable to secure relationships with third-party distributors for our product candidates, we will not be able to successfully commercialize any product for which we receive marketing approval, our future product revenue will suffer and we would incur significant additional losses.\nIn jurisdictions outside of the United States we intend to utilize companies with an established commercial presence to market our products in those jurisdictions, but we may be unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, it at all.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop any of our existing or future product candidates, conduct our in-licensing and development efforts and commercialize any of our existing or future drug candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management, particularly Shameze Rampertab, CPA, CA, our interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Stephanie Morley, DVM, our President and Chief Operations Officer, and Bruk Herbst, our Chief Commercial Officer. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our existing or future product pipeline, completion of our planned development efforts or the commercialization of our product candidates. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Dr. Morley and Mr. Herbst for one-year terms (automatically extending for one-year terms thereafter) there can be no assurance that either of Dr. Morley or Mr. Herbst will extend their terms of service. We have also entered into an employment agreement Mr. Rampertab without a fixed term of service.\nConsolidation of our customers could negatively affect the pricing of our products.\nVeterinarians will be our primary customers for any approved products. In recent years, there has been a trend towards the consolidation of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals. If this trend continues, these large clinics and hospitals could attempt to leverage their buying power to obtain favorable pricing from us and other companion animal pharmaceutical and diagnostic products companies. Any resulting downward pressure on the prices of any of our approved products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization and may not successfully manage our growth.\nWe will need to significantly expand our organization and systems to support our future expected growth. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we will not be successful, and our business could fail.\nOur research and development rely on testing in animals, which is controversial and may become subject to bans or additional regulations.\nWe must test our product candidates in target animals to obtain marketing approval. Although our animal testing will be subject to GLP and GCP requirements, as applicable, animal testing in the human pharmaceutical industry and in other industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Some organizations and individuals have sought to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing. To the extent that such bans or regulations are imposed, our research and development activities, and by extension our operating results and financial condition, could be materially adversely affected. In addition, negative publicity about animal practices by us or in our industry could harm our reputation among potential customers for our products.\nBecause our directors may serve as directors or officers of other companies, they may have a conflict of interest in making decisions for our business.\nOur directors may serve as directors or officers of other companies or have significant shareholdings in other veterinary pharmaceutical or diagnostic products companies and, to the extent that such other companies may participate in ventures in which we may participate, our directors may have a conflict of interest in negotiating and concluding terms respecting the extent of such participation. In the event that such a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of our directors, we expect that the director who has such a conflict will declare his conflict, abstain from voting for or against the approval of such participation or such terms and, if deemed necessary or advisable, recuse himself from any discussion concerning the matters in question. In some circumstances, a director may be unable to manage such conflicts and may therefore need to resign. Our directors are required to act honestly, in good faith and in our best interests. In determining whether or not we will participate in a particular business opportunity or enter into a particular business arrangement, we expect that the directors and officers will be guided by their fiduciary duties and take into account such matters as they deem relevant, including considering the degree of risk to which we may be exposed and our financial position at that time.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds in the future through debt financing which may impose operational restrictions on our business and may result in dilution to existing or future holders of our common shares.\nWe expect that we will need to raise additional capital in the future to help fund our business operations. Debt financing, if available, may require restrictive covenants, which may limit our operating flexibility and may restrict or prohibit us from:\n\u2022 paying dividends and/or making certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments;\n\u2022 incurring additional indebtedness or issuing certain preferred shares;\n\u2022 selling some or all of our assets;\n\u2022 entering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 creating certain liens or encumbrances;\n\u2022 merging, consolidating, selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022 designating our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nDebt financing may also involve debt instruments that are convertible into or exercisable for our common shares. The conversion of the debt to equity financing may dilute the equity position of our existing shareholders.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of veterinary therapeutic and diagnostic products. We may become subject to product liability claims resulting from the use of our product candidates. We do not currently have product liability insurance and we may not be able to obtain or maintain this type of insurance for any future trials or product candidates. In addition, product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. Being unable to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures that may be unsuccessful and could adversely dilute your ownership of our company.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other complementary assets and businesses and may also pursue strategic alliances. We have no experience in acquiring other assets or businesses and have limited experience in forming such alliances. We may not be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or become subject to possible stockholder claims in connection with any related-party or third-party acquisitions or other transactions. We also could experience adverse effects on our reported results of operations from acquisition-related charges, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles and impairment charges relating to write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets from time to time following an acquisition. Integration of an acquired company requires management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license or strategic alliance.\nTo finance future acquisitions, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute your ownership interest in us. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nVarious government regulations could limit or delay our ability to develop and commercialize our products or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nIn the U.S., the manufacture and sale of certain diagnostic products are regulated by agencies such as the USDA, the FDA or the EPA. While our point-of-care Bulk Acoustic Wave sensor-based diagnostic platform and Raman spectroscopy-based diagnostic platform and our reference lab-based diagnostic test for canine cancer do not require approval by the USDA-CVB prior to sale in the U.S., these diagnostic solutions will be subject to post-marketing oversight by the FDA-CVM. In addition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products, as well as our research and development processes, are subject to similar and potentially more stringent laws in foreign countries.\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products; our business practices in the U.S. and abroad, such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws; and immigration and travel restrictions. These legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex. The costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future.\nAny failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines, penalties and sanctions; product recalls; suspensions or discontinuations of, or limitations or restrictions on, our ability to design, manufacture, market, import, export or sell our products; and damage to our reputation.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB obligations and continued regulatory oversight, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, any product candidates, if approved, will be subject to labeling and manufacturing requirements and could be subject to other restrictions. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unanticipated problems with our products could result in significant penalties.\nIf the FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB approves any of our existing or future therapeutic product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment registration, and product listing, as well as continued compliance with GMP, GLP and GCP for any studies that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary product recalls;\n\u2022 fines, warning letters or holds on target animal studies;\n\u2022 refusal by the FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic collaborators, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022 product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u2022 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA-CVM\u2019s or USDA-CVB\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to market our drug candidates in the United States, if approved, will be limited to use for the treatment of the indications for which they are approved, and if we want to expand the indications for which we may market our product candidates, we will need to obtain additional FDA-CVM approvals, which may not be granted.\nWe expect to seek FDA-CVM approval in the United States for our drug product candidates. If these drug product candidates are approved, the FDA-CVM will restrict our ability to market or advertise them for the treatment of indications other than the indications for which they are approved, which could limit their adoption by veterinarian and pet owners. We may attempt to develop, promote and commercialize new treatment indications and protocols for our drug product candidates in the future, but we cannot predict when or if we will receive the approvals required to do so. In addition, we would be required to conduct additional target animal studies to support our applications, which would utilize additional resources and may produce results that do not result in FDA-CVM approvals. If we do not obtain additional FDA-CVM approvals, our ability to expand our business in the United States will be limited.\nIf approved, any of our existing or future therapeutic products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to regulatory authorities and, if we fail to do so, we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nIf we are successful in commercializing any of our existing or future therapeutic product candidates, we will be required to report adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the regulatory authorities could take action including criminal prosecution, seizure of our products or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms with respect to veterinary pharmaceuticals or health care solutions may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of any of our existing or future product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products. In addition, FDA-CVM and USDA-CVB regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA-CVM and USDA-CVB in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Similar changes in laws or regulations can occur in other countries. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations in the United States may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any of our existing or future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u2022 changes to manufacturing methods;\n\u2022 recall, replacement or discontinuance of certain products; and\n\u2022 additional record-keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our product candidates is limited.\nOur diagnostic technologies are dependent on intellectual property developed by our strategic partners and licensed to us. We do not own the intellectual property rights that underlie these technology licenses. Our rights to use the technology we license are subject to the negotiation of, continuation of and compliance with the terms of our licenses. However, we have filed four U.S. patent applications and two Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications for U.S. and international protection of our diagnostic tests. These applications cover tests developed for our ZM-017, ZM-022 and ZM-020 technology platforms. Even if such patents are issued, we do not expect that all of the patents will provide significant protection for our intellectual property.\nSome of our products may or may not be covered by a patent. Further if an application is filed, it is not certain that a patent will be granted or if granted whether it will be held to be valid. All of which may impact our market share and ability to prevent others (competitor third parties) from making, selling, or using our products.\nWe intend to rely upon a combination of regulatory exclusivity periods, patents, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and license agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our current product candidates and our development programs. We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, including our unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or in avoiding claims that we infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. In addition to relying on patent and trademark rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, customers and suppliers to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, these methods and our patents and trademarks may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching confidentiality agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. In the future, we may also rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights and contractual rights, and, if not successful, we may not be able to protect the value of our intellectual property. Any litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations regardless of its outcome.\nIf we are unable to obtain trademark registrations for our products our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have pending trademark applications for our company name and composite marks comprised of our company name, logo and/or slogan in the U.S., Canada, European Union, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. In addition, we have approved pending trademark applications for our \u201cVoice of the Vet\u201d mark in the U.S. and Canada. We have secured two registrations in the European Union for our company name, company name and logo, and for the mark \u201cVoice of the Vet powered by Zomedica\u201d (and Design). We also have secured registrations in Brazil for our company name and logo. While we cannot make assurances that any pending trademark applications will mature to registration, most of these applications are now poised to mature to registration.\nWe have also filed for protection of several product names in the U.S., Canada and European Union. Currently, no significant hurdles have been encountered in the registration process. Moreover, any name we propose to use with our product candidates in the United States must be approved by the FDA-CVM or the USDA-CVB regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA-CVM typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA-CVM or the USDA-CVB object to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA-CVM and the USDA-CVB.\nThird parties may have intellectual property rights, which may require us to obtain a license or other applicable rights to make, sell or use our products. If such rights are not granted or obtained, I could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain, or license from third parties, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Although we believe our intellectual property rights are sufficient to allow us to conduct our business without incurring liability to third parties, our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of such persons. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to claims asserting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties seeking damages, the payment of royalties or licensing fees and/or injunctions against the sale of our products. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur diagnostic technologies depend on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from marketing our diagnostic product candidates.\nOur diagnostic technologies are dependent on intellectual property developed by our strategic partners and licensed to us. We do not own the intellectual property rights that underlie these licenses. Our rights to use the technology we license are subject to the negotiation of, continuation of and compliance with the terms of our licenses. We do not control the prosecution, maintenance or filing of the patents and other intellectual property licensed to us, or the enforcement of these intellectual property rights against third parties. The patents and patent applications underlying our licenses were not written by us or our attorneys, and we do not have control over the drafting and prosecution of such rights. Our partners might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution of patents and patent applications as we would have if we had been the owners of the intellectual property rights and had control over such drafting and prosecution. We cannot be certain that drafting and/or prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications has been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights.\nOur intellectual property agreements with third parties may be subject to disagreements over contract interpretation, which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase our financial or other obligations to our licensors.\nCertain provisions in our intellectual property agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could affect the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or affect financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical or animal health companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any such claims. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, such litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related to Our Preferred Shares\nWe will be obligated to pay a significant portion of our net sales to the holders of our Series 1 Preferred Shares. This payment obligation will materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources, may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital, and could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares.\nWe are obligated to make annual payments to the holders of our Series 1 Preferred Shares in an amount equal to nine percent of the net sales (as defined in the Series 1 Preferred Shares), if any, of our company and our affiliates (the \u201cNet Sales Payments\u201d) until such time as the holders have received total Net Sales Payments equal to nine times the aggregate stated value of the outstanding Series 1 Preferred Shares. Such payments will materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources which could result in a shortage of capital necessary to fund our operations or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Our obligation to make these payments may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. This payment obligation also may adversely affect investor perceptions of our company which could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares.\nIn the event of a sale of our company, holders of our Series 1 Preferred Shares will be entitled to a substantial premium on the purchase price they paid for their Series 1 Preferred Shares, which will reduce the sale proceeds to be received by holders of our common shares.\nIn the event that our company is the subject of a \u201cfundamental transaction\u201d (defined in the Series 1 Preferred Shares to include an amalgamation, merger or other business combination transaction involving our company in which our shareholders do not have the right to cast more than 50% of the votes that may be cast for the election of directors, or a sale, lease or other disposition of the properties and/or assets of our company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to a third party) the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Shares will have the right, in preference to the holders of our common shares, to receive a portion of the aggregate consideration paid in the fundamental transaction that will represent a substantial premium on the purchase price they paid for their Series 1 Preferred Shares. Such premium will reduce the proceeds of any such fundamental transaction that would be received by holders of our common shares.\nIn the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, holders of the Series 1 Preferred Shares will have a liquidation preference over holders of our common shares and if the net assets of our company available for distribution to holders of our equity securities is not sufficient to pay this liquidation preference in full, holders of our common shares would receive no liquidating distribution in respect of their common shares.\nIn the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, holders of the Series 1 Preferred Shares will have a liquidation preference equal to the stated value of the Series 1 Preferred Shares less the Net Sales Returns (as defined in the Series 1 Preferred Shares) paid on the Series 1 Preferred Shares before holders of our common shares would be entitled to any proceeds of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. If the net assets of our company available for distribution to holders of our equity securities is not sufficient to pay this liquidation preference in full, holders of our common shares would receive no liquidating distribution in respect of their common shares.\nOur Series 1 Preferred Shares will be reclassified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet once we begin to recognize revenues which may cause us to fail to meet the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nBecause we are obligated to make annual payments to the holders of our Series 1 Preferred Shares in an amount equal to nine percent of the Net Sales (as defined in the Series 1 Preferred Shares), if any, of our company and our affiliates, once we begin to recognize revenues from our commercial activities, we will be required under United States general accounting principles to reclassify the Series 1 Preferred Shares as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The reclassification will significantly increase our total liabilities and significantly reduce our shareholders\u2019 equity. Under the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing requirements, we are required to maintain shareholders\u2019 equity of at least $4.0 million, which will increase to $6.0 million after December 31, 2020. As a result of the reclassification, we may fail to meet this continued listing requirement. If we are unable to satisfy the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing requirements, our common shares could be delisted from the NYSE American which could adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common shares.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares\nWe believe that we will be a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d or PFIC for the current taxable year, which could subject certain U.S. shareholders to materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nWe believe we were classified as a PFIC during our taxable year ended 2018, and based on current business plans and financial expectations, we expect to be a PFIC for the current and future taxable years. If we are a PFIC for any year in which you hold shares and you are a U.S. Holder (as defined below, in \u201cMaterial United States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d), unless you make a timely and effective Qualified Electing Fund election, or QEF Election or a mark-to-market election, or Mark-to-Market Election with respect to our common shares, you will not be eligible for the reduced tax rates associated with \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d with respect to distributions made to you or long-term capital gain upon a disposition of your common shares. Instead, all such distributions and gain will be taxable to you at the higher rates for ordinary income. In addition, a portion of any gain and distribution may be allocated to prior years during which you have owned our common shares and subjected to tax at the highest tax rate applicable to ordinary income in each such year. You would also be required to pay an interest charge on that portion of such gain or distribution.\nIf you are a U.S. Holder and make a timely and effective QEF Election, you generally must report on a current basis your share of our net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which we are a PFIC, whether or not we distribute any amount to you, thus giving rise to so-called \u201cphantom income\u201d and to a potential tax liability. At this time, we intend to provide U.S. Holders with information required annually in order to allow such holders to make effective QEF Elections, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.\nIf you are a U.S. Holder and make a timely and effective Mark-to-Market Election, you generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of your common shares over your tax basis therein, thus also possibly giving rise to phantom income and a potential tax liability. Ordinary loss generally is recognized only to the extent of net mark-to-market gains previously included in income.\nEach U.S. shareholder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the PFIC rules and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of our common shares\nIf the Internal Revenue Service determines that we are not a PFIC and you previously paid taxes pursuant to a QEF Election or a Mark-to-Market Election, you may pay more taxes than you legally owe.\nIf the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, makes a determination that we are not a PFIC and you previously paid taxes pursuant to a QEF Election or Mark-to-Market Election, then you may have paid more taxes than you legally owed due to such election. If you do not, or are unable to, file a refund claim before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, you will not be able to claim a refund for those taxes.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding us or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nAlthough we have research coverage by securities and industry analysts, if coverage is not maintained, the market price for our stock may be adversely affected. Our stock price also may decline if any analyst who covers us issues an adverse or erroneous opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our target animal studies and operating results fail to meet analysts\u2019 expectations. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and possibly adversely affect our ability to engage in future financings.\nWe expect that the price of our common shares will fluctuate substantially.\nYou should consider an investment in our common shares risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of your investment. The price of our common shares that will prevail in the market after the sale of our common shares by a selling shareholder may be higher or lower than the price you have paid. Numerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common shares. These risks include those described or referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report as well as, among other things:\n\u2022 any delays in, or suspension or failure of, our existing and future studies;\n\u2022 announcements of regulatory approval or disapproval of any of our existing or future product candidates or of regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022 delays in the commercialization of our existing or future product candidates;\n\u2022 manufacturing and supply issues related to our development programs and commercialization of our existing or future product candidates;\n\u2022 quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 changes in our earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or adverse publicity about us or our product candidates;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of new product candidates, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u2022 announcements relating to future development or license agreements including termination of such agreements;\n\u2022 adverse developments with respect to our intellectual property rights or those of our principal collaborators;\n\u2022 commencement of litigation involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022 any major changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022 new legislation in the United States relating to the prescription, sale, distribution or pricing of pet pharmaceuticals or diagnostic products;\n\u2022 product liability claims, other litigation or public concern about the safety of our product candidates or future products;\n\u2022 market conditions in the animal health industry, in general, or in the pet therapeutics sector, in particular, including performance of our competitors; and\n\u2022 general economic conditions in the United States and abroad.\nIn addition, the stock market, in general, or the market for stocks in our industry, in particular, may experience broad market fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our common shares. Any sudden decline in the market price of our common shares could trigger securities class-action lawsuits against us. If any of our shareholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the time and attention of our management would be diverted from our business and operations. We also could be subject to damages claims if we are found to be at fault in connection with a decline in our stock price.\nOur management owns a significant percentage of our common shares and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval.\nBased on shares outstanding as of February 26, 2019, our executive officers and directors and their respective affiliates beneficially own 19,135,956 or 14.84% of our voting shares. These shareholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position and may be able to determine all matters requiring shareholder approval. For example, these shareholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approvals of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common shares that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our shareholders.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act and if we take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d our common shares could be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or SOX, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive if we choose to continue to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, however, and, as a result, we are required to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nOur Articles of Amalgamation (as amended) authorize us to issue an unlimited number of common shares and preferred shares without shareholder approval and we may issue additional equity securities, or engage in other transactions that could dilute your ownership interest, which may adversely affect the market price of our common shares\nOur Articles of Amalgamation (as amended) authorize our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of the ABCA, to issue an unlimited number of common shares and preferred shares without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors may determine from time to time to raise additional capital by issuing common shares, preferred shares or other equity securities. We are not restricted from issuing additional securities, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common shares or preferred shares. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be affected. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common shares, or both. Holders of our common shares are not entitled to pre-emptive rights or other protections against dilution. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, the then-current holders of our common shares. Additionally, if we raise additional capital by making offerings of debt or preference shares, upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred shares, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, may receive distributions of our available assets before the holders of our common shares.\nWe have incurred significant costs as a result of operating as a U.S. public company, and our management will continue to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a U.S. publicly traded company, we will incur additional significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we have not incurred in the past, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the JOBS Act, and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, have created uncertainty for U.S. public companies and increased our costs and time that our board of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other U.S. public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d These exceptions provide for, but are not limited to, relief from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, less extensive disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. See \u201cJOBS Act\u201d in this report. To the extent we are no longer eligible to use exemptions from various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, we may be unable to realize our anticipated cost savings from those exemptions.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nAs a Canadian public company, we were not required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in a manner that meets the standards of U.S. public companies required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. We were required to meet these standards in the course of preparing our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our management has reported on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year. Additionally, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nIn connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. We will be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration statement if we are not in compliance with Section 404. Furthermore, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nIf we sell common shares in future financings, shareholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our share price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional common shares at a discount from the existing trading price of our common shares. As a result, our shareholders would experience immediate dilution upon the sale of any shares of our common shares at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred shares or common shares. If we issue common shares or securities convertible into common shares, our common shareholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our share price may decline.\nFuture sales of our common shares by our shareholders or the perception that these sales may occur could cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 108,038,398 common shares outstanding, including a total of 3,977,714 common shares issued to our strategic partners. We are contractually obligated to register those common shares for resale or other disposition under the Securities Act. We filed a registration statement on Form S-3 to permit the sale or other disposition of these common shares along with additional common shares we have issued in two private placements during 2018. In addition, substantially all of our other outstanding common shares have been registered for resale or other disposition by the holders thereof or are otherwise freely tradable by the holders thereof.\nSales of a substantial number of our common shares by our shareholders or the perception that these sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nWe have never and do not, in the future, intend to pay dividends on our common shares, and your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the market price of our common shares.\nWe have never paid and do not expect to pay dividends on our common shares in the future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and not to pay any cash dividends on our common shares. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market price of our common shares. There is no assurance that our common shares will appreciate in price.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common shares may not develop or be sustained, and you may not be able to sell your common shares.\nOur common shares trade on the NYSE American exchange. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common shares will develop or be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell the common shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling common shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses, applications or technologies using our common shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American. If we are unable to comply with such requirements, our common shares would be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors\u2019 ability to effect transactions in our common shares and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common shares are currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain our listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable.", "PERMNO": 17103, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ZOM"}
