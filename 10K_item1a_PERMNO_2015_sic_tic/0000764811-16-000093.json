The following discussion highlights the risks that management believes are material for our Company, but do not necessarily include all the risks that we may face. You should carefully consider the risk factors and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cReport\u201d) in evaluating an investment in COB\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Related to our Business and Business Strategy\nWe may not be able to meet our targets for organic loan, deposit and services growth.\nOur business strategy includes organically growing loans and deposits through a variety of channels, including through our branches and loan production offices (\u201cLPOs\u201d), which we have staffed with mortgage loan officers, private bankers and commercial loan officers. We also offer loans through a non-branch based retail mortgage loan channel and a Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) unit. We met our organic growth goals in 2015 but continuing to meet our growth goals for loans and deposits depends on our ability to successfully market and generate new loan and deposit volume from these channels, as well as successfully market complementary products and services, particularly treasury management services and online and mobile banking capabilities, at acceptable risk levels and upon acceptable terms, while managing the costs associated with this growth strategy. While the loan and deposit products we are offering are not new to the Bank, treasury management services and online and mobile banking services designed to support our growth strategy involve implementation and operational risks. The strategies also depend upon hiring and retaining experienced lenders in target markets who share our relationship banking philosophy. Because of a variety of factors, including the pending Merger of COB into Capital, which impacts our ability to attract and retain additional appropriate talent, the ability to have effective marketing and calling programs, continuing to successfully implement our treasury, online and mobile banking platforms containing adequate protections to mitigate risks, as well as market conditions and competition, there is no assurance that we will be able to meet our growth goals, or if we are successful, that such growth would meet profitability, cost or asset quality targets associated with the goals. An inability to grow or to effectively manage our growth could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nOur decisions regarding credit risk could be incorrect, and our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur largest source of revenue is interest payments on loans made to Bank customers. There are certain risks inherent in making loans. Borrowers may not repay their loans according to the terms of those loans, and the collateral securing the payment of the loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Interest rates may change over the life of the loan, economic conditions may change and the value of the collateral affecting the loans may deteriorate. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of the borrowers and the value of the real estate, which is obtained from independent appraisers, and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of the loans. However, we may be incorrect in these assumptions, in which case we may experience significant loan losses and losses on foreclosed collateral which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe maintain an Allowance for Loan Losses (\u201cALL\u201d) that we consider adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on our assessment of all available information. In determining the size of the allowance, we rely on an analysis of the loan portfolio based on, among other things, historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, and general economic conditions, both local and national. During the past year, as our credit performance has improved, this analysis has allowed us to reduce our ALL by $5.2 million. If management\u2019s assumptions in undertaking this analysis are wrong, the ALL may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. Additionally, any new deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside management\u2019s control, may require an increase in the ALL. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nBanking regulators periodically review our ALL and may require us to increase the allowance or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different from those of management. Any increase in the ALL or loan charge-offs as required by regulatory authorities could have adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition.\nWeaknesses in the markets for residential or commercial real estate could reduce our net income and profitability.\nLoans that are secured by real estate (including commercial, construction and development and consumer residential mortgage loans) as either the primary or secondary source of repayment are a large portion of the Bank's loan portfolio. These categories constitute $1.28 billion, or approximately 83% of the Bank's total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015. These categories are generally affected by changes in economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes\nin tax and other laws and acts of nature. Commercial real estate secured lending usually involves higher credit risk than that of single-family residential mortgage lending because of the larger loan balances and the fact that adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy may impact the development and leasing of their properties and thus their cash flow. While the real estate markets in the communities we operate continue to recover from the 2009 recession, real estate in our urban markets (e.g. Charlotte) has recovered faster than real estate in our more rural markets, the impact of which is that our loan origination activity in our urban markets has increased faster than in our legacy rural markets. Any new downturn in the real estate markets in which we originate, purchase and service secured commercial, construction and development or consumer residential mortgage loans could hurt our business and future earnings both because these loans are secured by real estate and because loan demand for these type of loans would decrease.\nOur mortgage business is sensitive to our success in hiring and retaining mortgage loan officers, maintaining a mix of conforming and other mortgages, as well as in changes in economic conditions, increased interest rates, and a slowdown in the housing market, any of which could impact adversely our results of operations.\nMortgage originations and sales are a significant portion of our consolidated business and maintaining or increasing our mortgage revenue is dependent upon our ability to originate loans. We expanded our mortgage origination capabilities during 2015 by hiring experienced mortgage loan officers in both our branch channel and our non-branch retail origination channel, which is targeted toward more urban markets, principally Charlotte, Raleigh and Winston-Salem. There is no assurance that we will be able to identify, hire and retain such officers, particularly given our pending Merger with Capital, and failure to do so would adversely affect our mortgage originations and consequently, our overall net income.\nFurthermore, our revenue in this segment is in part reliant upon originating and selling loans that conform to the underwriting criteria of third parties, which was 42% of 2015's originations, and recording the gain on sale from such sales. Our mortgage division offers a mix of conforming and other types of mortgage loans, including jumbos and superjumbos, construction and specialized loan programs that meet the needs of our customers. While we target a percentage of loans for each loan type, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain the mix of mortgages that meet our revenue goals. In addition, our mortgage revenue is dependent on originating both refinance and purchase money mortgages. During 2015, purchase money mortgages constituted approximately 39% of our production and that percentage is expected to continue in that range during 2016. Mortgage loan production levels are sensitive to changes in interest rates and economic conditions and changes in the housing market, as well as changes in underwriting standards, and have previously suffered from increases in interest rates or slowdowns in the housing market. Any sustained period of decreased origination activity caused by housing price pressure, underwriting standards, or increases in interest rates would adversely affect our mortgage originations, and consequently, our overall net income.\nChanges in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur earnings and financial condition depend to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of the margin between interest rates earned on loans and investments and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. We can neither predict with certainty nor control changes in interest rates. These changes can occur at any time and are affected by many factors, including international, national, regional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. In the unlikely event the Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step of reducing short-term interest rates below zero, the bank could experience additional narrowing of the margin between interest rates earned on loans and investments and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings. In addition, our customers often have the ability to prepay loans with either no penalties or penalties that are insufficient to compensate us for the lost income. If customers prepay loans at a higher rate, we may not be able to recover the lost revenues, which would affect our results of operations.\nFurthermore, since 2008 interest rates have been low for an extended period of time, and any increase in rates could result in depositors redeeming time deposits or moving funds out of their existing money market or savings deposit accounts at the Bank into other interest-bearing alternatives at other financial institutions, including third party money market funds. We have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates, including these prepayment and deposit run-off risks, and we model expected customer behavior based on historical experience of other interest rate cycles. Notwithstanding these policies and procedures, our customers may not react to changes in interest rates in the same manner in which they historically have reacted, resulting in a larger outflow of deposits or a higher level of loan prepayments than we expect. Such reaction could require us to increase interest rates to retain or acquire deposits, or lower loan rates to retain or attract loans. In either case, our deposit costs may increase and our loan interest income may decline, either or both of which may have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may not be able to effectively work out nonperforming assets, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and require us to raise additional capital.\nSince our recapitalization in 2011, the Bank has aggressively and materially reduced problem assets through workouts, restructurings, foreclosures and sales. The size of these problem assets is now smaller and we thus expect the pace of resolution to continue to slow. When we receive a signed contract for the sale of a loan or other real estate owned (\"OREO\") asset, the asset is marked down to the\ncontract price less associated selling costs, which may ultimately result in a loss to the Bank. Any decrease in the value of the underlying collateral securing Bank loans, adverse change in borrowers' performance or financial condition, or a decrease in the value of OREO, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in nonperforming assets in the future, or that the workout of our current nonperforming assets will not result in further losses. A new downturn in the market areas we serve could increase our credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, as it could have a material adverse effect on both the ability of borrowers to repay loans as well as the value of the real property or other property held as collateral for such loans, or in OREO. If credit costs are incurred over what we anticipate to resolve our remaining problem assets and reduce our credit risk to what we consider acceptable levels, we may need to raise additional capital. Factors affecting whether additional capital would be required include, among others, additional provision of loan losses, and loan charge-offs, additional write-downs in the carrying value of our OREO, changing requirements of regulators, and other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. There can be no assurance that we would be able to raise capital in the amounts required and in a timely manner or at all. Any additional capital raised may be significantly dilutive to our existing shareholders and may result in the issuance of securities that have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to our common stock.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited or restricted or may not exist at all, and if we do not sustain our profitability, we may be required to put up a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nWe generated significant federal and state net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) between 2008 and 2014. We are generally able to carry NOLs forward to reduce taxable income in future years. Our ability to use our NOLs to reduce future tax payments is dependent upon our ability to sustain profitability over the time period over which these NOLs may be used under applicable tax law. At December 31, 2015 we determined, based on all available positive and negative evidence, that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be available during available carryforward periods to absorb all of the consolidated federal net operating loss carryforward and all of the North Carolina net economic loss carryforward. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to sustain our profitability, or accelerate it to the extent necessary to be able to use all of the NOLs we have generated, or that the conditions that led to our losses will not return. Our ability to generate sustained profitability in the amounts necessary to realize our deferred tax assets against future taxable income depends upon general economic and market conditions, interest rates, and our ability to meet our strategic plans. If we are unable to generate adequate sustained profitability, we may be required to record a new valuation allowance against some or all of our deferred tax assets, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nIn addition, the ability to utilize our NOLs is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 382 generally restricts the use of NOLs after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the shareholders (or specified groups of shareholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock or are otherwise treated as 5% shareholders under Section 382 and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder because of an increase of their aggregate percentage ownership of that corporation\u2019s stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these shareholders over a rolling three-year period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carryforwards. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of the corporation\u2019s stock on the date of the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOL carryforwards. Consummation of our pending Merger with Capital will result in an \u201cownership change\u201d at COB within the meaning of Section 382, resulting in a limitation on the resulting entity of the amount of taxable income it may offset with COB NOLs.\nThe loss of any member of the executive and senior management may adversely affect us.\nWe have assembled an executive and senior management team that has substantial background and experience in banking and financial services in the markets we serve. We rely heavily on the experience and expertise of our management to resolve problems and deploy new capital to achieve sustainable profitability and satisfactory capital levels. We have implemented a management succession planning process where we identify successors to our management team and work to train those managers for higher roles. The loss of key management personnel could negatively impact our earnings because of their skills, customer relationships and/or the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them with their chosen successors. In the Merger, it is anticipated that the five most senior officers of the Company will cease employment with the combined company at the Merger date.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain competent, experienced people. Our organic growth goals in particular require that we be able to attract and retain qualified and experienced mortgage loan officers, commercial lending officers and SBA lenders who share our relationship banking philosophy and have those customer relationships that will allow us to successfully expand. Many of our competitors are pursuing the same relationship banking strategy in our markets, which increases the competition to identify and hire talented employees. Our pending Merger with Capital has and will continue to result in those competitors seeking to hire our lending and other banking officers and other employees. Our failure to successfully retain\nexperienced, qualified employees through the merger process may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial goals and thus adversely affect our future results of operations.\nAs a community bank, we are vulnerable to the economic conditions within the relatively small region in which we operate.\nWe operate in a relatively small market area, which extends from the central and southern Piedmont and Sandhills of North Carolina to the mountains of western North Carolina, in addition to Charleston, S.C. Furthermore, we lend primarily to individuals and to small and medium-sized businesses in those or adjacent markets. Thus, we are exposed to greater risk than banks that lend to larger commercial enterprises or have a bigger market footprint. We manage our credit exposure through careful monitoring of our borrowers and loan concentrations and through rigorous application and review procedures. We also balance our geographic risk by purchasing portfolios of loans to borrowers outside of our market area. Nevertheless, we remain limited in our ability to diversify our economic risks. While economic conditions continue to improve in our market areas, any economic downturn in this fairly small geographic region likely will negatively affect our customers through increased unemployment, reduced demand and depressed real estate values, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may experience significant competition in our market area, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe commercial banking industry within our market area is extremely competitive. We also compete with other providers of financial services, such as savings associations and savings banks, credit unions, insurance companies, consumer finance companies, brokerage firms, the mutual funds industry and commercial finance and leasing companies, some of which are subject to less extensive regulation than us with respect to the products and services they provide. Our larger competitors include large interstate financial holding companies that are among the largest in the nation and are headquartered in North Carolina. These companies have a significant presence in our market area, have greater resources than we do and may offer products and services that we do not offer. These institutions also may be able to offer the same products and services at more competitive rates and prices.\nOnline and mobile banking developments have the potential of disrupting our business model, thus adversely affecting our business.\nWe compete with a variety of institutions both inside and outside of our market area that also offer online and mobile banking services. These institutions include our traditional competition, as well as institutions that solely operate online. Changes in customer behavior over the past several years have resulted in the need to offer online and mobile banking options to our customers. While we continue to spend significant resources upgrading our online and mobile banking capabilities, changes in customer behaviors in this area could disrupt our branch based and relationship banking model, which could adversely affect our operations, and we may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes.\nWe face significant operational risk.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including traditional operational risk, strategic risk, reputational risk, and legal and compliance risk. Operational risk includes the risk of fraud or theft by employees or persons outside COB, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems, and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Operational risk also includes potential legal actions that could arise from an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.\nBecause the nature of the banking business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are found and corrected. Our reliance upon both automated and manual systems to record and process transactions may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (e.g., computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their employees as is COB) and to the risk that our or our vendors' business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate.\nWe face heightened information security risks, including \u201chacking\u201d and \u201cidentity theft,\u201d from increasingly sophisticated cyber behaviors.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure used by us and others are vulnerable to unforeseen problems. These problems may arise in our internal systems, the systems of our third party vendors or both. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or security breaches of our information systems, resulting in stolen, misplaced or lost data, including unauthorized disclosure of customer information and theft. Information\nsecurity risks have increased in recent years in part because of the increased usage of online and mobile technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, governmental entities, activists and other parties to attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems, and/or those of our customers and third party service providers through viruses, malware, and other compromises, in order to gain access to customer information and engage in financial fraud and theft. We cannot be certain that all of our systems or those of our third party service providers, are free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards we have instituted to protect our systems and ensure those third party systems used by us are safe. In addition, we cannot be certain that the systems of our customers that interact with our systems are free from vulnerability to attack despite heightened customer education about the threats that exist and alternatives available to protect those systems. Any damage or failure or security intrusion that may cause an interruption in our operations, makes us susceptible to unauthorized access to our customer information, hacking or identity or financial theft, and could adversely affect our business and financial results, damage our reputation, cause loss of business, additional regulatory scrutiny or exposure to litigation and possible financial liability. We have purchased insurance against such losses, but any liability could exceed the amount of insurance coverage we have.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure including the software supporting our core operating system, mortgage servicing, card issuance and transaction processing, internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully and subject them to a comprehensive vendor management program, which includes ongoing due diligence over these vendors' financial condition and systems security, we do not directly control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those which result from their failure to provide services for any reason, their poor performance of services, their systems\u2019 vulnerability to cyber and other risks, or other issues could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing any of these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nOur controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and implemented, is based in part on certain assumptions and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance of the effectiveness of these systems and controls. Any failure or circumvention of our internal controls and procedures and any failure to comply with regulations related to internal controls and procedures could adversely affect our business, our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our reputation.\nOur efforts to reduce noninterest expenses may not be achievable or, if they are, may increase operational risk.\nIn order to sustain and enhance our profitability, we have, among other things, implemented a program to reduce noninterest expenses, primarily through vendor management activities, branch profitability analyses and other efficiency initiatives. These efforts to reduce noninterest expenses may not be achievable. Because of the pending Capital Merger, we are unable to negotiate favorable vendor terms and we are incurring significant new expenses in connection with the Merger. Alternatively, these noninterest expense reductions may increase our operational risk.\nUncertainty in the final resolution of purchased impaired loans may create a negative impact on our profitability.\nAs required by applicable accounting standards, we have accounted for purchased impaired loans acquired from Granite under ASC 310-30 which requires us to periodically re-estimate the expected cash flow of these loans. Lower expected cash flow, whether due to changes in projected cash flow estimates, increases in loss estimates, or defaults, may result in impairment of the carrying value of these loans. Any such impairment must be taken in the period in which the change in cash flow estimate occurs, and such impairment will reduce our earnings and adversely affect results of operations.\nOur reported financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to the procedures by which we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report COB\u2019s financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in us reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting COB\u2019s financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include: the ALL; the valuation of other real estate; the determination of fair value for financial instruments; purchased loan accounting; and the accounting for income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the ALL or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided or both; recognize\nsignificant impairment on its financial instruments (including purchased loans) and other intangible asset balances; or significantly increase its liabilities for taxes or pension and post-retirement benefits.\nRisks Related to the Merger with Capital Bank\nThe Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair COB\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company. Retention of certain employees by the Company may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined entity, COB\u2019s business could be harmed.\nCombining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized.\nThe Company has operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently from Capital in the ordinary course of business. The success of the Merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on Capital\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of the Company with Capital in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. As noted, it is anticipated that the five most senior officers of the Company will cease their employment with the combined company at the Merger date. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of other key employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to successfully conduct its business, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s financial results and the value of its stock. If Capital experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause the Company or Capital Bank to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from the Company and/or Capital and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during this transition period and on the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the Merger. In addition, the actual cost savings of the Merger could be less than anticipated.\nRegulatory approvals for the Merger may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger.\nBefore the Merger may be completed, Capital must obtain approvals from the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. In determining whether to grant these approvals, the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party and the factors described under \u2018\u2018Supervision and Regulation - CommunityOne Bancorp.\u2019\u2019 An adverse development in either party\u2019s regulatory standing or these factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their receipt. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger or the bank merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger or the bank merger. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Merger or the bank merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not completed, the Company and Capital will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.\nThe Company and Capital Bank each has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, the Company would have to recognize the expenses it has incurred without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger, which could materially impact the Company\u2019s earnings and results of operations.\nBecause of the pending Merger, COB common stock trades at a market price relative to Capital Class A commons stock market price and will be impacted by market fluctuations in Capital Class A common stock.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of COB common stock, except for treasury stock, will be converted into the right to receive either (i) $14.25 in cash or (ii) 0.43 shares of Capital Class A common stock,\nbased on the holder\u2019s election and subject to proration. Currently, the price of COB common stock trades at a market price relative to the Capital Class A common stock. The market value of Capital Class A common stock may fluctuate while the Merger is pending due to a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Capital\u2019s businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are outside of the control of the Company and Capital Bank. Furthermore, upon completion of the Merger, holders of COB common stock who receive stock consideration in the Merger will become holders of Capital Class A common stock. Capital\u2019s businesses differ from those of COB, and accordingly, the results of operations of Capital will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of COB, which may impact the stock price.\nThe Merger Agreement limits COB\u2019s ability to pursue acquisition proposals and requires COB to pay a termination fee of $14 million under limited circumstances, including circumstances relating to acquisition proposals.\nThe Merger Agreement prohibits the Company from initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating certain third party acquisition proposals. The Merger Agreement also provides that the Company must pay a termination fee in the amount of $14 million in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including involving the Company\u2019s failure to abide by certain obligations not to solicit acquisition proposals and the COB board of directors withdrawing or materially and adversely changing its recommendation that COB shareholders approve the Merger proposal. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing such an acquisition.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences. For example, the Company\u2019s businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. Additionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, COB may be required to pay Capital a termination fee of $14 million.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\nOur deposit insurance premiums have decreased but may increase in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our future earnings.\nThe FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank to the maximum extent provided by law. The FDIC charges the Bank premiums to maintain that insurance at specified levels. The assessments imposed by the FDIC for deposit insurance at the Bank have decreased, but they may increase in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target deposit insurance ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits, which must be met by September 30, 2020. The FDIC has issued regulations to implement these provisions and has established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute. The FDIC may increase the assessment rates or impose a special assessment in the future to keep the deposit insurance fund at the statutory target level. Any increase in FDIC insurance assessment would reduce our earnings.\nThe implementation of capital requirements based on Basel III may require us to hold additional capital.\nUnder revised capital requirements implemented by the federal banking agencies (known as Basel III capital requirements) effective for community banks and their holding companies as of January 1, 2015, the leverage and risk-based capital requirements (including the prompt corrective action framework) changed, including the definition of the regulatory capital components required to be held by community banks and their holding companies (including introducing a new capital component called common equity tier 1 or CET 1 capital), the type and minimum amount of capital that must be held under each capital component, the risk weightings of certain assets against which capital must be held, and the methodology for certain off-balance sheet items, as described under \u201cRegulation and Supervision - Capital.\u201d The revised rules also impose a capital conservation buffer of up to 2.5% above each of the capital ratio requirements (CET 1, tier 1, and total risk-based capital) which must be met for a bank and its holding company to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. The impact of these new requirements may have the effect of reducing our returns on equity, or requiring us to modify our business strategy or raise additional capital.\nIn addition, in the current regulatory environment, the federal banking agencies have the power to impose additional capital requirements that are more stringent than those required under these revised rules. The application of more stringent capital requirements also could result in us experiencing lower returns on equity, require us to raise additional capital or be subject to regulatory action if we are unable to comply with these requirements.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe BSA, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions such as the Bank to, among other duties, institute and maintain an effective BSA/AML program, including implementing comprehensive \"know your customer\" programs, monitoring suspicious financial activity and filing suspicious activity and current transaction reports. These rules are enforced by the federal banking agencies as well as by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service. While the Company has enhanced its BSA/AML program over the past four years to comply with law, failure to continue to maintain an effective BSA and AML program and to comply with these laws, rules and regulations would subject the Company and the Bank to liability, including regulatory fines and additional supervisory and legal actions. Such failure also could impact the timing and ability of Capital to proceed with its acquisition of the Company. Such actions and restrictions would have a material adverse effect on our reputation and would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued implementation of the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act may result in lower revenues and higher costs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has included, among other things, the establishment of strengthened capital and prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies; the imposition of limits on interchange fees on debit card transactions; enhanced regulation of financial markets, including derivatives and securitization markets; the elimination of certain trading activities from banks; a permanent increase of the FDIC deposit insurance to $250,000; the elimination of the prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits; the creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation; and the creation of the CFPB, which has promulgated new consumer protection regulations relating to consumer financial products and services, particularly in the area of mortgage lending. Certain aspects of the new law, including, without limitation, the additional cost of higher deposit insurance, higher capital requirements, and the costs of compliance with enhanced disclosure, early intervention and loss mitigation, training and reporting requirements and integrated RESPA/TILA disclosures to mortgage borrowers that have been issued by the CFPB in a relatively short time frame, have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our business, and may affect our financial condition and results of operations. As additional CFPB rulemakings become effective in the coming year, particularly those that will affect our mortgage and small business loans and businesses, we expect our compliance costs to continue to be elevated, and that they may continue to affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nGovernment regulation significantly affects our business and changes in laws and regulations and the regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on COB and the Bank.\nWe are extensively regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not shareholders. These regulations affect our lending and deposit practices, capital structure, investment and dividend policies, and growth. In addition, we are subject to changes in federal and state laws and regulations, and governmental economic and monetary policies. We cannot predict whether any of these changes may adversely and materially affect us. The current regulatory environment for financial institutions, particularly since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, entails significant potential increases in compliance requirements and associated costs, including those related to consumer credit, with a focus on mortgage lending.\nFederal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums and limitations on our activities that could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nRisks Related to our Stock\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited, leaving appreciation in the value of our common stock as the sole opportunity for returns on investment.\nThe holders of COB common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. The ability of COB to pay dividends to its shareholders has been dependent upon the amount of dividends the Bank may pay to COB. Statutory and regulatory limitations are imposed on the payment of dividends by the Bank to COB, as well as by COB to its shareholders. Under applicable law, the Bank must obtain the prior OCC approval to pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year will exceed the sum of its net income for that year and its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years, less certain transfers. Federal law also prohibits the Bank from paying dividends that in the aggregate would be greater than its undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debts in excess of its ALL. The Bank, however, may obtain shareholder and OCC approval to reduce its capital to allow payment of dividends after cumulative losses in an amount greater than its undivided profits. The Bank has not paid dividends to the Company during 2015 and does not intend to pay dividends in 2016.\nThere is a limited market for our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the volume of trading has historically been limited. Our average daily trading volume of our shares during 2015 was approximately 21,500 shares. Lightly traded stock can be more volatile than stock trading in a more active public market. While we have made efforts to increase trading in our stock, we cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Therefore, a holder of our common stock who wishes to sell his or her shares may not be able to do so immediately or at an acceptable price.\nSubsequent resales of shares of our common stock in the public market may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nWe issued a large number of shares of our common stock to our investors in the 2011 recapitalization and in a private placement consummated on December 30, 2014. During 2015, we filed an effective registration statement for the shares issued in our 2014 private placement, as well as the shares issued to Carlyle and Oak Hill Capital and other investors in the recapitalization without any of those investors having to comply with the volume and manner of sale restrictions under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. While it is not anticipated that any of these investors will sell shares due to the pending Merger, the market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by the investors from time to time of a substantial amount of the shares of our common stock held by them.\nCarlyle and Oak Hill Capital are substantial holders of our common stock.\nEach of Carlyle and Oak Hill Capital hold approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and each has a representative on the Board of Directors of COB and the Bank. In addition, each of Carlyle and Oak Hill Capital has preemptive rights to maintain their percentage ownership of our common stock in the event of certain issuances of securities by COB. Although each of Carlyle and Oak Hill Capital entered into certain passivity and non-affiliation commitments with the Federal Reserve Board in connection with obtaining approval of its proposed investment in COB, in pursuing their economic interests, Carlyle and Oak Hill Capital may have interests that are different from the interests of our other shareholders. Additionally, the concentration of ownership by Carlyle and Oak Hill Capital means that they will also exert considerable, ongoing influence over matters subject to shareholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination or sale of our business. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other shareholders.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions and other Outside Forces\nWe may be subject to litigation from time to time, which could involve the expenditure of substantial resources and time to defend.\nFrom time to time, customers and others may take legal action against us. Customer defaults have also resulted in an increase in litigation. Whether or not any claims made are valid, if such claims are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant expense, attention from management and possibly financial liability, as well as cause damage to our reputation, all of which could have a negative effect on our business.\nMarket, economic and political developments may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are materially impacted by conditions in the economy and in the capital markets, both of which continue to be uncertain and impacted by both world and national events, such as sluggish economic growth, elevated unemployment rates and historically low interest rates. During the past six years, the financial markets have been under significant strain, resulting in financial instability, a depressed housing and manufacturing market, significant declines in asset values, employee dislocation, geopolitical issues and political uncertainly and diminished expectations for economic growth. These strains adversely affected our operations and financial results, and led to the need for our recapitalization. We have worked hard to overcome the material challenges facing our operations during the past five years, aggressively working out our criticized and classified assets, re-engaging with our communities, and returning the Bank to a satisfactory condition. While the financial market has been recovering, and conditions have improved, particularly in our urban markets, a return to a recessionary economy could result in financial stress on our borrowers that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending and volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and ultimately, the profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, and lower household income, corporate earnings, business investment and consumer spending, the demand for our products and services could be adversely affected. More generally, any financial or economic development that may raise new concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties may result in renewed lack of confidence in the financial sector, increased volatility in the financial markets and/or reduced business activity. Economic and market developments also could result in legislative and regulatory actions that could impact our business. Any of these results or actions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnpredictable catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, pandemic disease, windstorms, floods, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing rain, ice storms and blizzards), fires and other catastrophes could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Unpredictable natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on us in that such events could materially disrupt our operations or the ability or willingness of our customers to access the financial services we offer. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Although we carry insurance to mitigate our exposure to certain catastrophic events, these events could nevertheless reduce our earnings and cause volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or both.", "PERMNO": 80625, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "COB"}
