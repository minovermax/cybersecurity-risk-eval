{"cik": "1289790", "company": "Macquarie Infrastructure Co LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our shares involves a number of risks. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and could cause a corresponding decline in the market price of our shares.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations Fluctuations in economic, equity and credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms. Should the economic, equity and credit market conditions become disrupted, our ability to raise equity or obtain capital, to repay or refinance credit facilities at maturity, pay significant capital expenditures or fund growth may be costly and/or impaired. Our access to debt financing in particular will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit history and credit capacity, as well as the historical performance of our businesses and lender perceptions of their and our financial prospects. In the event that we are unable to obtain debt financing, particularly as significant credit facilities mature, our internal sources of liquidity may not be sufficient.\nEconomic conditions may also increase our counterparty risk, particularly in those businesses whose revenues are determined under multi-year contracts, such as IMTT, and businesses within our CP&E segment. Should conditions deteriorate, we would expect to see increases in counterparty defaults and/or bankruptcies, which could result in an increase in bad debt expense and may cause our operating results to decline.\nThe volatility in the financial markets makes projections regarding future obligations under pension plans difficult. Two of our businesses, Hawaii Gas and IMTT, have defined benefit retirement plans. Future funding obligations under those plans depend in large part on the future performance of plan assets and the mix of investment assets. Our defined benefit plans hold a significant amount of equity securities as well as fixed income securities. If the market values of these securities decline or if interest rates decline, our pension expense and cash funding requirements would increase and, as a result, could materially adversely affect the results and liquidity of these businesses and the Company.\nOur holding company structure may limit our ability to make regular dividends in the future to our shareholders because we will rely on the cash flows and distributions from our businesses. The Company is a holding company with no operations. Therefore, it is dependent upon the ability of our businesses to make distributions to the Company to enable it to meet its expenses, and to make dividends to shareholders in the future. The ability of our operating subsidiaries and the businesses in which we will hold investments to make distributions to the Company is subject to limitations based on their operating performance, the terms of their debt agreements, the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions, and compliance of co-investors with applicable contracts and agreements. In addition, the ability of each business to reduce its outstanding debt will be similarly limited by its operating performance, as discussed below and in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.\nThe documents governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions. The senior secured revolving credit facility imposes, and future debt agreements may impose, operational and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 pay dividends, redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022 make certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022 grant or permit certain liens on our assets;\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022 transfer or sell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, engage in business activities, including future opportunities that may be in our interest, and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. Acceleration of our other indebtedness could result in a default under the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility or our convertible senior notes. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nOur strategy includes an expectation that we will find, acquire and integrate additional infrastructure businesses. Although our businesses tend to benefit from stable fundamental drivers of growth over time, we will attempt to augment that growth by finding, acquiring and integrating additional infrastructure businesses. We may not find or be able to acquire such businesses on economically sensible terms. In addition, we may acquire businesses with financial reporting and control systems that are less sophisticated than ours. If we do make an acquisition, we may not be successful in integrating it into our portfolio and/or achieving the expected level of performance. Failure to do any of these could result in generating less cash than expected or generating growing amounts of cash at a slower than anticipated rate, either of which could result in a reduction in our share price. In January of 2015, we signed an agreement to acquire BEC, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. As with all acquisitions, BEC acquisition may not be completed on a timely basis or at all. If completed, failure to successfully integrate BEC into our portfolio or achieve anticipated operating results could adversely impact our business.\nDecreasing the proportion of infrastructure businesses in our portfolio that are not regulated or of predominantly contracted nature increases the potential volatility in our financial results. With the exception of our airport services business, our businesses generally possess some or all of the typical characteristics of infrastructure - high barriers to entry, generally inelastic demand, long-term contracts/concessions, stable yields, regulated operations, and inflation linked revenue. Our airport services business generates revenue and distributable cash in a way that is broadly reflective of the economic health of the country. To the extent we invest in or acquire businesses with revenue and cash generating capacity that is similarly GDP sensitive or businesses that do not possess the typical characteristics of infrastructure businesses, our financial results could become more volatile and our share price could decline as a result of an increase in the real or perceived increase in risk.\nIf borrowing costs increase or if debt terms become more restrictive, the cost of refinancing and servicing our debt will increase, reducing our profitability and ability to freely deploy Free Cash Flow. The majority of indebtedness at our primary businesses matures within three to six years. Refinancing this debt may result in substantially higher interest rates or margins or substantially more restrictive covenants. Any of these could limit operational flexibility or reduce dividends and/or distributions from our operating businesses to us, which would have an adverse impact on our ability to freely deploy Free Cash Flow. We cannot provide assurance that we or the other owners of any of our businesses will be able to make capital contributions to repay some or all of the debt if required.\nThe debt facilities at our businesses contain terms that become more restrictive over time, with stricter covenants and increased amortization schedules. Those terms will limit our ability to freely deploy Free Cash Flow.\nOur holding company level debt could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business. We financed a portion of our acquisition of the remaining interest in IMTT with the issuance of convertible senior notes. We also entered into a new senior secured revolving credit facility in connection with the IMTT acquisition. This holding company level debt increases our interest payments and could have significant effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022 we may be required to use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay interest on our indebtedness which will reduce the funds available for dividends to shareholders, additional acquisitions, pursuit of business opportunities or other business purposes;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired;\n\u2022 it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our contractual and commercial commitments;\n\u2022 our increased level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022 exposing us to risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022 our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited; and\n\u2022 our indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our businesses.\nWe expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and to repay our indebtedness primarily from our operating businesses. Our ability to meet our expenses and make these payments therefore depends on the future performance of our businesses, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our inability to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. As a holding company with no operations, we are dependent on the ability of our businesses to make distributions to us to pay our expenses and repay our indebtedness. In addition, the senior secured revolving credit facility is guaranteed by Macquarie Infrastructure Company Inc., or MIC Inc., our direct, wholly owned subsidiary. MIC Inc. is a holding company whose only material asset is the capital stock of our other subsidiaries. If we do not have enough funds, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more funds, which we may not be able to accomplish on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nWe and any of our existing or future subsidiaries may incur substantially more indebtedness in the future. This could further exacerbate the risks to our business as described herein. We and any of our existing and future subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of our senior secured revolving credit facility contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. In addition, IMTT currently has $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility in place. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility, the holders of that additional debt will be entitled to share ratably with the lenders or holders of the indebtedness under the senior secured revolving credit facility in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our Company. If new debt is added to our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could be exacerbated.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel, or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees, could have an adverse effect on our consolidating businesses, financial condition and results of operations. We operate our consolidating businesses on a stand-alone basis, relying on existing management teams for day-to-day operations. Consequently, our operational success, as well as the success of our internal growth strategy, will be dependent on the continued efforts of the management teams of our consolidating businesses, who have extensive experience in the day-to-day operations of these businesses. Furthermore, we will likely be dependent on the operating management teams of businesses that we may acquire in the future. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own, and may acquire in the future, investments in which we share voting control and, consequently, our ability to exercise significant influence over the business may be limited. While it is our preference to own our businesses outright or to be able to exercise significant influence over our investments, including with respect to the timing and amount of distributions to us from those businesses, we may in some cases find the potential economic benefits of owning less than a controlling interest to be compelling. In such cases we will attempt to co-invest with like-minded individuals/organizations. However, there can be no certainty that our interests with such co-investor(s) will always be aligned or that we will always be in a position to determine the amount and timing of distributions from such investments.\nDisputes with a prior co-investor has resulted in our being involved in an arbitration proceeding. While we prevailed in this arbitration, it was costly and diverted the attention of our management and there was a delay associated with receipt of the benefits to which we were entitled.\nOur ability to influence a joint venture business is typically governed by (and may be limited to) our rights under a shareholders\u2019 agreement. We may not directly manage the day to day operations of a joint venture, and we may not be provided with notice of material events with respect such joint venture businesses (including, without limitation, potential liabilities for environmental health and safety (\u201cEHS\u201d) matters) in as timely a manner and with the same level of detail as we would if we were in such a day-to-day management role.\nIf we do not manage the day-to-day operations of a joint venture, we may not have complete visibility into operational and financial systems, controls or processes, including among others, as they relate to EHS measures. We may not be able to evaluate whether such financial, operational, or EHS systems or controls are sufficiently robust or executed appropriately.\nOur businesses are subject to environmental risks that may impact our future profitability. Our businesses (including businesses in which we invest) are subject to numerous statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection. Atlantic Aviation is subject to environmental protection requirements relating to the storage, transport, pumping and transfer of fuel. Hawaii Gas is subject to risks and hazards associated with the refining, handling, storage and transportation of combustible products. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury, loss of life, damage or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage. Any losses we face could be greater than insurance levels maintained by our businesses, which could have an adverse effect on their and our financial results. In addition, disruptions to physical assets could reduce our ability to serve customers and adversely affect sales and cash flows.\nIMTT\u2019s operations in particular are subject to complex, stringent and expensive environmental regulation and future compliance costs are difficult to estimate with certainty. IMTT also faces risks relating to the handling and transportation of significant amounts of hazardous materials. Failure to comply with regulations or other claims may give rise to interruptions in operations and civil or criminal penalties and liabilities that could adversely affect the profitability of this business and the distributions it makes to us, as could significant unexpected compliance costs. Further, these rules and regulations are subject to change and compliance with any changes could result in a restriction of the activities of our businesses, significant capital expenditures and/or increased ongoing operating costs.\nA number of the properties owned by IMTT have been subject to environmental contamination in the past and require remediation for which IMTT is liable. These remediation obligations exist principally at IMTT\u2019s Bayonne and Lemont facilities and could cost more than anticipated or could be incurred earlier than anticipated, or both. In addition, IMTT may discover additional environmental contamination at its Bayonne, Lemont or other facilities that may require remediation at significant cost to IMTT. Further, the past contamination of the properties owned by IMTT, including by former owners or operators of such properties, could result in remediation obligations, personal injury, property damage, environmental damage or similar claims by third parties.\nWe may also be required to address other prior or future environmental contamination, including soil and groundwater contamination that results from the spillage of fuel, hazardous materials or other pollutants. Under various federal, state, local and foreign environmental statutes, rules and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for noncompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety requirements and for the costs of investigation, monitoring, removal or remediation of hazardous materials. These laws often impose liability, whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of those materials at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person and whether or not the original disposal or treatment activity accorded with all regulatory requirements. The presence of hazardous materials on a property could result in personal injury, loss of life, damage or destruction of property and equipment, environmental damage and/or claims by third parties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nOur income may be affected adversely if additional compliance costs are required as a result of new safety, health or environmental regulation. Our businesses are subject to federal, state and local safety, health and environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect all aspects of their operations and are frequently modified. There is a risk that any one of our businesses may not be able to comply with some aspect of these laws and regulations, resulting in fines or penalties. Additionally, if new laws and regulations are adopted or if interpretations of existing laws and regulations change, we could be required to increase capital spending and incur increased operating expenses in order to comply. Because the regulatory environment frequently changes, we cannot predict when or how we may be affected by such changes. Environmental emissions and other compliance testing technologies continue to improve, which may result in more stringent, targeted environmental regulations and compliance obligations in the future, for example at IMTT, the costs of which could be material and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur businesses are dependent on our relationships, on a contractual and regulatory level, with government entities that may have significant leverage over us. Government entities may be influenced by political considerations to take actions adverse to us. Our businesses generally are, and will continue to be, subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies. In addition, our businesses rely on obtaining and maintaining government permits, licenses, concessions, leases or contracts. Government entities, due to the wide-ranging scope of their authority, have significant leverage over us in their contractual and regulatory relationships with us that they may exercise in a manner that causes us delays in the operation of our businesses or pursuit of our strategy, or increased administrative expense. Furthermore, government permits, licenses, concessions, leases and contracts are generally very complex, which may result in periods of non-compliance, or disputes over interpretation or enforceability. If we fail to comply with these regulations or contractual obligations, we could be subject to monetary penalties or we may lose our rights to operate the affected business, or both. Where our ability to operate an infrastructure business is subject to a concession or lease from the government, the concession or lease may restrict our ability to operate the business in a way that maximizes cash flows and profitability. Further, our ability to grow our current and future businesses will often require consent of numerous government regulators. Increased regulation restricting the ownership or management of U.S. assets, particularly infrastructure assets, by non-U.S. persons, given the non-U.S. ultimate ownership of our Manager, may limit our ability to pursue acquisitions. Any such regulation may also limit our Manager\u2019s ability to\ncontinue to manage our operations, which could cause disruption to our businesses and a decline in our performance. In addition, any required government consents may be costly to seek and we may not be able to obtain them. Failure to obtain any required consents could limit our ability to achieve our growth strategy.\nOur contracts with government entities may also contain clauses more favorable to the government counterparty than a typical commercial contract. For instance, a lease, concession or general service contract may enable the government to terminate the agreement without requiring them to pay adequate compensation. In addition, government counterparties also may have the discretion to change or increase regulation of our operations, or implement laws or regulations affecting our operations, separate from any contractual rights they may have. Governments have considerable discretion in implementing regulations that could impact these businesses. Governments may be influenced by political considerations to take actions that may hinder the efficient and profitable operation of our businesses.\nMany of our contracts, especially those with government entities or quasi-government entities are long-term contracts. These long-term contracts may be difficult to replace if terminated. In addition, buy-out or other early termination provisions could adversely affect our results of operations if exercised before the end of the contract.\nGovernmental agencies may determine the prices we charge and may be able to restrict our ability to operate our businesses to maximize profitability. Where our businesses are sole or predominant service providers in their respective service areas and provide services that are essential to the community, they are likely to be subject to rate regulation by governmental agencies that will determine the prices they may charge. We may also face fees or other charges imposed by government agencies that increase our costs and over which we have no control. We may be subject to increases in fees or unfavorable price determinations that may be final with no right of appeal or that, despite a right of appeal, could result in our profits being negatively affected. In addition, we may have very little negotiating leverage in establishing contracts with government entities, which may decrease the prices that we otherwise might be able to charge or the terms upon which we provide products or services. Businesses we acquire in the future may also be subject to rate regulation or similar negotiating limitations.\nUnfavorable publicity or public perception of the industries in which we operate could adversely impact our operating results and our reputation. Accidents and incidents involving the aviation industry, particularly those involving the airports and heliport at which we operate, whether or not directly related to the Company\u2019s services, and the media coverage thereof, can adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation and the demand for our services. Similarly, negative publicity or public perception of the energy-related industries in which we operate, including through media coverage of environmental contamination and climate change concerns, could reduce demand for our services and harm our reputation. Any reduction in demand for the services our businesses provide or damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects.\nA significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the revenue of a number of our businesses. A significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the profitability of a number of our businesses. Higher prices for jet fuel could result in less use of aircraft by GA customers, which would have a negative impact on the profitability of Atlantic Aviation. Higher fuel prices could increase the cost of power to our businesses generally which they may not be able to fully pass on to customers.\nA sustained period of low energy prices may foreshadow a downturn in economic activity, and capital investment in particular, that could have a negative impact on the performance and prospects of one or more of our businesses. A period of low energy prices, or what has been characterized as an \u201coil\u201d or \u201cenergy\u201d glut, may not drive an increase in economic activity and capital investment. If instead there results in a lack of growth in economic activity and capital investment, and a slowing of the economy, demand for products and services provided by our airport services and/or bulk liquid terminal businesses may flatten or decline. A decline in the performance of these businesses could result in a decline in the value of our shares.\nEnergy efficiency and technology advances, as well as conservation efforts and changes in the sources and types of energy produced in the U.S. may result in reduced demand for our products and services. The trends toward increased conservation, as well as technological advances including installation of improved insulation, the development of more efficient heating and cooling devices and advances in energy generation technology, may reduce demand for certain of our products and services. During periods of high energy commodity costs, the prices of certain of our products and services generally increase, which may lead to customer conversation. In addition, federal and/or state regulation may require mandatory conservation measures, which would also reduce demand.\nThe discovery and development of new and unconventional energy sources in the U.S. may drive changes in related energy product logistics chains. The location and exploitation of these new energy sources could result in the dislocation of certain portions of some of our businesses. Either or both of these changes in energy supply chain logistics or trends toward increased conservation could reduce demand for our products and services and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nEach of our businesses experience a measure of seasonality and such seasonality may cause fluctuations in our results of operations. Although infrastructure business tend to produce stable financial results owing to a preponderance of contracted/concession based revenues and the provision of generally essential services, each of our businesses operates in an environment which can generate seasonal variations in results. Our bulk liquid terminals business may generate incrementally more cash during cold weather months as a result of increased heating, throughput of certain products such as heating oil or the reduction in maintenance expenses. Our aviation services business may generate relatively more cash during cold weather months as a result of increased GA traffic into bases in Florida and intermountain West. Our solar power generation facilities may generate incrementally more cash during summer months when the number of daylight hours increases. Our gas production and distribution business may generate incrementally more cash during the peak tourism periods in Hawaii between mid-December and the end of March and from mid-June through mid-September. To the extent that our businesses collectively appear to generate more cash in the first quarter of the year, such performance, if annualized, could result in an overly optimistic estimate of the value of our shares.\nSecurity breaches or interruptions in our information systems could materially adversely affect our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information used to operate our businesses. We also share certain information technology networks with our Manager. The information technology infrastructure we use, as well as the information technology systems used by our Manager, could be vulnerable to security breach, damage or interruption from computer viruses, cyber attacks, cyber terrorism, natural disasters or telecommunications failures. If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and confidential data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets. Climate change is receiving increased attention from the scientific and political communities. There is an ongoing debate as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the possible causes of this change and its potential impacts. Some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome of federal and state actions to address global climate change could result in significant new regulations, additional changes to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions. These actions could increase the costs of operating our businesses, reduce the demand for our products and services and impact the prices we charge our customers, any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, climate change could make severe weather events more frequent, which would increase the likelihood of capital expenditures to replace damaged infrastructure at our businesses.\nWe may face a greater exposure to terrorism than other companies because of the nature of our businesses. We believe that our infrastructure businesses face a greater risk of terrorist attack than other businesses, particularly our operations within the immediate vicinity of metropolitan and suburban areas. Because our businesses provide basic services relied on by many people, our facilities may be at greater risk for terrorism attacks than other businesses, which could affect its operations significantly. Any terrorist attacks that occur at or near our business locations would likely to cause significant harm to our employees and assets. In recent years, insurers have significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events. A terrorist attack that makes use of our property, or property under our control, may result in liability far in excess of available insurance coverage. In addition, any terrorist attack, regardless of location, could cause a disruption to our business and a decline in earnings. Furthermore, it is likely to result in an increase in insurance premiums and a reduction in coverage, which could cause our profitability to suffer.\nRisks Related to IMTT IMTT\u2019s business is dependent on the demand for bulk liquid terminals capacity in the locations where it operates. Demand for IMTT\u2019s bulk liquid terminals is largely a function of U.S. domestic demand for chemical, petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and, less significantly, the extent to which such products are imported into and/or exported out of the United States. U.S. domestic demand for chemical, petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products is influenced by a number of factors, including economic conditions, growth in the U.S. economy, the pricing of chemical, petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and their substitutes. Import and export volumes of these products to and from the United States are influenced by demand and supply imbalances in the United States and overseas, the cost of producing chemical, petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products domestically versus overseas and the cost of transporting the products between the United States and overseas destinations. Specifically, increased production of natural gas or crude from mainland North America or the volatility of global crude prices may increase or decrease the demand for bulk liquid terminals. This situation continues to develop and the effects are not yet predictable.\nIn addition, changes in government regulations that affect imports and exports of bulk chemical, petroleum, renewable fuels and vegetable and animal oil products, including the imposition of surcharges or taxes on imported or exported products, could adversely affect import and export volumes to and from the United States. A reduction in demand for bulk liquid terminals, particularly in NYH or the Lower Mississippi River, as a consequence of lower U.S. domestic demand for, or imports/exports of, chemical, petroleum or vegetable and animal oil products, could lead to a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented out by IMTT and adversely affect IMTT\u2019s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us.\nIMTT\u2019s business could be adversely affected by a substantial increase in bulk liquid terminals capacity in the locations where it operates or in other alternative or substitute locations. An increase in available bulk liquid terminal capacity in excess of growth in demand for such storage in the key locations in which IMTT operates, such as NYH and the Lower Mississippi River, or in Houston or other parts of the Gulf Coast could result in overcapacity and a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented out by IMTT and could adversely affect IMTT\u2019s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us.\nIf IMTT does not deploy capital for growth or make such deployment on economically acceptable terms, any future growth of the business may be limited. A portion of IMTT\u2019s historical growth has been dependent on the deployment of growth capital. We believe that there remains considerable opportunity for IMTT to deploy growth capital at levels similar to those experienced between 2006 and 2012. If IMTT cannot find projects with economically acceptable terms, future growth of this business may be limited.\nFailure to realize anticipated operational improvements following the IMTT acquisition could negatively impact our business; assumption of managerial control over IMTT will be time consuming; IMTT\u2019s business relationships may be adversely impacted by the change in ownership. We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the entire IMTT business into our ongoing operations. Integration and assumption of managerial control could be expensive and is time consuming for our management. We also may not be able to achieve anticipated financial performance of the IMTT business within our expected time frames or at all. In addition, parties with which IMTT does business, including customers, suppliers and regulatory authorities, may experience uncertainty associated with our acquisition of IMTT. As a result, IMTT\u2019s business relationships may be adversely impacted if these parties attempt to negotiate changes in existing business arrangements, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA continued or sustained decrease in the global price of crude oil and its derivative products may negatively impact IMTT\u2019s operations. A decrease in oil prices over a long period of time may cause IMTT\u2019s customers to have a lower level of demand for the services IMTT provides. Uncertainty in the oil markets may also result in IMTT\u2019s customers entering into shorter term contracts for product storage than they have previously. This would increase the frequency of customer contract renewals and negotiations and may result in more volatility in earnings. IMTT customers that are negatively impacted by reduced oil prices may seek to renegotiate contract pricing or storage capacity in order to reduce operating costs. Low oil prices may also result in a lower level of growth capital expenditures by IMTT as its customers may not require additional storage or logistics assets to be constructed, which may limit IMTT\u2019s future growth.\nSome of IMTT\u2019s current agreements may be terminated at the end of the current renewal term upon requisite notice or renewed on different terms. If one or more of the current agreements is terminated and IMTT is unable to secure comparable alternative arrangements, its financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Upon expiration, agreements can generally be terminated by either party upon the giving of the requisite notice. If any of IMTT\u2019s agreements are terminated and IMTT is unable to secure comparable alternative arrangements, IMTT may not be able to generate sufficient additional revenue from third parties to replace any shortfall. Additionally, IMTT may incur substantial costs if modifications to its terminals are required by a new or renegotiated agreement.\nIMTT could incur significant costs and liabilities in responding to contamination that occurs at its facilities. There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in IMTT\u2019s operations due to its handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes, because of air emissions, water discharges and waste practices related to its operations, and as a result of historical operations and waste disposal practices of prior owners of IMTT\u2019s facilities. IMTT\u2019s pipeline and terminal facilities have been used for transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil, refined petroleum products and chemicals for many years. Although IMTT has utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, refined petroleum products or crude oil, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes from time to time have been spilled or released on or under the terminal properties.\nIn addition, the terminal properties were previously owned and operated by other parties and those parties from time to time also have spilled or released refined petroleum products or crude oil, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes. The terminal properties are subject to federal, state and local laws that impose investigatory, corrective action and remedial obligations, some of which are joint and several or strict liability obligations without regard to fault, to address and prevent environmental contamination. IMTT may incur significant costs and liabilities in responding to any soil and groundwater contamination that occurs on its properties, even if the contamination was caused by prior owners and operators of its facilities. IMTT may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance or other sources of contractual indemnity. To\nthe extent that the costs associated with meeting any or all of these requirements are substantial and not adequately provided for, there could be a material adverse effect on IMTT\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIMTT may incur significant costs and liabilities in complying with stringent environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. IMTT\u2019s operations involve the transportation and storage of petroleum and chemical products which are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing release of materials and vapors into the environment, occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with this complex array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations is difficult and may require significant capital expenditures and operating costs to mitigate or prevent pollution. Moreover, IMTT\u2019s business is subject to accidental spills, discharges or other releases of petroleum or chemical products or other hazardous substances or wastes into the environment and neighboring areas, in which events joint and several, strict liability may be imposed against us under certain environmental laws for costs required to remediate and restore impacted properties, for claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury, natural resource and property damages, and for costs required to conduct health studies. Failure to comply with applicable environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including fines, administrative, civil or criminal penalties, and permit revocations, the imposition of investigatory, corrective action, or remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of IMTT\u2019s operations.\nNew laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, increased government enforcement or other developments could require IMTT to make additional unforeseen expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. IMTT is not able to predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations or how such legal requirements are interpreted or enforced, but any such expenditures or costs for environmental and occupational health and safety compliance could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nIMTT\u2019s business involves hazardous activities and is partly located in a region with a history of significant adverse weather events and is potentially a target for terrorist attacks. We cannot assure that IMTT is, or will be in the future, adequately insured against all such risks. The transportation, handling and storage of petroleum, chemical and vegetable and animal oil products are subject to the risk of spills, leakage, contamination, fires and explosions. Any of these events may result in loss of revenue, loss of reputation or goodwill, fines, penalties and other liabilities. In certain circumstances, such events could also require IMTT to halt or significantly alter operations at all or part of the facility at which the event occurred. IMTT carries insurance to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of the business; however, the limits of IMTT\u2019s coverage mean IMTT cannot insure against all risks. In addition, because IMTT\u2019s facilities are not insured against loss from terrorism or acts of war, such an attack that significantly damages one or more of IMTT\u2019s major facilities would have a negative impact on IMTT\u2019s future cash flow and profitability and the distributions it makes to us. Further, future losses sustained by insurers during hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf and Northeast regions may result in lower insurance coverage and/or increased insurance premiums for IMTT\u2019s properties.\nInformation about IMTT\u2019s historical operations of which we are not currently aware could cause either or both of IMTT\u2019s and our performance in the future to be different than our current expectations and such differences could be material. We own 100% of IMTT since July 16, 2014, the date of the acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, our co-investor had primary responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the business during that time. As such, we relied on the financial reporting of our co-investor, and related reviews conducted by independent auditors, with respect to the performance of the business for that period. To the extent such reporting has been in any way inaccurate or incomplete, correcting or completing the reporting could cause us to restate our financial statements for prior periods and could result in the identification of previously unknown liabilities, and may have an adverse impact on our results both historically and prospectively.\nIMTT employs systems and technology to handle and track the movements of bulk liquid products. Weaknesses in or failures to those systems and technology could result in a need to implement more robust and potentially more expensive systems.\nIMTT also employs spill prevention, containment and clean up systems. However, such systems could fail and future spills or those that may have occurred in the past could result in our having liability for remediating these at an unknown cost. Any or all of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIMTT\u2019s business could be adversely affected by the insolvency of large customers. IMTT has a number of customers that together generate a material proportion of IMTT\u2019s revenue and gross profit. In 2014, IMTT\u2019s ten largest customers by revenue generated approximately 50% of IMTT revenue. The insolvency of any of these large customers could result in an increase in unutilized storage capacity in the absence of such capacity being rented to other customers and adversely affect IMTT\u2019s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us.\nRisks Related to Atlantic Aviation Deterioration in the economy in general or in the aviation industry that results in less air traffic at airports that Atlantic Aviation services would have a material adverse impact on our business. A large part of the business\u2019 revenue is derived from fueling and other services provided to GA customers and, to a lesser extent, commercial air travelers. An economic downturn could reduce the level of air travel, adversely affecting Atlantic Aviation. GA travel is primarily a function of economic activity. Consequently, during periods of economic downturn, FBO customers are more likely to curtail air travel.\nAir travel and air traffic volume can also be affected by events that have nationwide and industry-wide implications. Events such as wars, outbreaks of disease, severe weather and terrorist activities in the United States or overseas may reduce air travel. Local circumstances include downturns in the general economic conditions of the area where an airport is located or other situations in which the business\u2019 major FBO customers relocate their home base or preferred fueling stop to alternative locations.\nIn addition, changes to regulations governing the tax treatment relating to GA travel, either for businesses or individuals, may cause a reduction in GA travel. Increased environmental regulation restricting or increasing the cost of aviation activities could also cause the business\u2019 revenue to decline.\nAtlantic Aviation is subject to a variety of competitive pressures, and the actions of competitors may have a material adverse effect on its revenue, market share, and fuel margins, causing a decline in the profitability of that business. FBO operators at a particular airport compete based on a number of factors, including location of the facility relative to runways and street access, service, value added features, reliability and price. Many of Atlantic Aviation\u2019s FBOs compete with one or more FBOs at their respective airports and with FBOs at nearby airports. Furthermore, leases related to FBO operations may be subject to competitive bidding at the end of their term. Some present and potential competitors may have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than Atlantic Aviation, which may negatively impact Atlantic Aviation\u2019s ability to compete at each airport or for lease renewal. Some competitors may aggressively or irrationally price their bids for airport concessions, which may limit the business\u2019 ability to grow or renew its portfolio. Excessive price discounting may cause fuel volume and market share decline, potential decline in hangar rentals and de-icing and may result in increased margin pressure, adversely affecting the profitability of this business.\nAtlantic Aviation\u2019s FBOs do not have the right to be the sole provider of FBO services at any airport. The authority responsible for each airport has the ability to grant other leases to other operators and new competitors could be established at those airports. The addition of new competitors may reduce or impair Atlantic Aviation\u2019s ability to grow or improve its financial performance.\nThe termination for cause or convenience of one or more of the FBO leases would damage Atlantic Aviation\u2019s operations significantly. Atlantic Aviation\u2019s revenue is derived from long-term leases at 69 airports in the U.S. If Atlantic Aviation defaults on the terms and conditions of its leases, including upon insolvency, the relevant authority may terminate the lease without compensation. In this case, Atlantic Aviation would then lose the income from that location and potentially the expected returns from prior capital expenditures. Atlantic Aviation would also likely be in default under the loan agreements and be obliged to repay its lenders a portion or the entire outstanding loan amount. Any such events would have a material adverse effect on Atlantic Aviation\u2019s results of operations.\nThe business may be exposed to sudden and extreme volatility in commodity prices directly or indirectly. Aviation fuel is generally stored on site in fuel farms. In some instances these fuel farms are owned by the FBO operator and in other instances they are owned by a third party, usually the airport or a third party fuel provider. Extreme and sudden movements in underlying commodity prices may impact the value of an FBO operator\u2019s fuel inventory as well as the margin the FBO operator earns on fuel. In addition, extreme and sudden movements in commodity prices may impact overall GA activity levels.\nFailure to complete, or realize anticipated performance from acquisitions could negatively impact Atlantic Aviation; the business\u2019 increased indebtedness after the acquisitions could reduce our operating flexibility. Completing acquisitions are subject to a number of conditions, and we may not complete our acquisitions on a timely basis or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our Atlantic Aviation business.\nFBO industry participants are often smaller, private companies with less sophisticated information systems and financial reporting and control capabilities. Acquisitions are typically privately owned and have financial reporting and control systems that are less sophisticated than ours. If we complete the acquisitions, we may be unable to integrate the assets into our existing operations on a timely basis or to achieve expected efficiencies. The integration could be expensive and could be time consuming for our management.\nWe may not be able to achieve anticipated levels of financial performance at the acquired assets within our expected time frames or at all. In addition, Atlantic Aviation has incurred indebtedness to fund a portion of the acquisitions. This increased level of indebtedness will increase interest expense and could reduce funds available for reinvestment or distribution to MIC.\nDeterioration of business jet traffic at airports where Atlantic Aviation operates would decrease Atlantic Aviation\u2019s ability to refinance or service its debt. As of December 31, 2014, Atlantic Aviation had total long-term debt outstanding of $611.3 million, consisting of $606.6 million in term loan debt and $4.7 million in stand-alone debt facilities. The terms of these debt arrangements require compliance with certain operating and financial covenants. The ability of Atlantic Aviation to meet its respective debt service obligations and to refinance or repay their outstanding indebtedness will depend primarily upon cash produced by this business.\nReductions in U.S. military spending could result in a reduction in demand for services provided by Atlantic Aviation at certain airports in the U.S. The U.S. military operates non-combat aircraft that are serviced at Atlantic Aviation FBOs around the U.S. and combat and non-combat aircraft at certain airports where fueling and fuel-related services are provided by Atlantic Aviation. Cuts in U.S. military spending, to the extent they result in a reduction in the number of flights by military aircraft, could reduce revenue at Atlantic Aviation.\nRegulators, such as The Transportation Security Administration (or TSA), have and may continue to consider new regulations which could impair the relative convenience of GA and adversely affect demand for Atlantic Aviation\u2019s services. The business believes that new regulations, if implemented, could affect Atlantic Aviation, its customers and the airports at which it operates. Such rules could decrease the convenience and attractiveness of GA travel relative to commercial air travel and, therefore, may adversely impact demand for Atlantic Aviation\u2019s services.\nThe lack of accurate and reliable industry data can result in unfavorable strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions and macro pricing decisions. The business uses industry and airport-specific GA traffic data published by the FAA to identify trends in the FBO industry. The business also uses this traffic data as a key input to decision-making in strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions and macro pricing matters. However, as noted by the FAA on their website, the data has several limitations and challenges. As a result, the use of the FAA traffic data may result in conclusions in strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions or macro pricing decisions that are ultimately sub-optimal.\nRisks Related to CP&E CP&E depends on counterparties performing in accordance with their agreements. If they fail to so perform, our CP&E businesses could incur substantial losses of revenue or additional expenses and business disruptions. CP&E is exposed to the risk that counterparties under long-term agreements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements. Should they fail to so perform, CP&E may be required to seek alternative purchasers of the power produced by our CP&E facilities. The failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could adversely affect CP&E\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe generation of electricity from our solar and wind power generation facilities is dependent on meteorological conditions. If conditions are unfavorable, CP&E\u2019s generation facilities may underperform which could materially adversely affect CP&E\u2019s financial condition, cash flows and result of operations. Certain of CP&E\u2019s power generation facilities are dependent on the available solar and wind resources. Historical solar insolation and wind speed data, combined with computer modeling, is used to project expected power generation. Actual conditions are beyond our control and may vary from our projections. If actual conditions cause material underperformance, CP&E\u2019s result of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. This may cause a default under some or all of CP&E\u2019s debt facilities and/or limit CP&E\u2019s ability to pay distributions to MIC.\nCP&E depends on electric interconnection and transmission facilities that we do not own or control and that are potentially subject to transmission constraints. If these facilities fail to provide adequate transmission capacity, CP&E may be restricted in its ability to deliver electricity to customers. CP&E depends on electric interconnection and transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the power it generates under specific contracts agreed with CP&E. Within certain of these contracts, there are provisions that allow for occasional curtailment of electricity generated by CP&E due to the limitations of the transmission system or electricity grid. Any constraints on, or the failure of, interconnections or transmission facilities could prevent CP&E from selling power and could adversely affect CP&E\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nSome of our generating capacity and/or the associated attributes of our facilities are not contracted and the price at which we can sell electricity and related products and services may be impacted by price fluctuations in the wholesale power and energy markets. Market prices for electric generation, capacity and ancillary services are unpredictable and may fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other commodities, power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally\nmust be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets. CP&E\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be impacted by lower prices for wholesale power.\nMaintenance, expansion and refurbishment of power generation facilities involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output. Our facilities may require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and forced outages, and any decreased operational or management performance, could reduce our facilities\u2019 generating capacity or generation below expected levels, reducing our revenues. Degradation of the performance of our facilities above levels provided for in the related PPAs may also reduce our revenues. Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading or repairing our facilities may also reduce profitability. Any of these factors could adversely affect CP&E\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nLaws, governmental regulations and policies supporting renewable energy, and specifically solar and wind energy (including tax incentives), could change at any time, including as a result of new political leadership, and such changes may materially adversely affect our business and our growth strategy. Renewable generation assets currently benefit from various federal, state and local governmental incentives. In the United States, these incentives include investment tax credits, or \u201cITCs,\u201d cash grants in lieu of ITCs, loan guarantees, RPS programs, modified accelerated cost-recovery system of depreciation and bonus depreciation. In addition, many U.S. states have adopted RPS programs mandating that a specified percentage of electricity sales come from eligible sources of renewable energy. If these government incentives or RPS requirements are reduced or eliminated, it could lead to fewer future power contracts or lead to lower prices for the sale of power in future power contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on future projects.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fuel price volatility and interruptions in supplies. Under certain future PPAs, we may be responsible for the purchase of fuel and face the risks of supply interruptions and fuel price volatility, as fuel deliveries may not exactly match those required for energy sales.\nCP&E acquisitions or future expansions of existing businesses may expose us to development risk. We may acquire CP&E businesses or invest additional capital in existing facilities that requires the development of new CP&E projects or facilities and exposes us to the project development risks associated with new power projects. These risks may include excessive delays or costs related to obtaining necessary permits and approvals, environmental remediation costs, technology failures, counterparty contract and construction risk, any or all of which may adversely affect the operational and financial performance of the business.\nWe may not be able to replace expiring PPAs or tolling agreements with contracts on similar terms. If we are unable to replace an expired contract with an acceptable new contract, we may experience lower than anticipated revenues. We may not be able to replace an expiring PPA or tolling arrangement with a contract on equivalent terms and conditions, including at prices that permit operation of the related facility on a profitable basis. If we are unable to replace an expiring contract, the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations. In the case of a facility that ceases operations, the PPA may require that we remove the assets, including fixing or reimbursing the site owner for any damages caused by the assets or the removal of such assets. Alternatively, we may agree to sell the assets to the site owner, but we can offer no assurances as to the terms and conditions, including price, that we would receive in any sale, and the sale price may not be sufficient to replace the revenue previously generated by the project.\nCP&E\u2019s failure to uphold its obligations as managing member at the relevant facilities could materially adversely affect CP&E\u2019s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As managing member, CP&E is obligated to perform certain actions, including providing certain reporting items to its co-investor and the filing of correct and timely tax returns. As managing member, CP&E\nis also obligated to refrain from performing certain actions, including selling its interest to certain entities that would result in adverse economic outcomes to CP&E and its co-investor due to tax regulations. If CP&E were to cause an adverse tax outcome for its co-investor, CP&E could be liable. CP&E\u2019s failure to perform its obligations or to take any actions contrary to its obligations under any or all operating LLC agreements could adversely affect CP&E\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Hawaii Gas Hawaii Gas is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices that have a history of price volatility. To the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers, both in the short-term or the long-term, the business\u2019 gross profit and cash flows will be adversely affected. The profitability of Hawaii Gas is based on the margin of sales prices over costs. Since LPG and feedstock for the SNG plant are commodities, changes in global supply of and demand for these products can have a significant impact on costs. In addition, increased reliance on off-island sources of LPG, whether as a result of disruptions to or shortages in local sources or otherwise, could also have a significant impact on costs. Hawaii Gas has no control over these costs, and, to the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers, the business\u2019 financial condition and the results of operations would be adversely affected. Higher prices could result in reduced customer demand or customer conversion to alternative energy sources, or both, that would reduce the volume of gas sold and adversely affect the profitability of Hawaii Gas.\nChanges in commodity market prices may have a negative effect on our liquidity. Depending on the terms of our contracts with suppliers as well as our use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in the cost of LPG, changes in the market price of LPG can create payment obligations for us and expose us to an increased liquidity risk.\nHawaii Gas is subject to risks associated with volatility in the Hawaii economy. Tourism and government activities (including the military) are two of the largest components of Hawaii\u2019s economy. Hawaii\u2019s economy is heavily influenced by economic conditions in the U.S. and Asia and their impact on tourism, as well as by government spending. A large portion of Hawaii Gas\u2019s sales are generated by businesses that rely on tourism. If the local economy deteriorates, the volume of gas sold could be negatively affected by business closures and/or lower usage and adversely impact the business\u2019 financial performance. Additionally, a lack of growth in the Hawaiian economy could reduce the level of new residential construction, and adversely impact growth in volume from new residential customers. A reduction in government activity, particularly military activity, or a shift by either away from the use of gas, could also have a negative impact on Hawaii Gas\u2019s results.\nDisruptions or shutdowns at either of the oil refineries on Oahu from which Hawaii Gas obtains both LPG and the primary feedstock for its SNG plant may have an adverse effect on the operations of the business. Hawaii Gas processes SNG and distributes SNG and LPG. SNG feedstock or LPG supply disruptions could increase Hawaii Gas\u2019s costs as a result of an inability to source feedstock at rates comparable to those being paid currently. The extended unavailability of one or both of the refineries or disruption to crude oil supplies or feedstock to Hawaii could also result in an increased reliance on off-island sources. An inability to purchase LPG from off-island sources would adversely affect operations. The business is also limited in its ability to store LPG, and any disruption in supply may cause a depletion of LPG stocks. All supply disruptions of SNG or LPG, if occurring for an extended period, could adversely impact the business\u2019s contribution margin and cash flows.\nHawaii Gas relies on its SNG plant, including its transmission pipeline, for a significant portion of its sales. Disruptions at that facility could adversely affect the business\u2019 ability to serve customers. Disruptions at the SNG plant resulting from mechanical or operational problems or power failures could affect the ability of Hawaii Gas to produce SNG. Most of the utility sales on Oahu are of SNG and all SNG is produced at the Oahu plant. Disruptions to the primary and redundant production systems would have a significant adverse effect on Hawaii Gas\u2019s revenues and cash flows.\nThe operations of Hawaii Gas are subject to a variety of competitive pressures and the actions of competitors, particularly those involved in other energy sources, could have a materially adverse effect on operating results. Other fuel sources such as electricity, diesel, solar energy, geo-thermal, wind, other gas providers and alternative energy sources may be substituted for certain gas end-use applications, particularly if the price of gas increases relative to other fuel sources, whether due to higher costs or otherwise. Customers could, for a number of reasons, including increased gas prices, lower costs of alternative energy or convenience, meet their energy needs through alternative sources. This could have an adverse effect on the business\u2019 revenues and cash flows.\nThe proposed merger of Hawaii Electric Industries and NextEra Energy could create delays in the review of Hawaii Gas\u2019s pending and future regulatory filings or result in a less favorable competitive landscape. The proposed merger, announced in December of 2014, contemplates the largest energy transaction in state history and its review will require a significant portion of Hawaii\u2019s regulatory resources. To the extent this delays the timely review of current or future Hawaii Gas regulatory filings, this may have an adverse impact on the business\u2019 revenues and cash flows. Further, to the extent that the merged companies are permitted to further vertically integrate into fuel supply, this could also result in an adverse impact on the business\u2019 revenues and cash flows.\nHawaii Gas\u2019s utility business is subject to regulation by the HPUC and actions by the HPUC or changes to the regulatory environment may constrain the operation or profitability of the business. The HPUC regulates all franchised or certificated public service companies operating in Hawaii; prescribes rates, tariffs, charges and fees; determines the allowable rate of earnings in establishing rates; issues guidelines concerning the general management of franchised or certificated utility businesses; and acts on requests for the acquisition, sale, disposition or other exchange of utility properties, including mergers and consolidations.\nAny adverse decision by the HPUC concerning the level or method of determining utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in the rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding, could have an adverse effect on the business.\nAs part of MIC\u2019s acquisition, the business agreed to 14 regulatory conditions with the HPUC that address a variety of matters including: a requirement that Hawaii Gas and HGC\u2019s ratio of consolidated debt to total capital does not exceed 65%; and a requirement to maintain $20.0 million in readily-available cash resources at Hawaii Gas, HGC or MIC. The business is currently in compliance with these conditions, however, future non-compliance with these or other HPUC regulatory conditions, could adversely impact the profitability of Hawaii Gas.\nHawaii Gas\u2019s operations on the islands of Hawaii, Maui and Kauai rely on LPG that is transported to those islands by Jones Act qualified barges from Oahu and from non-Jones Act vessels from off-island ports. Disruptions to service by those vessels could adversely affect the financial performance of the business. The Jones Act requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried in U.S.-flag ships and that they meet certain other requirements. The business has time charter agreements allowing the use of two barges that currently have a cargo capacity of approximately 420,000 gallons and 500,000 gallons of LPG, respectively. The barges used by the business are the only two Jones Act qualified barges available in the Hawaiian Islands capable of carrying large volumes of LPG. If the barges are unable to transport LPG from Oahu and the business is not able to secure off-island sources of LPG or obtain an exemption to the Jones Act that would permit importation of a sufficient quantity of LPG from the mainland U.S., the profitability of the business could be adversely impacted. If the barges require refurbishment or repair at a greater frequency than forecast, cash outflows for capital costs could adversely impact Hawaii Gas\u2019s results and cash flows.\nThe RNG and LNG initiatives expose Hawaii Gas to new supply, counterparty, facility, technology and regulatory risks. Hawaii Gas continues to evaluate a range of RNG sources for conversion into pipeline quality gas in scale quantities. These initiatives include ongoing commercial negotiations to source bio gas from waste water treatment plants, landfills and biomass. The source gas for these projects is often controlled, directly or indirectly, by state or municipal government, thereby requiring extended procurement processes which may delay the business\u2019s plans for implementation. Beginning March 31, 2012, Hawaii Gas must report annually to the HPUC the percentage of feedstock and quantity of gas produced from non-petroleum feedstock. In the event Hawaii Gas\u2019s RNG initiatives face procurement delays, regulators could impose a renewable portfolio standard on the business, resulting in significantly increased energy costs to the business and its customers.\nHawaii Gas has invested over $4.0 million to evaluate and plan for LNG transport from the mainland and utilization by the business, as well as to commence training and development of systems required for regulatory approval. This project is subject to ongoing implementation risk including but not limited to: the timely issuance of necessary permits, licenses and approvals by governmental agencies and third parties; unanticipated changes in market demand or supply; competition with similar projects; site difficulties; environmental conditions; delays of critical equipment and materials; and commercial arrangements to transport and distribute LNG. If the project is delayed beyond the estimated implementation period, the actual cost of planning and implementation may increase beyond the amounts currently estimated in our capital and operating budgets. A delay in implementation would also cause a delay in the receipt of projected revenues, which may cause our financial results to be negatively impacted.\nReductions in U.S. military spending could result in a reduction in demand for gas in Hawaii. The U.S. military has a significant presence in Hawaii. To the extent that federal spending cuts, including voluntary or mandatory cuts in U.S. military spending, result in a reduced military presence in Hawaii, such reductions could reduce the demand for gas in Hawaii.\nBecause of its geographic location, Hawaii, and in turn Hawaii Gas, is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks that could materially disrupt operations. Hawaii is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks, such as hurricanes, floods, heavy and sustained rains and tidal waves. Because the business\u2019 SNG plant, SNG transmission line and several storage facilities are close to the ocean, weather-related disruptions to operations are possible. In addition, earthquakes may cause disruptions. These events could damage the business\u2019 assets or could result in wide-spread damage to its customers, thereby reducing the volumes of gas sold and, to the extent such damages are not covered by insurance, the business\u2019 revenues and cash flows.\nBecause of its geographic location and the unique economy of Hawaii, Hawaii Gas is subject to challenges in hiring and maintaining staff with specialized skill sets. The changing nature of the Hawaii energy complex has had an impact on the Company\u2019s staffing requirements. Volatility in feedstock prices, together with the impact of the State of Hawaii\u2019s goals to reduce dependency on imported petroleum, requires staff with specialized knowledge of the energy sector. Because the resident labor pool in Hawaii is both small, and oriented mainly to Hawaii\u2019s basic industries, it is difficult to find individuals with these specialized skill sets. Moreover, relocation to Hawaii is costly and often requires employees to make cultural and family adjustments not normally required for a change of employment. The inability to source and retain staff with appropriate skill sets could adversely impact the performance of the business.\nRisks Related to Having an External Manager We are subject to the terms and conditions of the Management Services Agreement between the Company and our Manager. We cannot unilaterally amend the Management Services Agreement between ourselves and our Manager. Changes in the compensation of our Manager, certain rights held by the Manager or other components of the Agreement require the approval of our Manager and may limit our ability to make changes that could be beneficial to shareholders generally.\nOur Manager owns a significant portion of MIC\u2019s shares outstanding. A sale of all or a portion of the shares owned by our Manager could be interpreted by the equity markets as a lack of confidence in the prospects of the Company. Our Manager, in its sole discretion, determines whether to reinvest base and performance fees in shares and whether to hold or sell those securities. Reinvestment of base and performance fees in additional shares would increase our Manager\u2019s ownership stake in the Company. As of February 18, 2015, our Manager owned 6.75% of our outstanding shares. If our Manager decides, for reasons other than the performance and prospects of the Company, to reduce its position in the Company, such sales may be interpreted by some market participants as a lack of confidence in the Company and put downward pressure on the market price of our shares. Sales of shares by our Manager could increase the available supply and decrease the price if such sales are not made in an orderly fashion.\nCertain provisions of the management services agreement and the operating agreement of the Company make it difficult for third parties to acquire control of the Company and could deprive investors of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for their shares. In addition to the limited circumstances in which our Manager can be terminated under the terms of the management services agreement, the management services agreement provides that in circumstances where the stock ceases to be listed on a recognized U.S. exchange as a result of the acquisition of stock by third parties in an amount that results in the stock ceasing to meet the distribution and trading criteria on such exchange or market, the Manager has the option to either propose an alternate fee structure and remain our Manager or resign, terminate the management services agreement upon 30 days\u2019 written notice and be paid a substantial termination fee. The termination fee payable on the Manager\u2019s exercise of its right to resign as our Manager subsequent to a delisting of our shares could delay or prevent a change in control that may favor our shareholders. Furthermore, in the event of such a delisting, any proceeds from the sale, lease or exchange of a significant amount of assets must be reinvested in new assets of our Company, subject to debt repayment obligations. We would also be prohibited from incurring any new indebtedness or engaging in any transactions with shareholders of the Company or its affiliates without the prior written approval of the Manager. These provisions could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize a premium on the shares owned by them.\nThe operating agreement of the Company, which we refer to as the LLC agreement, contains a number of provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or discouraging a third-party from acquiring, control of the Company. These provisions include:\n\u2022 restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to enter into certain transactions with our major shareholders, with the exception of our Manager, modeled on the limitation contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law;\n\u2022 allowing only the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to fill vacancies, including newly created directorships and requiring that directors may be removed only for cause and by a shareholder vote of 66 2/3%;\n\u2022 requiring that only the Company\u2019s chairman or Board of Directors may call a special meeting of our shareholders;\n\u2022 prohibiting shareholders from taking any action by written consent;\n\u2022 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our shareholders at a shareholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022 having a substantial number of additional shares authorized but unissued; and\n\u2022 providing the Company\u2019s Board of Directors with broad authority to amend the LLC agreement.\nOur Manager\u2019s decision to reinvest its monthly base management fees and quarterly performance fees, as applicable, in shares or retain the cash will affect shareholders differently. Our Manager earned $46.6 million and $121.5 million in base management and performance fees, respectively, during 2014. These fees are based on the Company\u2019s market capitalization and performance and\nmay be higher or lower than these levels in the future. Our Manager, in its sole discretion, may elect to retain base management fees and performance fees, if applicable, paid in cash or to reinvest such payments in additional shares. In the event the Manager chooses not to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional shares, the amount paid will reduce the cash that may otherwise be distributed as a dividend to all shareholders or used in the Company\u2019s operations. In the event the Manager chooses to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional shares, effectively returning the cash to us, such reinvestment will dilute existing shareholders by the increase in the percentage of shares owned by the Manager. Either option may adversely impact the market for our shares.\nIn addition, the Manager has typically elected to invest its fees in shares, and, unless otherwise agreed with MIC, can only change this election during an 18-trading day window following the Company\u2019s earnings release. Any change would apply to fees paid thereafter. Accordingly, shareholders would generally have notice of the Manager\u2019s intent to receive fees in cash rather than reinvest before the change was effective.\nOur Manager can resign with 90 days notice, or our CEO or CFO could be removed by the Manager, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations, which could adversely affect our financial results and negatively impact the market price of our shares. Our Manager has the right, under the management services agreement, to resign at any time with 90 days notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. The resignation of our Manager will trigger mandatory repayment obligations under debt facilities at certain of our operating companies. In addition, the Manager could re-assign or remove the CEO and/or the CFO from their positions and responsibilities at the Company without the Board\u2019s approval and with little or no notice. If our Manager resigns or our CEO/CFO are removed, we may not be able to find a new external manager or hire internal management with similar expertise within 90 days to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial results could be adversely affected, perhaps materially, and the market price of our shares may decline substantially. In addition, the coordination of our internal management, acquisition activities and supervision of our businesses are likely to suffer if we were unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our Manager and its affiliates.\nFurthermore, if our Manager resigns, the Company and its subsidiaries will be required to cease use of the Macquarie brand entirely, and change their names to remove any reference to \u201cMacquarie\u201d. This may cause the value of the Company and the market price of our shares to decline.\nOur externally managed model may not be viewed favorably by investors. Our Company is externally managed by a member of the Macquarie Group. Our Manager receives a fee for its services that provides for a number of corporate center functions including the compensation of our management team and those who provide services to the Company on a shared basis, health and welfare benefits, the provision of facilities, technology and insurance (other than Directors and Officers). The fee is based on the market capitalization of the Company and thus increases as the Company grows. The size of the fee may bear no direct correlation with the actual cost of providing the agreed upon services and may be higher than the cost of managing the Company internally. Per the terms of the Management Services Agreement with our Manager, the default manner for satisfying any base or performance fees to which the Manager may be entitled is the issuance of additional shares. To the extent the fee continues to be satisfied with the delivery of additional shares, all shareholders are diluted and our hurdle for growing distributable cash on a per share basis will be higher.\nOur Manager\u2019s affiliation with Macquarie Group Limited and the Macquarie Group may result in conflicts of interest or a decline in our stock price. Our Manager is an affiliate of Macquarie Group Limited and a member of the Macquarie Group. From time to time, we have entered into, and in the future we may enter into, transactions and relationships involving Macquarie Group Limited, its affiliates, or other members of the Macquarie Group. Such transactions have included and may include, among other things, the entry into debt facilities and derivative\ninstruments with members of the Macquarie Group serving as lender or counterparty, and financial advisory or equity underwriting services provided to us by the Macquarie Group.\nAlthough our audit committee, all of the members of which are independent directors, is required to approve of any related party transactions, including those involving members of the Macquarie Group or its affiliates, the relationship of our Manager to the Macquarie Group may result in conflicts of interest.\nIn addition, as a result of our Manager\u2019s being a member of the Macquarie Group, negative market perceptions of Macquarie Group Limited generally or of Macquarie\u2019s infrastructure management model, or Macquarie Group statements or actions with respect to other managed vehicles, may affect market perceptions of our Company and cause a decline in the price of our shares unrelated to our financial performance and prospects.\nIn the event of the underperformance of our Manager, we may be unable to remove our Manager, which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our shares. Under the terms of the management services agreement, our Manager must significantly underperform in order for the management services agreement to be terminated. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors cannot remove our Manager unless:\n\u2022 our shares underperform a weighted average of two benchmark indices by more than 30% in relative terms and more than 2.5% in absolute terms in 16 out of 20 consecutive quarters prior to and including the most recent full quarter, and the holders of a minimum of 66.67% of the outstanding shares (excluding any shares owned by our Manager or any affiliate of the Manager) vote to remove our Manager;\n\u2022 our Manager materially breaches the terms of the management services agreement and such breach continues unremedied for 60 days after notice;\n\u2022 our Manager acts with gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of its duties in carrying out its obligations under the management services agreement, or engages in fraudulent or dishonest acts; or\n\u2022 our Manager experiences certain bankruptcy events.\nBecause our Manager\u2019s performance is measured by the market performance of our shares relative to a benchmark index, even if the absolute market performance of our shares does not meet expectations, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors cannot remove our Manager unless the market performance of our shares also significantly underperforms the benchmark index. If we were unable to remove our Manager in circumstances where the absolute market performance of our shares does not meet expectations, the market price of our shares could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock Our reported Earnings per Share (\u201cEPS\u201d), as defined under GAAP, do not reflect the cash generated by our businesses and may result in unfavorable comparisons with other businesses for which EPS is a useful component in valuation. Our businesses own and invest in high-value, long-lived assets that generate large amounts of depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that serve to reduce reported EPS. As a result, our financial performance may appear to be substantially worse compared with businesses whose earnings do not reflect the effects of depreciation and amortization (or other non-cash items). To the extent that our results appear to be worse, we may have relatively greater difficulty attracting investors in our stock.\nOur inability, under GAAP, to consolidate the financial results of certain of our investments may make it relatively more difficult to analyze the cash generating capacity of our combined businesses. We may make investments in certain businesses which we will be required to account for using the equity method rather than consolidate with the results of our other businesses. The equity method requires us\nto include the portion of the net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, equal to our equity interest in the business in our consolidated statement of operations. The physical asset backed nature of the businesses in which we invest (and the higher levels of non-cash expenses including depreciation and amortization) may mean that the performance of these investments have relatively little impact on our consolidated statement of operations and may not be reflected in the valuation of our shares.\nWe report dividends, whether treated as dividends or returns of capital for federal income tax purposes, on Form 1099, but could report on Schedule K-1 in the future. Our Company is structured as a Limited Liability Company that has made an election to be treated as a regular corporation for tax purposes. We report distributions to shareholders on Form 1099, either in Box 1 as a dividend or in Box 3 as a return of capital, depending on the level of earnings and profits generated in the reporting period. We may not always be or be treated as a corporation in which case distributions may be reported on another tax form including possibly Schedule K-1. Certain investors may not wish to or may be precluded from investing in an entity that reports on Schedule K-1 thus limiting the market for our shares.\nOur total assets include a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. The write-off of a significant portion of intangible assets would negatively affect our reported earnings. Our total assets reflect a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. At December 31, 2014, goodwill and other intangible assets, net, represented approximately 44.6% of total assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were primarily recognized as a result of the acquisitions of our businesses. Other intangible assets consist primarily of airport operating rights, customer relationships and trade names. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there has been any impairment in the value of goodwill and assess for impairment of other intangible assets when there are triggering events or circumstances. If the carrying value of the tested asset exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred. In this event, the amount is written down to fair value. Under current accounting rules, this would result in a charge to reported earnings. We have recognized significant impairments in the past, and any future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our reported earnings and total capitalization, and could be material.\nOur total assets include a substantial amount of intangible assets and fixed assets. The depreciation and amortization of these assets may negatively impact our reported earnings. The high level of intangible and physical assets written up to fair value upon acquisition of our businesses generates substantial amounts of depreciation and amortization. These non-cash items serve to lower net income as reported in our consolidated statement of operations as well as our taxable income. The generation of net losses or relatively small net income may contribute to a net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforward that can be used to offset current taxable income in future periods. However, the continued reporting of little or negative net income may adversely affect the attractiveness of the Company among some potential investors and may reduce the market for our shares.\nThe market price and marketability of our shares may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings. The market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly. Many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price and marketability of our shares and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity financings. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of Macquarie Group Limited and/or vehicles managed by the Macquarie Group or branded under the Macquarie name or logo;\n\u2022 significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered investment companies, business development companies or companies in our sectors, which may not be related to the operating performance of these companies;\n\u2022 changes in our earnings or variations in operating results;\n\u2022 any shortfall in EBITDA excluding non-cash items or Free Cash Flow from levels expected by securities analysts;\n\u2022 changes in regulatory policies or tax law;\n\u2022 operating performance of companies comparable to us; and\n\u2022 loss of funding sources.\nRisks Related to Taxation We have significant NOL Carryforwards that may be fully utilized over the next several years thereby subjecting us to payment of substantial federal income taxes and reducing our distributable Free Cash Flow. We may, without the acquisition of businesses with NOLs, payment of performance fees or implementation of other strategies that provide us with additional tax shield, fully utilize our existing NOLs before we anticipate or have previously indicated. At that point we may be subject to federal income taxes in consolidation and any liability could be material. Any liability will reduce distributable Free Cash Flow and could prevent the growth or reduce the rate of growth of our dividends.\nThe current treatment of qualified dividend income and long-term capital gains under current U.S. federal income tax law may be adversely affected, changed or repealed in the future. Under current law, qualified dividend income and long-term capital gains are taxed to non-corporate investors at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. In addition, certain holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are subject to 3.8% surtax on all or a portion of their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which may include all or a portion of their dividend income and net gains from the disposition of our shares. This tax treatment may be adversely affected, changed or repealed by future changes in tax laws at any time, which may affect market perceptions of our Company and the market price of our shares could be negatively affected.\nOur ability to use our NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation, such as the Company) that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income. Generally speaking, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if the aggregate percentage ownership of the stock of the corporation held by one or more \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) increases by more than fifty percentage points over such shareholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, which is generally the three year-period ending on the transaction date. If we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs and certain other tax attributes could be limited.\nWe have significant income tax NOLs, which may not be realized before they expire. We have $250.7 million in federal NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2014. While we have concluded that all of the NOLs will more likely than not be realized, there can be no assurance that we will utilize the NOLs generated to date or any NOLs we might generate in the future. In addition, we have incurred state NOLs and have provided a valuation allowance against a portion of those. As with our federal NOLs, there is also no assurance that we will utilize those state losses or future losses that may be generated. Further, the State of Illinois has suspended the use of NOL carryforwards through 2014, similar to the State of California\u2019s suspension of an NOL deduction through 2011 for large corporations. There can be no assurance that other states will not suspend the use of NOL carryforwards or that California and Illinois will not extend the suspension of the use of NOL carryforwards.\nThe treatment of depreciation and other tax deductions under current U.S. federal income tax law may be adversely affected, changed or repealed in the future. Under current law, certain capital expenditures are eligible for accelerated depreciation, including 50% bonus depreciation for assets placed in service prior to December 31, 2014, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. In addition, certain other expenses are eligible to be deducted for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This tax treatment may be adversely affected, changed or repealed by future changes in tax laws at any time, which may affect market perceptions of our Company and the market price of our shares could be negatively affected.", "PERMNO": 90507, "SIC": 4581, "TIC": "MIC"}
