{"cik": "1425205", "company": "Lion Biotechnologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below may not be the only ones relating to our company. Additional risks that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial conditions and future prospects and the trading price of our Common Stock could be harmed as a result of any of these risks. Investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes, and our other filings from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses; we expect to continue to incur losses and we may never be profitable.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $76.8 million. In addition, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred a net loss of $12.2 million. Since our inception we have not generated any revenues. We do not expect to generate any meaningful product sales or royalty revenues for the foreseeable future, if ever. We expect to incur significant additional operating losses in the future as we expand development and clinical trial efforts.\nOur ability to achieve long-term profitability is dependent upon obtaining regulatory approvals for our products and successfully commercializing our products alone or with third parties. However, our operations may not be profitable even if any of our products under development are successfully developed and produced and thereafter commercialized.\nOur research and development efforts are to a large extent dependent upon the CRADA.\nAlthough we opened our own research and development laboratory in 2014, we have limited internal research and development capabilities. As a result, we conduct a large portion of our research and development under the CRADA we entered into with the NCI. Under the CRADA, the NCI currently engaged in research and development related to the development of improved methods of large scale TIL generation for the ACT treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, bladder, lung, triple-negative breast, and HPV-associated cancers. We are obligated to make annual payments of $2,000,000 under the CRADA. In addition, although the CRADA has a five year term, either party to the CRADA has the right to terminate the CRADA upon 60 days\u2019 notice to the other party. As a result, no assurance can be given that the NCI will not terminate the CRADA in the future and that the CRADA will, therefore, remain in effect until we complete our desired research thereunder.\nWe expect to use the results of the NCI\u2019s clinical trials to support the filing with the FDA of investigational new drug applications, or INDs, to conduct more advanced clinical trials of LN-144 and additional product candidates. However, we have limited control over the nature or timing of the NCI\u2019s clinical trials and limited visibility into their day-to-day activities. The research we are funding constitutes only a small portion of the NCI\u2019s overall research. Other research being conducted by Dr. Rosenberg may at times receive higher priority than research on our programs. These factors could adversely affect the timing of our IND filings and our ability to conduct future planned clinical trials.\nUnder the CRADA, we have an option to negotiate commercialization licenses from the NIH to intellectual property relating to TIL-based product candidates developed in the course of the CRADA research plan. However, we would have to negotiate with the NIH for such a license. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully complete such negotiations and ultimately acquire the rights to the intellectual property surrounding the additional product candidates that we may seek to acquire. Further, to the extent we would like to negotiate a license to a patent filed before the CRADA was entered into, another party may object to the NIH granting us a license during a 30-day public notification period, and the NIH may decide not to grant us the license.\nWe have limited experience in operating our current business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business plan and our prospects.\nUntil March 2010, we were an inactive company known as Freight Management Corp. In 2010 and 2011, we pursued the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer based on the anti-CD55+ antibodies. However, test results from the studies performed for us as part of the anti-CD55+ antibody program failed to meet the pre-clinical development endpoints, and in 2011 we terminated these efforts. In 2011 we entered in our current line of business and entered into the NIH License Agreement, the CRADA and the manufacturing services agreement with Lonza Walkersville, Inc. As a result, we have only a limited operating history in our current line of business on which a decision to invest in our company can be based. The future of our company currently is dependent upon our ability to implement our new business plan, as that business plan may be modified from time to time by our new management. While we believe that we have a sound business plan and research and development strategy, we have only a limited operating history against which we can test our plans and assumptions, and investors therefore cannot evaluate the likelihood of our success.\nWe face the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays normally associated with a small, new biotechnology company, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our prospects should be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a new business developing new technologies in an industry that characterized by a number of market entrants and intense competition. Because of our size and limited resources, we may not possess the ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies involved in the new and rapidly evolving field of biotechnology in general, and in cancer treatment in particular. If our research and development efforts are successful, we may also face the risks associated with the shift from development to commercialization of new products based on innovative technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing our new business.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials, or may not be able to conduct our trials on the timelines we expect.\nClinical testing is expensive, time consuming, and subject to uncertainty. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. We expect to initiate our first company sponsored clinical trial later in 2015 and intend to file with the FDA several new INDs for product candidates in the next two years. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs at this rate, and we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. Moreover, even if these trials begin, issues may arise that could suspend or terminate such clinical trials. A failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing, and our future clinical studies may not be successful. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n\u2022 inability to generate sufficient preclinical data to support the initiation of clinical studies;\n\u2022 delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design;\n\u2022 the FDA may not allow us to use the clinical trial data from a research institution to support an IND if we cannot demonstrate the comparability of our product candidates with the product candidate used by the relevant research institution in its clinical studies;\n\u2022 delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical study sites;\n\u2022 delays in obtaining required Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical study site;\n\u2022 imposition of a temporary or permanent clinical hold by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022 delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our clinical studies;\n\u2022 failure by our CROs, other third parties, or us to adhere to clinical study requirements;\n\u2022 failure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, requirements, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n\u2022 patients dropping out of a study;\n\u2022 occurrence of adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;\n\u2022 changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u2022 changes in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials;\n\u2022 the cost of clinical studies of our product candidates being greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022 clinical studies of our product candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in our deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical studies or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022 transfer of manufacturing processes from the NCI to Lonza or other larger-scale facilities operated by a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, and delays or failure by our CMOs or us to make any necessary changes to such manufacturing process; and\n\u2022 delays in manufacturing, testing, releasing, validating, or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical studies or the inability to do any of the foregoing.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may be required to or we may elect to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nThe deviations in our proposed new products from existing products may require us to perform additional testing, which will increase the cost, and extend the time for obtaining approval.\nOur TIL based therapy is based on the ACT technology that we licensed from the NIH and that is presently available as a physician-sponsored investigational therapy for the treatment of Stage IV metastatic melanoma in the U.S. at the National Cancer Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer & Research Institute. The current method of treatment is very labor intensive and expensive, which has limited its widespread application. We developing new processes that we anticipate will enable more efficient manufacturing of our products. We may have difficulty demonstrating that the new products produced from our new processes are identical to the existing products. The FDA may require additional clinical testing before permitting a larger clinical trial with the new processes, and also the new product may not be as efficacious in the new clinical trials. Cellular products are not considered as well characterized products because there are hundreds of markers present on these cells, and even small changes in manufacturing processes could alter the cell types. It is unclear at this time which of those markers are critical for success of these cells to combat cancer, so our ability to predict the outcomes with newer manufacturing processes is limited. The changes that we may make to the existing manufacturing process may require additional testing, which may increase costs and timelines associated with these developments.\nIn addition to developing a TIL based therapy on existing ACT technology, we are currently evaluating the desirability of conducting clinical trials of our products in combination with other existing drugs for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. These combination therapies will require additional testing and clinical trials will require additional FDA regulatory approval and will increase our future cost of expenses.\nWe will need additional financing in order to complete the development and commercialization of our various product candidates.\nOur research and development and our operating costs have been substantial and are expected to increase. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to continue the clinical development of LN-144 and our other product candidates. As of December 30, 2014, we had $44.9 million in cash. The net proceeds that we received in March 2015 from the Public Offering were approximately $68.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We believe that the cash available to us after the recent public offering will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 24 months. However, changing circumstances may cause us to increase our spending significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. We may require additional capital for the further development and commercialization of our product candidates and may need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates or other research and development initiatives. Our license and collaboration agreements may also be terminated if we are unable to meet the payment obligations under the agreements. We could be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves.\nWe will have to hire additional executive officers and employees to operate our business.\nWe currently have only 14 full-time employees, of whom five are executive officers and 9 are engaged in research of development. The loss of the services of any of executive officers or research personnel could delay our product development programs and our research and development efforts. In order to develop our business in accordance with our business plan, we will have to hire additional qualified personnel, including in the areas of manufacturing, clinical trials management, regulatory affairs, and business development. Having received the net proceeds of the Public Offering, we now have sufficient funds to hire what we believe are the necessary employees to support our planned operations, and have commenced our search for additional key employees. However, competition for qualified employees among companies in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry is intense, and no assurance can be given that we will be able attract, hire, retain and motivate the highly skilled employees that we need. If we are unable to hire new skilled personnel, including management, our ability to properly develop our products and to implement our business plan will be adversely affected, which will result in a reduction in the value of our shares of common stock.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which can be costly, time consuming and can subject us to unanticipated delays; even if we obtain regulatory approval for some of our products, those products may still face regulatory difficulties.\nAll of our potential products, cell processing and manufacturing activities, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. The process of obtaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals, including foreign approvals, is expensive and often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition, regulatory agencies may lack experience with our technologies and products, which may lengthen the regulatory review process, increase our development costs and delay or prevent their commercialization.\nNo adoptive cell therapy using tumor infiltrating lymphocytes has been approved for marketing in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Consequently, there is no precedent for the successful commercialization of products based on our technologies. In addition, we have had only limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals, which may impede our ability to obtain timely FDA approvals, if at all. We have not yet sought FDA approval for any adoptive cell therapy product. We will not be able to commercialize any of our potential products until we obtain FDA approval, and so any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, FDA approval would harm our business.\nIf we violate regulatory requirements at any stage, whether before or after marketing approval is obtained, we may be fined, forced to remove a product from the market and experience other adverse consequences including delay, which could materially harm our financial results. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the promotion of our products. We may also be required to undertake post-marketing trials. In addition, if we or others identify side effects after any of our adoptive cell therapies are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products may be required.\nIt may take longer and cost more to complete our clinical trials than we project, or we may not be able to complete them at all.\nFor budgeting and planning purposes, we have projected the date for the commencement, continuation and completion of our various clinical trials. However, a number of factors, including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, and difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria, may cause significant delays. We may not commence or complete clinical trials involving any of our products as projected or may not conduct them successfully.\nOur goal is to initiate our own company-sponsored, Phase 2 clinical trial to establish the feasibility of our lead product, LN-144, and to assess its overall safety in patients with metastatic melanoma by mid-2015. However, we have not enrolled any patients yet, and we cannot guarantee that the trial will commence as scheduled. In addition, we currently also plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in 2016 in second line metastatic melanoma (those refractory to existing treatments) patients. However, because we have not yet obtained the FDA\u2019s approval for our proposed Phase 3 trial, the timing and scope of that Phase 3 trial are still uncertain (including uncertainties as to whether it will be a pivotal trial, how many patients we will have to treat, and what kind of patients those will be). Depending on the FDA\u2019s requirements, the Phase 3 trial could differ substantially from our plans and could cost more, and take longer than we anticipate.\nWe expect to rely on medical institutions, academic institutions or clinical research organizations to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our products. We will have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted them entirely on our own. If we fail to commence or complete, or experience delays in, any of our planned clinical trials, our stock price and our ability to conduct our business as currently planned could be harmed.\nWe currently anticipate that we will have to rely on our manufacturing partner, Lonza Walkersville, Inc., to manufacture our adoptive cell therapy products for clinical trials. If Lonza fails to commence or complete, or experiences delays in, manufacturing our adoptive cell therapy products, our planned clinical trials will be delayed, which will adversely affect our stock price and our ability to conduct our business as currently planned.\nWe may not be able to license new TIL technology from the NIH as we plan to do.\nAn important element of our intellectual property portfolio is to license additional rights and technologies from the NIH. Our inability to be able to license the rights and technologies that we currently have identified, or that we may in the future identify, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to complete the development of our current products or to develop additional products. We are currently in discussions with the NIH to obtain a license from the NIH for NIH patents and other TIL-related intellectual properties and for other cancer indications. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in licensing these rights or technologies from the NIH. Failure to obtain these additional rights and licenses would detrimentally affect our planned development of additional product candidates and could increase the cost, and extend the timelines associated with our development of such other products.\nWe will be unable to commercialize our products if our trials are not successful.\nOur research and development programs are at an early stage. We must demonstrate our products\u2019 safety and efficacy in humans through extensive clinical testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the testing process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our products, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 safety and efficacy results in various human clinical trials reported in scientific and medical literature may not be indicative of results we obtain in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 after reviewing test results, we or our collaborators may abandon projects that we might previously have believed to be promising;\n\u00b7 we, our collaborators or regulators, may suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participating subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; and\n\u00b7 the effects our potential products have may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved.\nClinical testing is very expensive, can take many years, and the outcome is uncertain. It can take as much as 24 months or more before we learn the results from any clinical trial using our adoptive cell therapy with TIL. The data collected from our clinical trials may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA of our TIL-based product candidates for the treatment of solid tumors. The clinical trials for our products under development may not be completed on schedule and the FDA may not ultimately approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale. If we fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any product candidate under development, we may not receive regulatory approval for those products, which would prevent us from generating revenues or achieving profitability.\nWe are required to pay substantial royalties under our license agreements with the NIH, and we must meet certain milestones to maintain our license rights.\nUnder our license agreements with the NIH for our adoptive cell therapy technologies, we are currently required to pay substantial royalties to that institution based on our revenues from sales of our products utilizing the licensed technologies, and these royalty payments could adversely affect the overall profitability for us of any products that we may seek to commercialize. In order to maintain our license rights under the NIH license agreements, we will need to meet certain specified milestones, subject to certain cure provisions, in the development of our product candidates. There is no assurance that we will be successful in meeting all of the milestones in the future on a timely basis or at all.\nBecause LN-144 represents, and our other potential product candidates will represent novel approaches to the treatment of disease, there are many uncertainties regarding the development, the market acceptance, third-party reimbursement coverage and the commercial potential of our product candidates.\nThere is no assurance that the approaches offered by LN-144 or our other potential product candidates will gain broad acceptance among doctors or patients or that governmental agencies or third-party medical insurers will be willing to provide reimbursement coverage for proposed product candidates. Moreover, we do not have verifiable internal marketing data regarding the potential size of the commercial market for our product candidates, nor have we obtained independent marketing surveys to verify the potential size of the commercial markets for our current product candidates or any future product candidates. Since our current product candidates and any future product candidates will represent new approaches to treating various conditions, it may be difficult, in any event, to accurately estimate the potential revenues from these product candidates. Accordingly, we may spend large amounts of money trying to obtain approval for product candidates that have an uncertain commercial market. The market for any products that we successfully develop will also depend on the cost of the product. We do not yet have sufficient information to reliably estimate what it will cost to commercially manufacture our current product candidates, and the actual cost to manufacture these products could materially and adversely affect the commercial viability of these products. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize products based upon our approach, we will not become profitable, which would materially and adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to develop a new, more efficient manufacturing process upon which our business plan to commercialize TIL-based products is dependent.\nPursuant to the CRADA, and in cooperation with Lonza Walkersville and potentially other manufacturers, we are trying to develop improved methods for the generating and selecting autologous TILs, and to develop methods for large-scale production of autologous TILs that are in accord with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) procedures. Developing a new, scaled-up, pharmaceutical manufacturing process that can more efficiently, and in a more automated manner measure, produce and control the physical and/or chemical attributes of our products in a cGMP facility is subject to many uncertainties and difficulties. We have never manufactured our adoptive cell therapy product candidate on any scale, commercial or otherwise, nor has Lonza Walkersville, Inc., our main manufacturing provider. As a result, we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to establish a manufacturing process that can produce our products at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable. Moreover, our third-party manufacturers will have to continually adhere to current cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. If the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass a pre-approval plant inspection, the FDA premarket approval of our products will not be granted. In complying with cGMP and foreign regulatory requirements, we and any of our third-party manufacturers will be obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record-keeping and quality control to assure that our products meet applicable specifications and other requirements. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to regulatory action. No assurance can be given that we will be able to develop such a manufacturing process, or that our partners will thereafter be able to establish and operate such a production facility.\nWe cannot prevent other companies from licensing most of the same intellectual properties that we have licensed or from otherwise duplicating our business model and operations.\nThe intellectual properties that we are using to develop TIL-based cancer therapy products were licensed to us by the NIH. However, only a few of the issued or pending patents that the NIH licensed to us are exclusive, and those are exclusive only with respect to melanoma. Otherwise, the License Agreement is non-exclusive, and any other party could obtain a license for some or all of the non-exclusive licensed intellectual properties that we currently use. No assurance can be given that the NIH has not previously licensed, or that the NIH hereafter will not license to other biotechnology companies some or all of the non-exclusive technologies available to us under the NIH License Agreement. In addition, a certain pending U.S. patent application in the NIH License Agreement is not owned solely by the NIH. No assurance can be given that NIH\u2019s co-owner of the certain pending U.S. patent application in the License Agreement has not previously licensed, or that the co-owner thereafter will not license, to other biotechnology companies some or all of the technologies available to us. Co-ownership of these intellectual properties will create issues with respect to our ability to enforce the intellectual property rights in courts, and will create issues with respect to the accountability of one entity with respect to the other.\nSince the NCI, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer & Research Institute and others already use the ACT technology in therapy for the treatment of Stage IV metastatic melanoma, their methods and data are also available to third parties, who may want to enter into our line of business and compete against us. We currently do not own any exclusive rights that could be used to prevent third parties from duplicating our business plan or from otherwise directly competing against us. While additional technologies that may be developed under our CRADA may be licensed to us on an exclusive basis, no assurance can be given that our existing exclusive rights and these new rights will be sufficient to prevent others from duplicating our business plan or from providing substantially similar products.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably.\nOur success is dependent in part on maintaining and enforcing the patents and other proprietary rights that we have licensed and may develop, and on our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. All of our intellectual property rights are licensed from another entity, and as such the preparation and prosecution of these patents and patent applications was not performed by us or under our control. Furthermore, patent law relating to the scope of claims in the biotechnology field in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent positions in our industry may not be as strong as in other more well-established fields. The patent positions of biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date.\nFor example, there have been significant changes in U.S. patent laws, as well significant changes in interpretation of U.S. patent law. These changes may materially affect our patents, as well as the ability of our Licensors or us to obtain patents. Changes in patent laws, as well as in the interpretation patent law in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims in our intellectual property that may be allowed or enforceable. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently issued opinions that greatly impact the law regarding patent eligible subject matter. As a consequence, one or all claims of issued patents in our intellectual property may be deemed invalid during litigation or in a proceeding before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and pending applications in our intellectual property may be deemed unpatentable, due to the application of this new law. Accordingly, the United States Patent and Trademark Office may not issue patents from the patent applications licensed to us. If issued, the patents may not give us an advantage over competitors with similar technology.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability and it is uncertain how much protection, if any, will be given to the patents we have licensed from the NIH or from Moffitt if either the NIH, Moffitt or we attempt to enforce the patents and/or if they are challenged in court or in other proceedings, such as oppositions, which may be brought in foreign jurisdictions to challenge the validity of a patent. A third party may challenge the validity or enforceability of a patent after its issuance by the Patent Office. It is possible that a competitor may successfully challenge our patents or that a challenge will result in limiting their coverage. Moreover, the cost of litigation to uphold the validity of patents and to prevent infringement can be substantial. If the outcome of litigation is adverse to us, third parties may be able to use our patented invention without payment to us. Moreover, it is possible that competitors may infringe our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation. To stop these activities we may need to file a lawsuit. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources, even if we were successful in stopping the violation of our patent rights. In addition, there is a risk that a court would decide that our patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of our patents were upheld, a court would refuse to stop the other party on the ground that its activities are not covered by, that is, do not infringe, our patents.\nShould third parties file patent applications, or be issued patents claiming technology also used or claimed by our licensor(s) or by us in any future patent application, we may be required to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention for those patents or patent applications that are subject to the first-to-invent law in the United States, or may be required to participate in derivation proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office for those patents or patent applications that are subject to the first-inventor-to-file law in the United States. We may be required to participate in such interference or derivation proceedings involving our issued patents and pending applications. We may be required to cease using the technology or to license rights from prevailing third parties as a result of an unfavorable outcome in an interference proceeding or derivation proceeding. A prevailing party in that case may not offer us a license on commercially acceptable terms.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and from non-profit institutions.\nCompetition in the field of cancer therapy is intense and is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological development. Research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs which may render our products obsolete even before they generate any revenue. There are products currently under development by others that could compete with the products that we are developing. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we do. Our competitors may:\n\u00b7 develop safer or more effective immunotherapeutics and other therapeutic products;\n\u00b7 reach the market more rapidly, reducing the potential sales of our products; or\n\u00b7 establish superior proprietary positions.\nPotential competitors in the market for treating metastatic melanoma will be companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche/Genentech, Merck, Amgen, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline, which already have products on the market or in development. Other companies, such as Novartis, Celgene, Kite Pharmaceuticals, Juno Therapeutics, and Adaptimmune, which are focused on genetically T cell technologies to treat cancer, may also be competitors. All of these companies, and most of our other current and potential competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and financial, scientific, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, sales, human resources, and experience than we do. Many of our competitors have several therapeutic products that have already been developed, approved and successfully commercialized, or are in the process of obtaining regulatory approval for their therapeutic products in the United States and internationally.\nUniversities and public and private research institutions in the U.S. and Europe are also potential competitors. For example, a Phase 3 study comparing TIL to standard ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma is currently being conducted in Europe by the Netherlands Cancer Institute, the Copenhagen County Herlev University Hospital, and the University of Manchester. While these universities and public and private research institutions primarily have educational objectives, they may develop proprietary technologies that lead to other FDA approved therapies or that secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products.\nWe will be dependent on third party vendors to design, build, maintain and support our manufacturing and cell processing facilities and our information technology infrastructure and systems.\nAs a result of our strategy to out-source most of our research and development and all of our manufacturing, we rely very heavily on third parties to perform for us, or assist us with a variety of important functions, including research and development, manufacturing and clinical trials management. We also license all of our technology from others and, at this time, do not own any intellectual properties or technologies. We intend to rely upon Lonza Walkersville, Inc. or other third party contract manufacturers to produce large quantities of materials needed for clinical trials and product commercialization. Third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing, quantity or quality. If we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of needed materials on acceptable terms, or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers, our clinical testing may be delayed, thereby delaying the submission of products for regulatory approval or the market introduction and subsequent sales of our products. Any such delay may lower our revenues and potential profitability.\nWe intend to rely heavily on third party vendors to design, build, maintain and support our information technology infrastructure and systems, and supply us with data center and bandwidth services. Any inability to design or delay in implementing such information technology infrastructure and systems that are compliant with 21 CFR \u00a711, the FDA\u2019s guidelines on electronic records, and other regulations, or a disruption in network access or other services provided by these third party vendors, could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties our third-party vendors face may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which we cannot predict. We will exercise little control over these third party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to any problems associated with the services they provide. We will need to license technology, software, and databases from third parties to facilitate certain aspects of the development of our information technology infrastructure and systems. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third party technologies and information services could negatively impact our business and could expose us to liabilities to third parties.\nIf any third party collaborator breaches or terminates its agreement with us, or fails to conduct its activities in a timely manner, the commercialization of our products under development could be slowed down or blocked completely. It is possible that our collaborators will change their strategic focus, pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products, either on their own or in collaboration with others, as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by our collaborative programs. The effectiveness of our collaborators in marketing our products will also affect our revenues and earnings.\nWe intend to continue to enter into additional third party collaborative agreements in the future. However, we may not be able to successfully negotiate any additional collaborative arrangements. If established, these relationships may not be scientifically or commercially successful.\nThe use of our technologies could potentially conflict with the rights of others.\nOur potential competitors or others may have or acquire patent rights that they could enforce against us. If they do so, then we may be required to alter our products, pay licensing fees or cease activities. If our products conflict with patent rights of others, third parties could bring legal actions against us or our collaborators, licensees, suppliers or customers, claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products. If these legal actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products. We may not prevail in any legal action and a required license under the patent may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nThe cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be better able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation because they have substantially greater resources. If there is litigation against us, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nShould third parties file patent applications, or be issued patents claiming technology also used or claimed by us, we may be required to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention. We may be required to participate in interference proceedings involving our issued patents and pending applications. We may be required to cease using the technology or to license rights from prevailing third parties as a result of an unfavorable outcome in an interference proceeding. A prevailing party in that case may not offer us a license on commercially acceptable terms.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks, which are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products. We do not have clinical trial insurance coverage, but we intend to obtain such liability coverage in the future. However, such insurance coverage may not be available to us at an acceptable cost, if at all. We may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in decreased demand for a product, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers and loss of revenues. Thus, whether or not we are insured, a liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material.\nWe have received a subpoena in the SEC investigation now known as \u201cIn the Matter of Certain Stock Promotions,\u201d the consequences of which are unknown.\nAs disclosed in Item 3. Litigation, below, on April 23, 2014 we received a subpoena from the SEC that stated that the staff of the SEC is conducting an investigation now known as \u201cIn the Matter of Certain Stock Promotions,\u201d and that the subpoena was issued as part of the foregoing investigation. The SEC\u2019s subpoena and accompanying letter did not indicate whether we are, or are not, under investigation. We have cooperated with the SEC and have completed our production of documents in response to the subpoena. To date, the SEC has not requested any further action from us. Nevertheless, the SEC may in the future require us to produce additional documents or other materials.\nIn general, the subpoena required us to give the SEC certain documents regarding, and communications between anyone at this company and certain listed persons and entities (which include investor-relations firms and persons associated with the investor-relations firms), and articles regarding this company posted on certain equity research or other financial websites. Although the SEC has not publicly disclosed the goals and targets of its investigation, we believe that the SEC is investigating improper conduct by investor relations firms relative to the payment of bloggers and other authors for promotional articles written about public companies. A number of articles have been written about us that may be available on the internet and elsewhere. Investors considering an investment in our securities should review this Annual Report and the other documents that we filed with the SEC rather than relying on internet blogs or other similar articles and publications.\nWe are unaware of the scope or timing of the SEC\u2019s investigation. As a result, we do not know how the SEC investigation is proceeding, when the investigation will be concluded, or if we will become involved to a greater extent than merely responding to the April 2014 subpoena. If we receive additional subpoenas or other requests for documents from the SEC, complying with any such future requests could distract the time and attention of our officers and directors or divert our resources away from ongoing research and development programs. Furthermore, it is possible that we currently are, or may hereafter become a target of the SEC\u2019s investigation. Any such investigation could result in significant legal expenses, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business, damage to our business and reputation, and could subject us to a wide range of remedies, including an SEC enforcement action.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur stock may be traded in low volumes, so you may be unable to sell your shares at or near the quoted bid prices if you need to sell your shares.\nAs a small company, the shares of our common stock may trade infrequently and in low volumes, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small early stage company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community who can generate or influence sales volume. As a consequence, there may be periods when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common shares will develop or be sustained. Due to these conditions, we can give you no assurance that you will be able to sell your shares at or near bid prices if you need money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares. As a result, investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nOur existing directors and executive officers hold a substantial amount of our common stock and may be able to prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our officers and directors beneficially owned over 27% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, if they act together, may be able to direct, or materially affect the outcome of matters presented to our stockholders, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions such as:\n\u00b7 our merger with or into another company;\n\u00b7 a sale of substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7 amendments to our articles of incorporation.\nThe decisions of these stockholders may conflict with our interests or those of our other stockholders.\nThe market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including:\n\u00b7 announcements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed such estimates;\n\u00b7 conditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other industries;\n\u00b7 general economic, political and market conditions and other factors; and\n\u00b7 the occurrence of any of the risks described in this Annual Report.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings or other equity issuances.\nWe will have to raise additional capital in the future. To raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nAs of March 12, 2015, we had over 44 million shares of our common stock outstanding. However, we have registered 13,931,426 additional shares of our common stock that could be issued under outstanding common stock purchase warrants and under outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock. If a significant number of the registered shares underlying the warrants or shares of convertible preferred stock are issued and sold on the market, the prevailing trading price could be adversely affected. In addition, we may currently expect to file a registration statement to register the future public resale of up to 9,602,743 shares of our common stock held by Ayer Capital Management LP and Bristol Investment Fund Ltd., two of our larger shareholders. In connection with the Public Offering, Ayer Capital Management LP and Bristol Investment Fund Ltd. agreed not to sell any of their shares until May 3, 2015. The sudden release of any of these additional freely trading shares onto the market, or the perception that such shares will or could come onto the market, could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our stock. In addition to the shares that are, or may be registered for re-sale, an additional 3,819,801 shares of restricted stock are currently eligible for public resale under Rule 144. The sale of these Rule 144 shares may also adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, we could become subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities and/or stockholder litigation, which could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to various regulatory requirements, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires our management to assess and report on our internal controls over financial reporting. As a small company with few employees, we have not had sufficient personnel to properly conduct all of internal control procedures and activities that require segregation of powers and responsibilities. As a result, as of December 31, 2014, we did not maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting systems. While we are attempting to remedy this material weakness, we may not be able to fully comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and future material weaknesses in our internal controls may arise. Material weaknesses in our internal controls could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, have an adverse effect on our stock price, and subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities or stockholder litigation.\nOur board could issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting existing stockholders and impairing their voting rights.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock (of which only 17,000 have been designated as the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock) with designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Our board is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our common stockholders. The issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. For example, it would be possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to effect a change in control of our company.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and therefore investors should not buy our stock if they wish to receive cash dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 15222, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "IOVA"}
