{"cik": "1633142", "company": "Press Ganey Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risk factors set forth in this Item 1A should be read in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nBecause our clients are concentrated in the healthcare industry, our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected by changes in regulations, a business downturn or consolidation in the healthcare industry.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from clients in the healthcare industry. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations are influenced by conditions affecting this industry, including changing political, economic, competitive and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operation of healthcare providers and payors. Third-party payors, including government healthcare programs and large private purchasers of healthcare services, are continuing to implement cost- containment measures and placing increasing cost pressure on providers. Healthcare providers may react to these cost pressures and other uncertainties by curtailing or deferring purchases, including purchases of our products and solutions. Moreover, there has been consolidation of companies and providers in the healthcare industry, a trend which we believe will continue to grow. Consolidation in this industry, including the potential acquisition of certain of our clients, could adversely affect aggregate client budgets for our products and solutions or could result in the termination of a client\u2019s relationship with us. When companies consolidate, overlapping services previously purchased separately are usually purchased only once by the combined company, leading to a loss of revenue by the service provider. Other services that were previously purchased by one of the companies may be curtailed or may be cancelled completely by the consolidated company. The impact of these developments on the healthcare industry is difficult to predict and could have an adverse effect on our revenue and a corresponding effect on our operating and net income.\nIn addition, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. The Affordable Care Act makes extensive changes to the current system of healthcare insurance and benefits that includes changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment policies and other healthcare delivery reforms aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, and independent payment advisory boards, among other provisions. While we believe our business has been impacted positively by certain of these changes, these provisions could negatively impact our clients and cause them to curtail or defer spending, which could result in a decreased demand for our products and solutions.\nOther legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by the U.S. Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, due to subsequent legislation, and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional U.S. Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including many of our clients.\nThere can be no assurances that healthcare reform will not adversely impact either our operating results or the manner in which we operate our business. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services. Any further reductions in spending by the federal or state governments could result in additional economic pressure on our clients and lead to reduced demand for our products and solutions or create additional pricing pressure.\nIf our clients do not continue to purchase our products and solutions, or we are unable to attract new clients, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue by selling our products and solutions to healthcare providers. Our operating results will depend, in part, on our ability to acquire new clients, to deliver a successful client experience and to maintain and grow our client relationships over time. If we are unsuccessful in marketing and selling our products and solutions or unable to deliver a positive client experience, our clients could terminate or fail to renew their agreements with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain clients, and to generate revenue from our products and solutions, depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe value proposition that we provide to our clients;\n\u00b7\nthe strength of the healthcare industry;\n\u00b7\nthe competition for our clients\u2019 spend; and\n\u00b7\nthe strength of our brand.\nSales and marketing activities represent a significant portion of our total operating expenses and account for a significant portion of the costs that we incur in acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we seek to expand our client base. If we are unable to increase the total number of our clients or unable to allocate a significant part of our resources to sales and marketing activities, our revenue may not grow and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur clients may not purchase our products and solutions or our clients may reduce their purchasing volumes if we do not demonstrate the value proposition for their investment, and we may not be able to replace existing clients with new clients. In addition, our clients may not renew their contracts with us on the same terms, or at all, because of dissatisfaction with our service. If our clients do not renew their contracts, or if we are unable to attract new clients, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of several of our large clients or a significant reduction in business from such clients would adversely affect our operating results.\nOur average annual revenue retention rate from 2013 to 2015 was approximately 95%, however we may not be able to maintain our existing client base and our historical revenue retention rate in the future. As the healthcare industry continues to undergo consolidation, some of our existing clients may merge with one another or be acquired by other organizations. We cannot assure you that any such future consolidation will not cause us to lose our existing clients or result in reduced demand for our services. In the future, we may also become more dependent on one client or a group of clients and a loss of several of our large clients or a significant reduction in business from such clients, regardless of the reason, may have a negative effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will maintain our existing client base, maintain or increase the level of revenue or profits generated by our existing clients, or be able to attract new clients.\nWe may not maintain our current rate of revenue growth.\nWe believe that our continued revenue growth will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nretain our existing clients;\n\u00b7\nattract new clients;\n\u00b7\ndemonstrate to current and potential clients that our products and solutions provide a meaningful value proposition for their business;\n\u00b7\nprovide our clients with superior user experiences;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully invest in growth opportunities;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to develop and diversify our product offerings and solutions for our clients;\n\u00b7\nreact to changes in the healthcare industry, technology and challenges from our existing and future competitors.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to do any of the foregoing, and any failure to be successful in these matters could materially and adversely affect our revenue growth. You should not consider our past revenue growth, which was driven in part by our recent strategic acquisitions and capital investments, to be indicative of our future performance. If our growth rates were to decline significantly or become negative, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to effectively execute our growth strategy which could have an adverse effect on our business and competitive position in the industry.\nOur business strategy includes increasing our market share and presence through sales to new and existing clients by enhancing engagement of our products and solutions, introducing new products and solutions and maintaining strong relationships with our existing clients. Some of the risks that we may encounter in executing our growth strategy include:\n\u00b7\nexpenses, delays and difficulties of identifying and developing new products or solutions and integrating such new products or solutions into our existing suite of solutions;\n\u00b7\ninability to generate sufficient revenue from new products and solutions to offset investment costs;\n\u00b7\ninability to effectively identify, manage and exploit existing market opportunities;\n\u00b7\ninability to retain and grow our client base and increase our clients\u2019 utilization of, and spending on, our products and solutions;\n\u00b7\ninability to recruit, train and retain skilled and experienced personnel who can demonstrate our value proposition to our clients;\n\u00b7\nincreased competition from new and existing competitors;\n\u00b7\nlengthy sales cycles, or clients delaying purchasing decisions due to economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nreduced spending within the healthcare industry; and\n\u00b7\nfailure of our market to grow at the expected rate or reach a certain size.\nIf any of these risks are realized, our business, and our competitive position in the industry, could suffer.\nWe have recently experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant growth, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. We expect that our growth strategy will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, and we expect that our sales and marketing costs will continue to increase in the near term. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to scale our systems and infrastructure accordingly and may determine that we need to open additional offices and make other capital investments, which will require significant expenditures and put further pressure on our management resources. If we fail to maintain the necessary level of discipline and efficiency, or if we fail to allocate limited resources effectively within our organization as it grows, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe may not be able to develop new products and solutions, or enhancements to our existing products and solutions, or be able to achieve widespread acceptance of new products or solutions.\nOur identification of new products, solutions and features that may be useful to our clients may not result in timely or commercially successful development of such products, solutions and features. In addition, the success of certain new products and solutions may be dependent on continued growth in our client base and we are not able to accurately predict the volume or speed with which existing and new clients will adopt such new products and solutions. Because the healthcare industry continues to change and evolve, we may be unable to accurately predict and develop new products, solutions and features to address the needs of our existing and potential clients. Our failure to release new products, solutions and/or enhancements that demonstrate to such clients that we are able to provide a meaningful value proposition for their business could result in loss of revenue, reduce our ability to meet our contractual obligations and be detrimental to our business and reputation.\nWhen we develop new products and solutions, we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market, promote and sell the new offering. Therefore, these new products and solutions must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market. If our new products, solutions or features are not accepted or are not utilized by our existing or potential clients, we may not be able to recover the cost associated with the development of such products, solutions or features, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating performance. Continued growth of our client base is dependent on our ability to provide relevant products and solutions in a timely and effective manner. The success of our business will depend on our ability to continue providing our products and solutions as well as enhancing our product offerings and solutions to effectively address the needs of healthcare providers across the continuum of care.\nTechnological developments could render our products and solutions obsolete or uncompetitive.\nThe technologies supporting the industries we serve and our platforms for delivering our solutions to our clients are susceptible to rapid changes and in order to be competitive we must consistently develop cost effective technologies for secure and reliable data collection and analysis. We may not be able to develop new technologies, update our existing technologies or adapt to the changing technological landscape as necessary for our business, or we may not do so as quickly or cost effectively as our competition.\nWe may be unable to effectively identify, complete or integrate the operations of future acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements or other growth investments.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have completed nine acquisitions over the last six years and we actively review possible acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements or growth investments that complement or enhance our business. There can be no assurance that our growth strategy or investment plans will be successful or will produce a sufficient or any return on our investments. Further, we may not be able to identify, complete or integrate the operations of future acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements or other growth investments. In addition, if we finance acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements or other growth initiatives by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions and investments, our business prospects may be seriously\nharmed. Some of the risks that we may encounter in implementing our acquisition, joint venture, collaborative arrangement or growth investment strategies include:\n\u00b7\nexpenses, delays or difficulties in identifying and integrating acquired companies or joint venture operations, collaborative arrangements or other growth investments into our company;\n\u00b7\nexpenses associated with entry into markets or care settings in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u00b7\ninability to retain personnel after future acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other initiatives and/or day-to-day operations to effectively execute our growth strategy; and\n\u00b7\ninability to generate sufficient revenue, profit and cash flow from acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative arrangements or other growth investments to offset our investment costs.\nAny of these risks could harm our business, financial position and operating results. In addition, for legal, technical or business reasons, we may not be able to successfully assimilate and integrate the business, technologies, solutions, personnel or operations of any company we acquire as quickly or fully as we would like. The integration of any acquired company may require, among other things, coordination of administrative, sales and marketing, accounting and finance functions, harmonization of legal and privacy policies and expansion of information and management systems on account of our new operations. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our growth effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we are successful in expanding our client base and growing our business, our existing operations may not be as scalable as we anticipate, and we may need to expend significant resources to enhance our information technology infrastructure, financial and accounting systems and controls, and also hire a significant number of qualified client support personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, and management personnel in order to provide services to existing and new clients. As a result, our operating expenses may increase more than expected, which could adversely affect business, financial condition and results or operations. In addition, identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them requires significant time and expense and our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to expand and train qualified personnel do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues. If our existing operations are not as scalable as we anticipate or if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, the quality of our products and solutions and our reputation may suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe operate in an increasingly competitive market, which could adversely affect our revenue and market share.\nOur future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services in the same or related care settings, some of which may have financial, marketing, technical and other advantages. We also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with one another, it could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and reduce our market share. In addition, the anticipated growth in healthcare spending, the shift to value-based payment models, the rise of consumerism and changes in government regulation may draw increasing attention to healthcare data and analytics, and new competitors, such as consultants, technology companies and start-ups may enter the market, and we may face increasing competition from these sources.\nThe ability of our clients or other competitors to replicate our products and solutions could adversely affect the terms and conditions we are able to negotiate in our contracts. We are competing with other companies to be the first to deliver timely, scientific and prospective analytics that integrate operational, safety, financial and clinical data, and any\ncompany that introduces new products in any of these areas will be at a distinct competitive advantage. In addition, some of our products and solutions allow healthcare providers to outsource business processes that have been or could be performed internally. Therefore, we must ensure that our products and solutions are more efficient and economical than our client\u2019s internal operations.\nIf for any reason we experience increased competition in our market, it could result in greater pricing pressure, an increase in our marketing expenditures or market share losses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.\nIf we fail to promote and maintain awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner, our business might suffer.\nPromoting and maintaining awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to continuing the widespread acceptance of Press Ganey as a thought leader in the industry and is an important element in attracting and retaining clients and qualified employees. The importance of brand recognition is likely to increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful products and solutions at competitive prices. Our efforts to build and maintain our brand nationally have involved and will continue to involve significant expense. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in promoting and maintaining our brand. In addition, third parties\u2019 use of trademarks or branding similar to ours could materially harm our business or result in litigation and other costs. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, which could adversely affect our business and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nWe may not be able to maintain our certification to conduct CMS mandated surveys, and this could adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our revenues from survey product offerings is attributable to providing survey services to assist clients in their compliance with regulations promulgated by CMS. As the largest CAHPS data submitter in the United States, we are currently designated by CMS as a certified vendor to offer HCAHPS Surveys, HH CAHPS Surveys, ICH CAHPS Surveys, Hospice CAHPS Surveys, OAS CAHPS Surveys, ACO CAHPS Surveys and PQRS CAHPS Surveys, including related data collection and submission services. If we are unable to maintain these certifications, or secure certifications for future CMS mandated surveys, we would not be able to administer these surveys on behalf of our clients. The failure to maintain our status as a certified vendor would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our senior management, and we may be materially harmed if we lose any member of our senior management.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our senior management team. The loss of service of any member of our senior management could materially harm our business. The employment agreements we have entered into with certain members of our senior management, including our chief executive officer, Patrick T. Ryan, are terminable at will and, therefore, we may not be able to retain their services as expected. Additionally, we do not maintain any \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance policies on the lives of our executives or any of our employees. This lack of insurance means that we may not have adequate compensation for the loss of the services of these individuals. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate newly hired executive officers into our management team and our ability to develop an effective working relationship among senior management. The loss of key management personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified management personnel could have a material, adverse effect our financial and operating performance. A decision by any of these individuals to leave our company, compete with us or reduce their involvement in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business will suffer if we fail to attract, retain and motivate highly-skilled employees.\nOur ability to successfully execute our business plan depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-skilled employees. As we expand our business, we will need to hire additional personnel to support our information technology, product development and sales and marketing operations. We may not be able to attract or retain highly-skilled employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel within our industry. If we are not able to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede our development objectives and our ability to implement our business strategy. Failure to attract new personnel as needed and retain and motivate our current personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment regulation may subject us to liability or require us to change the way we do business.\nThe laws and regulations that govern our business change rapidly. Evolving areas of law that are relevant to our business include privacy and security laws, encryption laws, content regulation, information security accountability regulation, consumer protection laws and regulations that may govern the manner in which we contact patients of our clients, sales and use tax laws and regulations and attempts to regulate activities on the Internet. In addition to being directly subject to certain requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, implementing regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or \u201cHHS,\u201d including what are referred to as the \u201cPrivacy Rule\u201d and the \u201cSecurity Rule\u201d (collectively, \u201cHIPAA\u201d), we are required through contracts with our clients to protect the privacy and security of certain personnel and health related information. The rapidly evolving and uncertain regulatory environment could require us to change how we do business or incur additional costs. Changes in these laws may limit our data access, use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of products or solutions. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, subject us to contractual penalties, including termination of our client agreements, damage our reputation and have a detrimental impact on our business. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could impact our ability to provide the same level of service and solutions to our clients, force us to modify our product offerings and solutions or increase our costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with current or future laws or regulations governing the collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of personally identifiable information, including patient health information, our business could suffer.\nThe privacy and security of personally identifiable information, also known as personal data, collected, stored, maintained, received or transmitted electronically is a major issue in our industry. While we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies and industry best practices, such laws, regulations and related legal standards for privacy and security continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards may result in threatened or actual proceedings, actions and public statements against us by government entities, private parties, consumer advocacy groups or others, or could cause us to lose clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecently, there has been an increase in public awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions and the activities of various government agencies and lawsuits filed in response to these breaches. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personally identifiable information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, could damage our reputation and harm our business. In addition, we may incur significant costs in monitoring and complying with the multitude of evolving laws and regulations relating to privacy and security, the scope of which is changing and subject to differing interpretations. We cannot provide assurances with regard to how governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy and security will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations.\nPatients enter personal data about themselves or their family members when completing our surveys, which may reveal health-related information or other personal information. Numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information, including:\n\u00b7\nstate privacy and confidentiality laws (including state laws requiring the disclosure of breaches);\n\u00b7\nMedicaid and Medicare laws;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA; and\n\u00b7\nCMS standards for electronic transmission of health data.\nHIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information, including what is known as protected health information, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers, or \u201ccovered entities,\u201d and their \u201cbusiness associates,\u201d which are persons or entities that perform certain services for, or on behalf of, a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. We are subject to HIPAA as a business associate of covered entities. In addition to imposing privacy and security requirements, HIPAA also creates obligations for us to report certain unauthorized use or disclosures of unsecured protected health information, known as a \u201cbreach,\u201d to our covered entity clients. The 2013 final HITECH rule, known as the Omnibus Final Rule, promulgated by HHS, modified the breach reporting standard in a manner that made more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. Violations of HIPAA may result in criminal and civil penalties, including fines, and could damage our reputation and harm our business. HITECH increased civil penalty amounts for violations of HIPAA, resulting in resolution amounts trending upward in recent years and possible maximum civil money penalties of $50,000 per violation of the Privacy and Security Rule. A violation can be measured by the number of individuals affected or the number of days per calendar year a covered entity or business associate is not in compliance, with each individual affected by a violation or each day not in compliance counting as a single violation. The penalty for identical violations during a calendar year may not exceed $1.5 million, but because each violation of each section of the Privacy or Security Rule is considered unique under the law, total penalties have in the past exceeded and in the future could exceed many multiples of $1.5 million. HITECH also significantly strengthened enforcement by requiring HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and authorizing state Attorneys General to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule that threaten the privacy of state residents.\nAmong other things, HITECH makes certain portions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule directly applicable to \u201cbusiness associates.\u201d Under HIPAA and our contractual agreements with our clients, we are considered a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d to our clients and thus are directly subject to HIPAA. To provide our covered entity clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA requires us to enter into business associate agreements with our clients. Those agreements must, among other things, require us to:\n\u00b7\nlimit how we will use and disclose the protected health information;\n\u00b7\nimplement reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect information from misuse;\n\u00b7\nenter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information;\n\u00b7\nreport security incidents, breaches and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and\n\u00b7\nassist the client in question with certain of its duties under the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule.\nIf we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us, our solutions may be perceived as not secure, we may incur significant liabilities and clients may curtail their use of or stop using our\nsolutions. In addition, if we fail to comply with the terms of our business associate agreements with our clients, we are liable not only contractually, but also directly under HIPAA. We cannot assure you that we will comply with all of the provisions of HIPAA that are applicable to our business, or that we will be able to address all of the risks that HIPAA creates for our clients. In addition, we are unable to predict how these standards might change or be enforced in the future or how those changes, or other changes in applicable laws and regulations, could affect our business and our clients\u2019 businesses.\nIn addition, a state\u2019s Attorney General can bring civil or criminal actions against a person subject to HIPAA on behalf of residents adversely affected by violations of HIPAA. A state\u2019s Attorney General can either seek to enjoin further violations or obtain monetary damages on behalf of the residents harmed. HHS is also currently performing audits of covered entities and business associates to ensure that policies required under HIPAA are in place. Additionally, several state civil lawsuits have found companies liable for negligence, recklessness, or other civil torts where the court has found that the company failed to comply with HIPAA. If we fail to comply with any or all of our obligations under HIPAA, we may face civil or criminal liability. Finally, individuals harmed by violations will be able to recover a percentage of monetary penalties or a monetary settlement based upon methods established by HHS. In addition, future laws or changes to current laws may necessitate costly adaptations to our operating systems and the conduct of our business generally. As part of our operations, we have access to, collect, process, transfer or maintain information covered under HIPAA. Our security measures may not be successful in protecting such data, which could expose us to liability under HIPAA. Such liability could result in fines or other sanctions and/or negative publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and business.\nData security and integrity are critically important to our business, and actual or attempted breaches of security, unauthorized disclosure of information, denial of service attacks or the perception that personal and/or other sensitive or confidential information in our possession is not secure, could result in a material loss of business, substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation.\nWe receive, collect, process, use and store a large amount of information from our survey respondents and clients and our own employees, including personally identifiable, protected health and other sensitive and confidential information. This data is often accessed by us and our clients through transmissions over public and private networks, including the Internet. The secure transmission of such information over the Internet and other mechanisms is essential to maintain confidence in our IT systems. We have implemented security measures, technical controls and contractual precautions designed to identify, detect and prevent unauthorized access, alteration, use or disclosure of our and our clients\u2019 and employees\u2019 data. However, there is no guarantee that these measures can provide absolute security. Beyond external criminal activity, systems that access or control access to our services and databases may be compromised as a result of human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable service or sabotage systems change frequently, may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world and generally are not recognized until launched against us, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nIf someone is able to circumvent or breach our security systems, they could steal any information located therein or cause interruptions to our operations. Security breaches or attempts thereof could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of monetary loss and/or litigation, fines and sanctions. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our clients and others who interact with our data. While we maintain insurance that covers certain security and privacy breaches, we may not carry appropriate insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for all potential liability.\nWe are subject to diverse laws and regulations mandating that affected individuals are notified if their information is accessed or acquired by unauthorized persons. Complying with these numerous and complex regulations in the event of a security breach would be expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny, fines and civil liability. In addition, any security breach or attempt thereof could result in liability for stolen assets or information, additional costs associated with repairing any system damage, incentives offered to clients or other business partners to maintain business relationships after a breach, and implementation of measures to\nprevent future breaches, including organizational changes, deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies, employee training and engagement of third-party experts and consultants.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our third-party service providers with access to our or our clients and/or employees\u2019 personally identifiable and other sensitive or confidential information will maintain appropriate policies and practices regarding data privacy and security in compliance with all applicable laws or that they will not experience data security breaches or attempts thereof, which could have a corresponding effect on our business. For example, we outsource certain aspects of the storage and transmission of survey data and client information to third parties. While we attempt to address the associated risks by requiring all such third-party providers with data access to sign agreements, including business associate agreements, if necessary, obligating them to take security measures to protect such data, we cannot assure you that these contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party storage and transmission of such information.\nWe face several risks relating to our ability to collect and use the data on which our business relies.\nOur ability to provide timely and accurate patient experience measurements and improvement solutions to our clients depends on our ability to collect large quantities of high-quality data through surveys. We believe that we currently have the rights necessary to collect and use the data that we incorporate into our products and solutions. In the future, data providers could seek to withdraw their data from us, legislation could be passed restricting the use of this data or we could be otherwise restricted in collecting and using the data that are incorporated into our products and solutions. In addition, if receptivity to our survey methods by respondents declines, or, for some other reason, their willingness to complete and return surveys declines, or if we cannot rely on the integrity of the data we receive, our revenue could be adversely affected with a corresponding effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions, errors or failure in connection with our or third-party information technology and communication systems and other software and hardware products used in connection with our business.\nOur ability to provide timely and accurate patient experience measurements and improvement solutions to our clients depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology and communication systems and other software and hardware used in connection with our business and those of our external service providers (whose products and services are not within our control, making it more difficult for us to correct any defects). Despite any precautions we may take, our systems, software and hardware and those of our external service providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our or their control, such as fire, natural disasters, systems failures, power outages, cyber-attacks, terrorism, energy loss, telecommunications failure, security breaches and attempts thereof and computer viruses. An operational error, delay, failure or outage in our information technology and communication systems, software and hardware or those of our external service providers could result in loss of clients, damage to client relationships, reduced revenue and profits, refunds of client charges and damage to our reputation, and may result in additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment and remedy data loss or corruption resulting from the interruption. Our preventative measures and backup systems and procedures may not prevent an interruption of services and our disaster recovery planning may not be adequate or account for all contingencies. Additionally, our insurance may not adequately compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur. The occurrence of any one of the above events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nWe may be liable to our clients and may lose clients if we are unable to collect and maintain client data or if we lose client data.\nWe collect and manage a large amount of data for our clients and other third parties. Increasingly, we are relying on technology to help us organize, sort and analyze this data. Any material hardware failures or errors in our programs or systems could result in data loss or data corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or incorrect. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be interrupted or limited by a number of factors, including network failures, software errors or problems with third-party suppliers. In addition, computer viruses may\nharm our systems, causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses from our systems to our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 systems could expose us to litigation and related liabilities and costs. If we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store, supply, utilize, and report information, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose existing clients and experience difficulties in attracting new clients.\nProtection of our intellectual property may be difficult and costly, and our inability to protect our intellectual property could reduce the value of our products and solutions.\nWe strive to protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, by relying on United States and worldwide federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions with our employees, contractors, clients, vendors and other third parties. However, effective intellectual property protection is expensive to obtain, develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration or prosecution requirements and expenses and the costs of defending our rights. We may not be able to successfully secure the intellectual property registrations that we apply for worldwide. Similarly, our existing intellectual property rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be opposed, invalidated, canceled or narrowed by a third party. In the future, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the patents, intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties, which could be time consuming and costly and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be harmed if unauthorized parties infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property, proprietary systems, content, platform, services or other information. Additionally, our existing confidentiality and/or invention assignment agreements with employees, contractors and others who participate in development activities could be breached, or we may not enter into sufficient and adequate agreements with such individuals in the first instance, in either case potentially resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. Individuals not subject to invention assignment agreements may make adverse ownership claims to our current and future intellectual property. Our trade secrets and other intellectual property could also be independently developed by competitors without liability to us. Additionally, our competitors may develop similar intellectual property, duplicate our products and/or solutions or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold. We may not have adequate remedies for such breaches, uses or disclosures, or protections against such competitor developments, all of which may adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and effective intellectual property protection and mechanisms for the enforcement of same may not be available in those jurisdictions. We may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property in these countries, and the inability to defend the same could impair our brand or adversely affect the growth of our business internationally.\nWe may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe cannot assure you that we are not infringing or violating, and have not infringed or violated, any third-party intellectual property rights, or that we will not be accused of doing so in the future. Intellectual property infringement claims could be made against us, especially as the number of our competitors grows. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive, time-consuming, cause product release delays and divert our attention from operating our company and result in a temporary or permanent inability to use the intellectual property subject to such claim. In addition, if we and/or our affiliates and clients become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and develop comparable non-infringing intellectual property, to obtain a license or to cease providing the products or solutions that contain the infringing intellectual property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing intellectual property or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur overall business, financial condition or operating results may be materially and adversely impacted by an economic downturn.\nOur business could be significantly affected by general economic conditions. The U.S. and global economies have recovered from a significant prolonged downturn but prospects for sustained economic recovery remain uncertain. Certain economic metrics have not recovered to pre-2008 levels when the U.S. economy was significantly weakened by a financial crisis. Additionally, in October 2013, the U.S. federal government shutdown caused uncertainty in the federal government\u2019s ability to meet its debt payments. A future U.S. government shutdown may occur and any resulting failure of the United States to meet its debt obligations, or the perceived risk of such a failure, could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world. To the extent that economic conditions remain uncertain, our business, financial condition and operating results could be significantly and adversely affected. For example, clients may delay or decrease spending with us or may not pay us.\nWe may experience errors in our software products that administer and report on hospital performance and inaccuracies in the solutions that we deliver to our clients. Any such errors or inaccuracies could result in action taken against us that could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business and expose us to liability.\nCertain survey data collected and reported by us is used by CMS to determine, in part, the amount of reimbursement paid to hospitals, and any errors in data collection, survey sampling, or statistical reporting could result in reduced reimbursement to our hospital clients if we are unable to correct these errors, and this could, in turn, result in litigation against us. For example, hospitals subject to the Medicare IPPS annual payment update provisions must collect and submit HCAHPS data in order to receive their full IPPS annual payment. IPPS hospitals that fail to publicly report required quality measures, which include the HCAHPS data, may have their annual payment reduced by 2.0%. In addition, CMS publicly publishes the reported survey data and any errors could result in incorrect scoring of our hospital client, which may damage the hospital\u2019s reputation and lead to litigation against us. We may be required to indemnify against such claims, and defending against any such claims could be costly, time consuming and could negatively affect our business.\nIn addition, many of the solutions that we deliver to our clients are analytically and technologically complex. Errors or inaccuracies in these solutions could materially adversely impact the ability of our clients to improve the patient experience and their operational and financial performance. In the event of errors or inaccuracies, our clients may seek compensation from us or may seek to terminate their agreements with us, withhold payments due to us, seek refunds from us of part or all of the fees charged under our agreements or initiate litigation or other dispute resolution procedures.\nFailure to offer high-quality technical support services may materially and adversely affect our relationships with our clients and harm our financial results.\nOur clients depend on our support services to resolve any technical issues relating to our solutions. In addition, our sales are highly dependent on the quality of our products and solutions, our business reputation and strong recommendations from our existing clients. Failure to maintain high-quality and highly responsive technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality and highly responsive support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our offerings to existing and prospective clients and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe offer technical support services with our products and solutions and may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in client demand for support services. It is difficult to predict client demand for technical support services and if client demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our clients and their employees. Additionally, increased client demand for these services, without corresponding increases in revenue, could increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our clients who operate as not-for-profit entities lose their tax-exempt status, those clients would suffer significant adverse tax consequences which, in turn, could adversely affect their ability to purchase products or solutions from us.\nState tax authorities have challenged the tax-exempt status of hospitals and other healthcare facilities claiming such status on the basis that they are operating as charitable and/or religious organizations. The outcome of these cases has been mixed with some facilities retaining their tax-exempt status and others being denied the ability to continue operating as not-for- profit, tax-exempt entities under state law. In addition, many states have removed sales tax exemptions previously available to not-for-profit entities, and both the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Congress are investigating the practices of not-for-profit hospitals. Those facilities denied tax exemptions could be subject to the imposition of tax penalties and assessments which could have a material adverse impact on their cash flow, financial strength, and, in some cases, continuing viability. If the tax-exempt status of any of our clients is revoked or compromised by new legislation or interpretation of existing legislation, that client\u2019s financial health could be adversely affected, which could negatively affect our sales to those clients.\nNear-term declines in revenues from new or renewed contracts with existing clients may not be reflected immediately in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nMaintaining our high revenue retention rate depends on us renewing contracts with our clients, while the amount of recurring revenues from new or renewed contracts with existing clients depends on their expected spending on our products and solutions compared to their spending during previous periods. A decline in new or renewed contracts and revenues from such contracts in any one quarter may not be fully reflected in our revenue retention rate for that period or our revenue for that period. Such declines, however, could negatively affect our revenue in future periods and the effect of significant downturns in sales of, and market demand for, our products and solutions, and potential changes in our rate of renewals or renewal terms, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our sales model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new clients must be recognized ratably over the applicable term of the contracts, which are typically 12 months. Accordingly, the effect of changes in the industry that impact our business or changes we experience in our new sales may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations.\nWe have significant goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet that may be subject to impairment losses that would materially reduce our reported assets and earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our balance sheet included goodwill of $410.8 million and identifiable intangible assets of $362.8 million, which represented 43.9% and 38.8% of our total assets as of such date, respectively. We are required to annually test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment. Additionally, impairment of such assets must be tested whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred, and we cannot predict accurately the timing of any impairment of assets. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the implied fair value of the asset in the period the determination is made. There are inherent uncertainties in the estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing differences between the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets and their implied fair value. Economic, legal, regulatory, competitive, reputational, contractual, and other factors could result in future declines in the operating results of our business or market value declines that do not support the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. For example, a significant decline in the demand for one of our product offerings could impact the fair value of the related intangible asset, which in turn could result in an impairment. Any impairment in the value of our goodwill and/or intangible assets would result in a reduction in our reported assets and earnings for the period in which an impairment is recognized, and any such reduction could be material.\nIf we are required to collect and pay back taxes on our product offerings and solutions, or if any such taxes are imposed, we may incur unplanned expenses and experience a decrease in our future sales.\nWe may become subject to sales and use taxes and related interest and penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, the imposition of any such taxes on our product offerings and solutions will effectively increase the cost of such offerings and solutions to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the states in which such taxes are imposed.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nThe agreements governing our 2015 Credit Agreement impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our company and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities, and we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure indebtedness under our 2015 Credit Agreement.\nOur 2015 Credit Agreement (as defined herein) imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability, among other things, to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness;\n\u00b7\npay certain dividends or make certain distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nprepay certain junior indebtedness;\n\u00b7\ncreate liens;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments, including certain acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nplace restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to Press Ganey;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with equity holders or other affiliates;\n\u00b7\nsell assets;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nalter the business we conduct; and\n\u00b7\nmake certain amendments to our organizational documents.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in our 2015 Credit Agreement require us to maintain a financial ratio at specified levels. See Note 8 - Revolving Credit Facility and Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our ability to comply with that financial ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to comply with that covenant.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or other financing to compete effectively or take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the total outstanding amount under our Term Loan (as defined herein) was $182.7 million, no borrowings were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) and we had $74.9 million of availability under our Revolving Credit Facility (after giving effect to a $0.1 million letter of credit outstanding thereunder). We expect borrowings under our 2015 Credit Agreement to fluctuate based on our working capital needs and the financing of acquisitions. Obligations under our 2015 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 assets.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments under our 2015 Credit Agreement or other indebtedness, we will be in default and the lenders under our 2015 Credit Agreement and the lenders or holders of other indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to lend money, lenders under our 2015 Credit Agreement and other secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their claims and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. All of these events could result in the loss of your investment in our common stock.\nServicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives.\nWe and our subsidiaries are able to incur substantial debt.\nWe are and will be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of our 2015 Credit Agreement restrict our ability to incur additional debt, they do not prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables and similar obligations, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our 2015 Credit Agreement. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe are classified as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and, as a result, we qualify for, and intend to continue to rely on, certain exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nVestar controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Under the rules of the NYSE, a company of which more than 50% of the outstanding voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d As a controlled company, we are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE that would require:\n\u00b7\na majority of the board of directors to be \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the rules of the NYSE;\n\u00b7\na nominating and corporate governance committee comprised entirely of independent directors; and\n\u00b7\na compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn accordance with those exemptions, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee are not composed entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you may not have the same\nprotections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the stock exchange corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nOur majority stockholder has the ability to control significant corporate activities and our majority stockholder\u2019s interests may not coincide with yours.\nVestar owns approximately 57.5% of our common stock as of December 31, 2015. So long as Vestar continues to hold a majority of our outstanding shares, Vestar will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and, through our Board of Directors, the ability to control decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies. Matters over which Vestar will, directly or indirectly, exercise control include:\n\u00b7\nthe election of our Board of Directors and the appointment and removal of our officers;\n\u00b7\nmergers and other business combination transactions, including proposed transactions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium price for their shares;\n\u00b7\nother material acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets;\n\u00b7\nthe incurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of equity securities;\n\u00b7\nthe repurchase of stock and payment of dividends; and\n\u00b7\nthe issuance of shares to management under our equity incentive plans.\nAs a result of Vestar\u2019s control, we may take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of your investment in our common stock to decline. In addition, Vestar is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or potential clients. Vestar or any of its portfolio companies may acquire or seek to acquire assets that we seek to acquire and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue.\nEven if Vestar\u2019s ownership of our shares falls below a majority, Vestar may continue to be able to influence or effectively control our decisions. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Vestar and its affiliates do not have any obligation to present to us, and Vestar may separately pursue, corporate opportunities of which they become aware, even if those opportunities are ones that we would have pursued if granted the opportunity.\nCertain of our directors are under no obligation to present us with business opportunities, which may prevent us from pursuing potentially profitable transactions.\nCertain of our directors are affiliated with Vestar. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, no such person is liable to us for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person, acting in good faith, pursues or acquires any business opportunity presented to Vestar or any of its officers, directors, managers, principals, members, partners, affiliates and employees, directs any such business opportunity to another person or fails to present any such business opportunity, or information regarding any such business opportunity, to us unless any such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer. This may impact our ability to pursue certain transactions on a timely basis or at all and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results or variations in the financial results of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u00b7\ndevelopment of new technologies that may address our markets and may make our technology less attractive;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us, our partners or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nfailure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of securities analysts or the investment community or that we provide to the public;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws and regulations that affect the healthcare industry;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity securities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe and our stockholders, including Vestar, may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings and we may also issue additional shares of common stock to finance future acquisitions. We have 350,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and there were 52,803,214 shares of common stock outstanding as of February 26, 2016.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including sales pursuant to Vestar\u2019s registration rights, sales by members of management and shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure, reporting and governance requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u00b7\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d);\n\u00b7\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and\n\u00b7\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments not previously approved.\nAs a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than the information provided by other public reporting companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be reduced or more volatile.\nWe have incurred increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur (particularly if we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company) significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors.\nWe continue to evaluate these rules and regulations, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in the future or the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. Our compliance with this obligation will require that we incur substantial costs and expend significant management efforts. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer. In addition, we will be required to have our independent registered accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K following the date on which we are no longer an emerging growth company. There is no guarantee that our efforts will result in management\u2019s ability to conclude, or, if applicable, our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s ability to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nIf we are not able to conclude, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is not able to attest, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. This, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable. Provisions in our debt agreements may also require an acquirer to refinance our outstanding indebtedness if a change of control occurs, which could discourage or increase the costs of a takeover.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. In particular, these provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders, if Vestar ceases to own more than 50% of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving for staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new Board of Directors at an annual meeting;\n\u00b7\nprovide that, if Vestar ceases to own more than 50% of our common stock, directors may only be removed from office for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholders, other than Vestar for so long as it beneficially owns at least 50% of our common stock, from calling special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nrequire the approval of holders of at least 75% of the outstanding shares of our voting common stock to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and for stockholders to amend our amended and restated bylaws, in each case if Vestar ceases to own more than 50% of our common stock.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nUnder our 2015 Credit Agreement, a takeover of our company would likely constitute a \u201cchange of control\u201d and be deemed to be an event of default under such facilities, which would therefore require a third-party acquirer to refinance any outstanding indebtedness under the 2015 Credit Agreement in connection with such takeover. This change of control provision, and similar provisions in future agreements, are likely to increase the costs of any takeover and may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our company by a third party.\nLimitations on director and officer liability and indemnification of our company\u2019s officers and directors by us may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against an officer or director.\nLimitations on director and officer liability and indemnification of our directors and officers by us may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against an officer or director. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, with certain exceptions as permitted by Delaware law, that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for the breach of any fiduciary duty as a director or officer, except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law, or unlawful payments of dividends. These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director or officer for breach of a fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on our behalf against a director or officer.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that certain persons bringing an unsuccessful action against us or our officers or directors may be obligated to reimburse us for any costs we have incurred in connection with such unsuccessful action.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in the event that any current or former stockholder, any current or former director, or any person acting on behalf of such stockholder or director (including any third party that receives substantial assistance from any such person or entity if such person or entity has a direct financial interest in the claim or proceeding of such third party), which we collectively refer to as claiming parties, (x) initiates, asserts or joins, offers substantial assistance to, or has a direct financial interest in (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (3) any action against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, each of the foregoing, a claim, or joins any such claim as a named party, and (y) does not thereby obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy or relief sought in the claim, then such claiming party may be obligated to reimburse us and our officers and directors for all fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees of experts) actually and reasonably incurred by us or our officers and directors in defending such claim.\nThis fee-shifting provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is not limited to specific types of actions, but is potentially applicable to all actions to the fullest extent permitted by law. Fee-shifting provisions are relatively new and untested. The case law and potential legislative action on fee-shifting provisions are evolving and there exists considerable uncertainty regarding the validity of, and potential judicial and legislative responses to, such provisions. For example, it is unclear whether our ability to invoke the fee-shifting provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in connection with claims under the federal securities laws would be pre-empted by federal law. Similarly, it is unclear how courts might apply the standard that a claiming party must obtain a judgment that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought. The application of the fee-shifting provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in connection with such claims, if any, will depend in part on future developments of the law, and the Delaware Corporation Law Council has recently recommended that the DGCL be amended to expressly prohibit companies from including fee-shifting provisions in their certificate of incorporation or bylaws for claims brought against officers and directors for violation of their state law duties. We cannot assure you that we will or will not invoke the fee-shifting provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in any particular dispute. In addition, given the unsettled state of the law related to fee-shifting provisions, such as ours, we may incur significant additional costs associated with resolving disputes with respect to such provision, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a stockholder that brings any such claim, suit, action or proceeding is unable to obtain the judgment sought, the attorneys\u2019 fees and other litigation expenses that might be shifted to a claiming party are potentially significant. This fee-shifting provision, therefore, may dissuade or discourage current or former stockholders from initiating lawsuits or claims against us or our directors and officers. In addition, it may impact the fees, contingent or otherwise, required by potential plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys to represent our stockholders or otherwise discourage plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys from representing our stockholders at all. As a result, this provision may limit the ability of stockholders to affect the management and direction of our company, particularly through litigation or the threat of litigation.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, including those under our 2015 Credit Agreement, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.", "PERMNO": 15357, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "PGND"}
