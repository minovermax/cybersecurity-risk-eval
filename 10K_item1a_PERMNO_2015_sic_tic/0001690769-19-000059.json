Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase any of our securities.\nEach of the following risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition (which we individually and/or collectively refer to as having \u201can adverse effect on us.\u201d It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. Investors should not consider this list as an exhaustive statement of all risks and uncertainties. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of both the risks described below and factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Please read the section above entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for further discussion of these matters.\nGoing Concern Risk\nOur ability to continue as a going concern contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, including the effective implementation and success of our plans to mitigate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that we would continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our liquidity and ability to comply with debt covenants under the Alta Mesa RBL and the KFM Credit Facility have been negatively impacted by increased borrowings, the recent decrease in forecasted production levels and increased operating costs in 2018 in our Upstream business, in addition to the pressures created by lower commodity prices in late 2018 and early 2019. Additionally, we failed to timely provide our lenders under the KFM Credit Facility with quarterly financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, and we failed to provide our lenders notice in connection with KFM\u2019s acquisition of the produced water assets from Alta Mesa, including the delivery of certain recorded instruments of transfer. In April 2019, we entered into an amendment and limited waiver (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the KFM Credit Facility to waive the defaults and events of default arising or resulting from those failures. The Amendment adds provisions which limit the maximum amount of cash KFM can hold to $15.0 million. The Amendment also generally provides that any amendment to a material contract with an affiliate during a six-month period that causes a reduction to projected revenue by more than 15% constitutes an event of default. We also subsequently provided the lenders the required quarterly financial statements and recorded instruments of transfer in connection with the Amendment.\nBased on our current operating and commodity price forecast and our current capital structure, and in the absence of the consummation of one or more of the deleveraging transactions discussed below, we do not anticipate being able to maintain compliance with the consolidated total leverage ratio covenant in the Alta Mesa RBL as early as the measurement date of September 30, 2019. In August 2019, the lenders exercised their ability to make an optional redetermination of the borrowing base under the Alta Mesa RBL ahead of the regular redetermination scheduled in October 2019, and via this redetermination, our borrowing base was reset to $200.0 million effective August 13, 2019. As our combined borrowings and letters of credit outstanding exceed the new borrowing base by $162.4 million, we have five months to make ratable payments of $32.5 million each month to cause utilization to be less than or equal to the borrowing base. If we are unable to make this repayment, we will be in default under the Alta Mesa RBL. The uncertainty related to our continued compliance with the terms of the Alta Mesa RBL and the potential for lenders under the Alta Mesa RBL to further reduce the borrowing base raise substantial doubt regarding Alta Mesa\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Should Alta Mesa be required to seek protection under laws governing bankruptcy before July 2020, we believe there is a risk that it or the courts could attempt to reject or alter agreements between KFM and Alta Mesa that would cause KFM\u2019s consolidated revenues to be negatively impacted by more than 15%, which would constitute an event of default under the KFM Credit Facility, as amended, giving our lenders the ability to accelerate repayment of all outstanding amounts. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern, however we have reclassified all of Alta Mesa\u2019s debt as current liabilities.\nIn March 2019, our Board authorized the retention of financial advisors to assist in evaluating the available financial alternatives, including without limitation:\n\u2022\namending or waiving the covenants or other provisions of our debt;\n\u2022\nraising new capital in private or public markets; and\n\u2022\ntaking other actions to address our balance sheet either in court or through an out of court agreement with creditors.\nWe are also considering operational matters such as reducing our forecasted capital plan. Any action or combination of such actions may be unsuccessful in attaining compliance with the covenants under the Alta Mesa RBL and the KFM Credit Facility.\nIf an agreement is reached with our creditors and we pursue a restructuring, it may be necessary for us, or our subsidiaries, to file a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order to implement the agreement through the confirmation and consummation of a plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court in the bankruptcy proceedings. We also may conclude that it is necessary to initiate Chapter 11 proceedings to implement a restructuring of our obligations even if we are unable to reach an agreement with our creditors and other relevant parties regarding the terms of such a restructuring. If a plan of reorganization is implemented in a bankruptcy proceeding, it is possible that holders of claims and interests with respect to, or rights to acquire, our equity securities would be entitled to little or no recovery, and those claims and interests may be canceled for little or no consideration. If that were to occur, we anticipate that all or substantially all of the value of all investments in our equity securities would be lost and that our equity holders would lose all or substantially all of their investment. It is also possible that our stakeholders, including our secured and unsecured creditors, will receive substantially less than the amount of their claims.\nRisks Related to our Upstream Business\nOil, gas and NGL prices are highly volatile and a sustained decrease in prices can significantly and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the carrying value of our assets.\nHistorically, the markets for oil, gas and NGLs have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, causing prices to fluctuate widely. Factors influencing the prices of oil, gas and NGLs are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil, gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nvolatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting and marketing oil, gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and gas inventories;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe level of U.S. exports of oil, LNG or NGLs;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of OPEC and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels;\n\u2022\nthe worldwide military and political environment, civil and political unrest worldwide, including in Africa and Middle East, uncertainty or instability resulting from the escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities, or acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe effect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative and competing fuels;\n\u2022\nthe value of the dollar relative to the currencies of other countries;\n\u2022\nthe level of foreign imports of oil, gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nstockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe proximity to, and capacity of, gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions worldwide.\nThe long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of oil, gas and NGLs are uncertain. Historical declines in commodity prices have adversely affected our business by:\n\u2022\nreducing the amount of oil, gas and NGLs that we can produce economically;\n\u2022\nreducing our liquidity, revenue, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022\ncausing us to reduce our capital expenditures and delay or postpone some of our capital projects;\n\u2022\ncausing reductions to the Alta Mesa RBL borrowing base, which negatively impacts our borrowing ability;\n\u2022\ncausing contraction of available trade credit;\n\u2022\npressuring our ability to meet financial covenants under our debt agreements;\n\u2022\ntriggering impairments of our long-lived assets;\n\u2022\nreducing the value of our future net cash flows from our oil and gas properties;\n\u2022\nincreasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short- and long-term debt; and\n\u2022\nadversely affecting the ability of our partners to fund their working interest capital requirements.\nIn April 2019, we removed all of our PUD reserves effective as of December 31, 2018, due to our assessment of our potential inability to fund the associated development costs. Lower oil, gas and NGL prices and any corresponding reduction in our capital expenditure budget and drilling program could cause us to further reduce our estimates of production, which could reduce the value of our oil and gas properties.\nOur operations, including development and acquisitions, will require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our production and reserves.\nOur industry is capital intensive. We have made and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition of oil and gas reserves. Due to the price environment in late 2018 and early 2019, we have substantially decreased our planned capital expenditures for 2019 compared to 2018. Prior to the August 2019 redetermination of the Alta Mesa RBL, we had anticipated upstream capital expenditures for 2019 to range between $160 million to $180 million, principally for the drilling and completion of wells, expenditures for facilities and acquisition of leasehold, but we are evaluating whether this level of capital is appropriate following that redetermination. Our upstream capital expenditures for 2018 were substantially higher. Given our reduced capital plan for 2019, we are currently estimating a decline in production during the latter half of 2019. This decline in production, as well as other factors, such as lower oil, gas and NGL prices or declines in reserves may lead to reductions in our revenue and operating cash flow and may limit our ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at desired levels, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe funded our 2018 upstream capital program primarily through equity capital raised from the Business Combination, borrowings under the Alta Mesa RBL and operating cash flow. We intend to finance our 2019 and future capital expenditures predominantly with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Alta Mesa RBL, which we drew upon in April 2019 to substantially exhaust remaining capacity.\nIf necessary, and if permitted under the agreements governing our indebtedness, we may also access capital through proceeds from potential asset dispositions and the future issuance of debt and/or equity securities. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to several variables, including:\n\u2022\nthe estimated quantities and value of our proved oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe amount of oil and gas we produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which we sell our production; and\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nOn April 1, 2019, in connection with a semi-annual borrowing base redetermination, our borrowing base under the Alta Mesa RBL was reduced from $400 million to $370 million, substantially all of which is currently utilized. In August 2019, the lenders exercised their option to conduct an optional redetermination, pursuant to which they established a revised borrowing base of $200.0 million, which will require us to make monthly installments of $32.5 million for five months beginning in September 2019. As a consequence of reduced operating cash flow and a lowered borrowing base, we have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to conduct our operations at desired levels. Additionally, if we are in default under the Alta Mesa RBL, the lenders could cease making amounts available, accelerate payment of amounts outstanding or seek other remedies any of which would further limit our access to the capital necessary to fund our capital expenditures. The Alta Mesa RBL may restrict our ability to obtain new debt financing. If additional capital is required, we may not be able to obtain debt and/or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash generated by operations or liquidity available under the Alta Mesa RBL is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our capital expenditures, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, forfeiture of leasehold interests and the sale of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis, each of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business strategy involves the use of technology, which involves risks and uncertainties in its application.\nOur operations involve the use of the latest horizontal drilling, completion and production technologies in an effort to provide for more efficient or inexpensive recovery of hydrocarbons. Although our development plan for 2019 relies upon less innovation than in prior years, our use of emerging technologies may not prove successful and could result in unexpected cost increases or decreases to production or the expected recoverability of reserves and in extreme cases, the abandonment of a well. While horizontal development has become more common in our industry, we may still face difficulties in drilling horizontal wells such as:\n\u2022\nlanding our wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u2022\nstaying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022\nrunning our production casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u2022\nrunning tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nThe difficulties that we face while completing our wells include the following:\n\u2022\ndesigning and executing the optimum fracture stimulation program for a specific target zone;\n\u2022\nrunning tools through the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u2022\ncleaning out the wellbore after completion of the fracture stimulation.\nCertain of the techniques may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to offset wells being shut-in and the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. Producing wells can be impacted by nearby completion operations which typically require nearby producing wells to de-water before production can resume. We have received, and are likely to continue to receive, claims alleging damage from our fracture and stimulation procedures on adjacent wellbores completed in the same geological interval and in other \u201cassociated\u201d geological formations located above or below the target formation. These claims are inherently uncertain, and outcomes cannot be predicted.\nFurthermore, the application of technology in one productive formation may not be successful in other prospective formations with little or no horizontal drilling history. If our use of the emerging technologies does not prove successful, our resulting production may be less than anticipated or we may experience cost overruns, timing delays or abandonment of a well. As a result, the return on our investment will be adversely affected and we could incur material write-downs of our assets, both of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur oil and gas properties are located in a limited geographic area, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having geographically concentrated operations.\nOur oil and gas properties are geographically concentrated in a portion of the STACK which causes our success and profitability to be disproportionately exposed to regional factors relative to our competitors that have more geographically dispersed operations. These factors include, among others: (i) the prices of crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in the region and other regional supply and demand factors, including midstream capacity constraints; (ii) the access to and\navailability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies and labor; and (iii) the availability of and access to processing and refining facilities. In addition, we may have a heightened risk to the adverse effects of severe weather events such as floods, ice storms and tornadoes, which can disrupt operations and intensify competition and risk of unavailability of the items described above. The geographic concentration of our operations also increases our exposure to changes in local laws and regulations, wildlife protection stipulations and other unexpected regional events such as natural disasters, seismic events, industrial accidents or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter our ability to conduct development activities.\nOur management team has specifically identified and scheduled the prospective drilling locations on our existing acreage. Our ability to develop our identified locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil, gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of necessary field services and equipment, midstream constraints, access to and availability of water to conduct development, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these locations. In addition, unless we meet the development timing requirements on our undeveloped acreage, the leases covering such acreage may expire, causing us to lose the opportunity of future development. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations.\nOur current estimated drilling locations are based on the spacing pattern that we believe will maximize the economic returns associated with development. If our expectations about well results with such spacing pattern prove incorrect, there could be a material reduction to our estimated drilling locations and inventory life.\nIn addition, we will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations, and we may not be able to access or raise the capital required. Any drilling activities we conduct on these locations may be unsuccessful which would limit our ability to add proved reserves or result in a downward revision of our estimated recoveries, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur undeveloped properties include leases that will expire over the next several years if production is not established on units containing that acreage.\nLeases on oil and gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless renewed or, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. Although the majority of our reserves are located on leases that are held by production, the leases included in our unproved properties typically have provisions whereby a lease will expire at the end of the lease term unless certain conditions are met, such as commencement of drilling or the existence of production in paying quantities within defined time periods. A reduction to our drilling program, lower commodity prices or our inability to fund our capital program could cause some of our unproved inventory to become unrealizable, be subject to lease expiration or require us to incur renewal or extension costs. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. This could result in a reduction in our acreage and growth opportunities (or the incurrence of significant costs). Our drilling plans for undeveloped acreage are also subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil, gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.\nWe depend on development of reserves and upon consummation of acquisitions to maintain our reserve base and revenue.\nIn general, the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on each reservoir\u2019s characteristics. For example, we estimate that our base production has a decline rate of approximately 40%. Thus, absent development of reserves or acquisition of properties that have existing proved developed reserves, our revenue could decline as reserves are produced. Our future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. Our reduced drilling program for 2019 could negatively affect our ability to replace reserves and maintain our current production levels, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, to the extent our operating cash flow falls below projections and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable, our ability to conduct the capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base would be impaired.\nWe recognized material impairments to our Upstream and Midstream assets during 2018. Lower oil, gas and NGL prices or adverse changes in our own operational performance may trigger additional impairments which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may recognize further significant impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties or other long-lived assets as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices, results of our development activities, reductions to our drilling plans or other material issues related to our businesses. As a result, we may be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in accounting losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could lead to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may result in our inability to obtain future financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nGAAP requires that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties and other long-lived assets for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics, and other factors, we may be required to impair our assets further.\nOur estimated proved reserves and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves. Our estimation of proved reserves is complex and requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, and these reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions regarding production levels and operating and development costs. Although the SEC has established a rule specifying the commodity prices that are incorporated into our proved reserve estimates, the prices that we use in estimating the fair value require us to develop future oil, gas and NGL prices in line with forward market expectations. We also estimate well costs and operating expenses based on recent experience, but these estimates could prove inaccurate. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future cash flows and production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates to reflect actual drilling results and production. Any significant variance in our assumptions and actual results could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimated future net cash flows. Specifically, future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. Sustained lower prices will cause the 12-month weighted average price to decrease over time as the lower prices are reflected in the average price, which may result in reductions to the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves.\nThe standardized measure of our proved reserves will not be the same as the current fair value of our oil and gas properties.\nWe do not believe that the present value of future net revenue from our proved reserves represents the fair value of our oil and gas properties. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the closing prices on the first day of each month for the preceding 12 months without giving effect to derivatives. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for our production, including the effects of our hedging program;\n\u2022\nactual cost of development and production expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\ntransportation and processing cost and availability; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with our operations will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenue and thus our oil and gas properties\u2019 actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use in the standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor to utilize in determining the fair value of our oil and gas properties. Actual future prices and costs may also differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the NASDAQ, may strain our resources, increase our costs and divert management\u2019s attention, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company. We also incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. These rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board or as executive officers.\nCommencing December 31, 2018, we became a \"large accelerated filer\" and, accordingly, no longer qualify as an emerging growth company and are no longer able to rely on certain exemptions that were available to us as an emerging growth company. Legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses may increase in the future as we continue to incur both increased external audit fees as well as additional spending to ensure continued regulatory compliance.\nWe rely on drilling to increase our levels of production. Our production levels will be adversely affected by the planned reductions in our capital program.\nA key component to our business strategy is to increase production levels by drilling wells. Although we were successful in elevating production levels during 2018, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or grow production levels in the future. For example, our reduced drilling program for 2019 and our limited capital availability could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase production levels and we are currently estimating a decline in production for each quarter in 2019. We may be unable to accelerate our drilling program in future years to make up for lost production which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow. Acquisitions that we do complete could be on terms that prove to be uneconomic.\nWe have made and expect to make future acquisitions of businesses or properties that complement or expand our current business. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from sellers for liabilities incurred prior to our acquisition.\nThe success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, our debt agreements impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combinations transactions and our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions.\nOur business is subject to operational risks that will not be fully insured, which could adversely affect us.\nOur business activities are subject to operational risks, including:\n\u2022\ndamages or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes and adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022\npipeline or tank ruptures or spills;\n\u2022\nsurface fluid spills and water contamination;\n\u2022\nfires, blowouts, well collapses and explosions; and\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil or gas or other well fluids.\nIn addition, a portion of our gas production is processed to separate NGLs. If the processing plants that service us were to cease operations, we would need to arrange for alternative transportation and processing facilities, which may not be available. If unavailable, we might have to shut in our gas and, therefore, other production, which could reduce our operating cash flow. Further, any alternative facilities could be more expensive than the facilities we currently use.\nAny of these types of events could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental contamination, loss of wells, regulatory penalties, suspension or termination of operations and attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation.\nAs is customary in our industry, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of insurance exceeds our perceived risks. Losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on us.\nDrilling for and producing oil and gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect us.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our development, acquisition and production activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil and gas production.\nOur decisions to develop or purchase properties will depend on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. As addressed elsewhere in our Risk Factors, this variability in interpretations presents risk for us. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our contemplated capital activities, including:\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by regulatory bodies or from regulatory compliance, including regulations imposed on produced water disposal;\n\u2022\nregulation limiting the emission of GHGs;\n\u2022\nwell set-back legislation or regulation;\n\u2022\nregulation limiting hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022\nunexpected pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, qualified personnel or water for hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022\nequipment failures, accidents or other unexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nlack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;\n\u2022\nlack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nissues related to compliance with environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as leaks, spills, ruptures and unauthorized discharges of fluids and gases associated with our operations;\n\u2022\ndeclines in oil and gas prices;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing at acceptable terms; and\n\u2022\ntitle problems.\nOur derivative program could result in financial losses or could reduce our net income.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas, we regularly enter into derivatives (\u201chedges\u201d) covering a significant portion of our expected production. The Alta Mesa RBL requires us to hedge at least 50% of anticipated equivalent production of our PDP reserves for the upcoming twenty-four month period at each measurement date, but also imposes maximum hedging levels for each production stream. Details of our derivative assets are included in Item 8. If we experience a sustained material interruption in our production, we might be forced to make payments under our hedging program without the benefit of the proceeds from our sale of the underlying production, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Further, risk exists that the counterparty in any derivative transaction cannot or will not perform under the instrument and that we will not realize the benefit of the hedge, although all of the counterparties to our current portfolio are lenders under the Alta Mesa RBL. Under that agreement, if a counterparty is a lender and does not perform, then the non-performance is treated as a reduction to the borrowings outstanding. Furthermore, given our current financial condition,\nour counterparties have ceased providing the credit necessary to enter into new hedges. Therefore, we may be more exposed to future price fluctuations. We may also be unable to comply with the minimum hedging requirements under the Alta Mesa RBL.\nOur policy has been to meet the minimum required hedging levels under the Alta Mesa RBL and to opportunistically hedge an additional portion of our near-term estimated production. Other than the compliance with minimum and maximum hedging levels, our price hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined using Board and management discretion, depending on the financial and future commodity expectations at the time. The prices at which we hedge our production in the future will be dependent upon commodities prices at the time we enter into these transactions, which may be substantially higher or lower than current prices. Accordingly, our price hedging strategy may not protect us from significant declines in prices received for our future production. Conversely, our hedging strategy may limit our ability to realize cash flows from commodity price increases. It is also possible that a substantially larger percentage of our future production will not be hedged, as compared to current or historic levels, which would result in our oil and gas revenue becoming more sensitive to commodity price fluctuations.\nOur use of seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of hydrocarbons, which could adversely affect us.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques help geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators, but do not prove the amount, if any, of hydrocarbons present in those structures. The use of seismic data and other advanced technologies requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, which may result in additional costs without an uplift to a well\u2019s economics. As a result, even our successful drilling activities may not prove economic.\nWe often gather seismic data surveys over large areas including areas where we own no mineral rights. We may choose not to acquire or pursue mineral interests in areas covered by these surveys, which could result in substantial expenditures to acquire and analyze seismic data without the prospect of future benefit of production.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil or gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional properties and pursue our operational objectives is dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive market. Our competitors may be able to pay more for oil and gas properties and pursue a greater number of properties than we can. In addition, our industry has periodically experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has adversely affected the timing and cost of operating. Competition has been historically strong in hiring experienced personnel, particularly in the engineering and technical, accounting, legal and land disciplines. An inability to compete effectively with our competitors could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nOur industry has been characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies, all of which could either generate better recoveries or reduce development costs. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and gas companies may be better able to leverage technological advantages. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, it may have a material adverse effect on us.\nDeficiencies in title to our leased interests could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf an examination of the title history of a property reveals that an oil or gas lease or other developed rights has been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the mineral interest desired, our interest would substantially decline in value. In such cases, the amount paid for such oil or gas lease or leases or other developed rights would be lost. In acquiring mineral rights, we typically choose not to incur the expense of retaining title attorneys, instead we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records before we attempt to acquire a lease or other mineral interest.\nPrior to drilling a well that we operate, however, we do obtain a preliminary title review of the spacing unit to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well. If we do find defects, we must perform or fund curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title, such as obtaining affidavits of heirship or causing an estate to be administered. We may also elect to proceed with a well despite defects to the title identified in the preliminary title opinion. If we fail to obtain defensible title to our leasehold, we may be unable to develop additional reserves or benefit from the expected ownership.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water and our inability to obtain water may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWater is an essential component of unconventional oil and gas upstream development during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners and other sources for use in our operations. However, our access to such water supplies may become limited by factors such as extended drought, competition for water or governmental regulation. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of water, our ability to develop our reserves could be restricted or made less economic, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nLitigation and investigations by private plaintiffs or government officials or entities could adversely affect our performance.\nOil and gas upstream and midstream activities are complex and involve risks that could lead to legal proceedings. We currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. The subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, contract, title or royalty disputes, regulatory compliance matters, personal injury or property damage matters or disputes related to any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. In some cases, the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. For instance, we and certain of our former and current directors and officers were named as defendants in three putative securities class action claims alleging that the defendants disseminated a false and misleading proxy statement in connection with the Business Combination as well as alleged misstatements after the Business Combination. In addition, the SEC is conducting a formal investigation into the facts involved in the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and the impairment disclosed previously and in this Annual Report.\nThese and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, it is possible that such proceedings could result in liability, penalties or sanctions, judgments, consent decrees, injunctive relief or orders requiring a change in our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Accruals for such liabilities, penalties or sanctions may be insufficient, and judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material.\nOur operations are regulated and the costs to comply or a failure to comply could be costly and have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of wide-ranging environmental requirements applicable to our operations. Such environmental laws and regulations include the following federal laws (along with their state counterparts):\n\u2022\nthe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d), which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, imposes various pre-construction, monitoring and reporting requirements and is relied upon by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to GHG emissions;\n\u2022\nthe Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d), which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;\n\u2022\nthe Oil Pollution Act (\u201cOPA\u201d), which imposes liabilities for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill into waters of the United States;\n\u2022\nthe Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d), which ensures the quality of the nations\u2019 public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and control over the subsurface injection of fluids into belowground formations;\n\u2022\nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d), which imposes requirements for the generation, treatment, storage, transport disposal and cleanup of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes;\n\u2022\nthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances sent for disposal to sites where hazardous substance\nreleases have occurred or are threatening to occur, as well as imposes liability on present and certain past owners and operators of sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;\n\u2022\nthe Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees and response departments about toxic chemical uses and inventories;\n\u2022\nthe Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d), which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating limitations or restrictions or a temporary, seasonal or permanent ban on operations in affected areas; and\n\u2022\nthe National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d), which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments or environmental impact statements.\nThese U.S. laws and their implementing regulations, as well as state counterparts, generally restrict the level of pollutants emitted to ambient air, discharges to surface water, and disposals or other releases to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective actions, the incurrence of capital expenditures, delays in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our future operations in a particular area. Certain environmental laws and regulations impose strict joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or other wastes have been disposed of or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, wastes or other materials into the environment. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and more stringent laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment governing our industry, particularly changes in the Oklahoma forced pooling system, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is subject to various forms of extensive government regulation, including laws and regulations concerning the location, spacing and permitting of the wells we drill and the disposal of produced water. Changes in the legal and regulatory environment, particularly any changes to Oklahoma\u2019s forced pooling procedures could result in increased compliance costs and adversely affect us.\nIn the past we have used, and we expect to continue to use, Oklahoma\u2019s forced pooling process to increase our working interest in sections we propose to drill. In recent years, a relatively low percentage of working interest owners in our operated sections have elected to participate in our wells. Due to the continuing consolidation in the STACK by producers with greater access to capital, other working interest owners may be more likely to participate in the wells we drill. Thus, our ability to use forced pooling to increase our working interest may be more difficult to accomplish.\nThe adoption of derivatives legislation and regulations could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) establishes federal oversight and regulation of over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives and requires the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) to enact further regulations affecting derivatives, including those we use to hedge our commodity exposure. Although the CFTC and the SEC have issued final regulations in certain areas, final rules in other areas and the scope of relevant definitions and/or exemptions still remain to be finalized.\nIn one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued on December 5, 2016 a re-proposed rule imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in various commodities (including gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Under the proposed rules on position limits, certain types of hedging transactions are exempt from these limits on the size of positions that may be held, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for certain enumerated \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions or positions. A final rule has not yet been issued.\nSimilarly, on December 2, 2016, the CFTC re-issued a proposed rule regarding the capital a swap dealer or major swap participant is required to set aside with respect to its swap business, but the CFTC has not yet issued a final rule.\nThe CFTC issued a final rule on margin requirements for uncleared swap transactions on January 6, 2016, which includes an exemption from any requirement to post margin to secure uncleared swap transactions entered into by commercial end-users in order to hedge commercial risks affecting their business. In addition, the CFTC has issued a final rule authorizing an exemption from the otherwise applicable mandatory obligation to clear certain types of swap transactions through a derivatives clearing organization and to trade such swaps on a regulated exchange, which exemption applies to swap transactions entered into by commercial end-users in order to hedge commercial risks affecting their business. The mandatory clearing requirement currently applies only to certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps, but the CFTC could act to impose mandatory clearing requirements for other types of swap transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes record keeping and reporting obligations on counterparties to swap transactions and other regulatory compliance obligations.\nAll of the above regulations could increase the costs to us of entering into derivatives to hedge or mitigate our commodity price exposure. While we cannot predict when the CFTC will issue final rules applicable to position limits or capital requirements, it may require time and effort for us to comply with position limits and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities. When a final rule on capital requirements for swap dealers is issued, the Dodd-Frank Act may require our counterparties to post additional capital, which could increase the costs of future derivatives. In addition, other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could cause current counterparties to restructure their derivative activities, including the potential that they might cease engaging in the business of commodity derivatives.\nIf we voluntarily or involuntarily reduce our use of derivative contracts as a result of the new requirements, we become more exposed to commodity price fluctuations, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations.\nOur Upstream operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. Failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our properties, and receipt of drilling permits with onerous conditions could increase our compliance costs. In addition, regulations regarding conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights affect our operations by limiting the quantity of oil and gas we may produce and sell.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration, production and transportation of oil and gas, and incur costs to comply with such federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nUnder the Natural Gas Act (\u201cNGA\u201d), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) regulates the interstate transportation and sale for resale of gas, as well as the construction and operation of interstate gas pipelines. As a general matter, states regulate the intrastate transportation, local distribution and retail sale of gas under state laws and regulations.\nUnder the Interstate Commerce Act (\u201cICA\u201d), FERC also regulates the rates and practices of oil pipeline companies engaged in interstate transportation, establishes equal service conditions to provide shippers with equal access to oil pipeline transportation, and establishes reasonable rates for transporting petroleum and petroleum products by pipeline.\nThe U.S. Congress, FERC, state legislatures and regulatory commissions and courts often consider legislative and regulatory proposals and proceedings that could affect the gas and oil industry. The industry historically has been heavily regulated and we cannot predict future legislative and regulatory proposals and proceedings or what effect such proposals or proceedings may have on our operations. The possibility exists that new laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and significantly increase our compliance costs. If we are not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenue, our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders administered by the FERC or CFTC, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (\u201cEPAct\u201d), FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA, including the ability to impose penalties of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation of the NGA or FERC\u2019s regulations under the NGA. We do not currently operate any FERC-regulated assets nor are we or our subsidiaries regulated by FERC as \"natural gas companies\" under the NGA. However, as a customer of gas transportation service, we must comply with the terms and conditions of FERC-jurisdictional tariffs pursuant to which transportation service is provided and the anti-market manipulation rules enforced by FERC under the NGA. If we fail to comply with all the applicable FERC-administered statues, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties. FERC also has the power to order disgorgement of profits from transactions deemed to violate the NGA.\nUnder the Commodity Exchange Act (as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the CFTC, the CFTC has also adopted anti-market manipulation, fraud and market disruption rules relating to the prices of commodities, futures contracts, options on futures, and swaps. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by Congress, FERC, or the CFTC from time to time. Failure to comply with those statutes, regulations, rules and orders could subject us to civil penalty liability.\nClimate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and may continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. The EPA has, however, adopted regulations under the CAA that, among other things, establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already potential sources of significant pollutant emissions. Sources subject to these permitting requirements must meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards for those GHG emissions. Additionally, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG emission sources in the United States, including, among others, onshore and offshore oil and gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which include certain of our operations.\nFederal agencies also directly regulate emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and gas operations. In August 2016, the EPA issued a final NSPS rule, known as Subpart OOOOa, that requires certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards expand previously issued NSPS published by the EPA in 2012 and known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices. On September 11, 2018, however, the EPA proposed changes to the August 2016 final NSPS rule applicable to oil and gas well vapor leaks. These changes, if implemented, would ease compliance obligations by decreasing fugitive emission monitoring frequency requirements, allowing more time for repairs, and allowing compliance with certain state regulations in lieu of complying with federal regulations. Moreover, on March 2, 2017 the EPA withdrew a previously issued Information Collection Request that sought information about methane emissions from facilities and operations in the oil and gas industry.\nIn December 2015, the United States attended the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. At the Conference, an agreement was prepared that requires member countries to determine, plan, and regularly report on their contribution to the mitigation of global warming. Under the agreement, GHG emission reduction goals are established every five years beginning in 2020. The agreement does not create any binding obligations for countries to limit their GHG emissions but, rather, includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. This \u201cParis Agreement\u201d was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States planned to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process is uncertain, and the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement, if it chooses to do so, are unclear at this time.\nThe adoption and implementation of any international treaty, or federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiative that imposes a carbon tax, requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, any such new treaty, legislation, regulation or initiative could increase the cost to the consumer, and thereby reduce demand for oil and gas, which could reduce the demand for the oil and gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves.\nFinally, it should be noted that some sources estimate that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, our development and production operations could be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters in low lying areas, disruption of our production activities because of climate related damages to our facilities, less efficient or non-routine operating practices necessitated by such climate effects, or increased costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations. Nor, are we (on our own) capable of doing this in a prudent and accurate manner that would best serve our investors\u2019 interests. A number of investors have decided not to invest in hydrocarbon producers, which could have an adverse effect on our future cost of capital.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could increase our costs of doing business, impose additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice we use to develop our reserves. The process involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques to stimulate production from the wells we drill.\nOur hydraulic fracturing technique is currently generally exempt from regulation under the SDWA\u2019s Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) program and is typically regulated by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority or pursued investigations over certain aspects of the process. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d including water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. In June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and, in 2014, the EPA asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities. Also, in 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) published a final rule that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. On December 29, 2017, BLM rescinded the 2015 rule. California and certain environmental groups have sued over the BLM\u2019s rescission of the 2015 rule.\nAdditionally, in 2014, the EPA published an advanced notice of public rule making regarding Toxic Substances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d) reporting of the chemical substances and mixture used in hydraulic fracturing. From time to time, Congress has introduced, but not adopted, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process.\nIn addition, some states, including Oklahoma, have adopted, regulations that restrict or could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances and that require the disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to anomalous seismic events. In December 2016, the OCC Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Oklahoma Geological Survey released well completion seismicity guidance, which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions, including an operator\u2019s planned mitigation practices, following certain unusual seismic activity within 1.25 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations. States could elect to prohibit high-volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular, although\nOklahoma has taken steps to limit the authority of local governments to regulate oil and gas development. The issuance of any laws, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose new obligations on, or significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing, could make it more difficult or costly for us to develop our reserves or conduct our operations, either one of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from our drilling and production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe dispose of produced water gathered from our operations pursuant to permits issued to our affiliates or third-party vendors by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent permitting or operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities.\nOne such concern relates to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of produced water resulting from oil and gas activities. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, where we operate. In response to these concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states, including Oklahoma, have imposed, and other states are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water injection wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma issued new rules for injection wells in 2014 that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on injection wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, developed and implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend injection well operations. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (\u201cOCC\u201d) has implemented the National Academy of Science\u2019s \u201ctraffic light system,\u201d in determining whether new injection wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted at all. In addition, the OCC has established rules requiring operators of certain produced water injection wells in seismically-active areas, or Areas of Interest, within the Arbuckle formation of the state to, among other things, conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells\u2019 depth that, depending on the depth, could require the plugging back of such wells and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. As a result of these measures, the OCC from time to time has developed and implemented plans calling for injection wells within Areas of Interest where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal operations in an attempt to mitigate the occurrence of such incidents. In February 2017, the OCC\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation District issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and gas wastewater injected below ground into the Arbuckle formation in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state.\nAlso, ongoing lawsuits allege that injection well disposal operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules governing waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities utilizing injection wells for produced water disposal. Evaluation of seismic incidents and whether or to what extent those events are induced by the injection of produced water into disposal wells continues to evolve, as governmental authorities consider new and/or past seismic incidents in areas where produced water injection activities occur or are proposed to be performed. Court decisions or the adoption of any new laws, regulations or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of produced water generated by production and development activities, whether by plugging back the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of produced water disposed in such wells, restricting injection well locations or otherwise or by requiring us to shut down injection wells, could significantly increase our costs to manage and dispose of this produced water, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations pertaining to threatened and endangered species or protective of environmentally sensitive areas could delay or restrict our operations and cause us to incur significant costs.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions or costly mitigation measures imposed under various federal and state statutes in order to protect endangered or threatened species and their habitats, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. Federal statutes, as amended from time to time, that are protective of these species, birds and environmentally sensitive areas include the ESA, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (the \u201cMBTA\u201d), the CWA, the CERCLA and the OPA. For example, to the extent that species are listed under the ESA or similar state laws and live in areas where our oil and gas upstream activities are conducted, our ability to conduct or expand operations and construct facilities could be limited or we\ncould be forced to incur material additional costs. Moreover, our operations may be delayed, restricted or precluded in protected habitat areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d) may designate new or increased critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species, which designation could result in material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or oil and gas development. As a result of one or more settlements approved by the federal government, the FWS must make determinations on the listing of numerous specified species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specified timelines. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could indirectly cause us to incur additional costs, cause our operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas. If harm to protected species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or, at times, private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and, in some cases, may seek criminal penalties. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we conduct operations could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or time delays or limitations on our operations.\nWe could experience periods of higher costs if oil and gas prices rise or as drilling activity otherwise increases in the STACK, which could reduce our ability to develop our reserves and otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.\nHistorically, our capital and operating costs typically rise during periods of sustained increasing oil, gas and NGL prices. These cost increases result from a variety of factors beyond our control as drilling activity increases, such as increases in the cost of electricity, tubular goods, water, sand and other disposable materials used in fracture stimulation and other raw materials that we and our vendors rely upon; and the cost of services and labor, especially those required in horizontal drilling and completion. As commodity prices rise or drilling activity otherwise increases in the STACK, our costs for materials, services and labor may increase, which may negatively impact our profitability, cash flow and cause us to delay, reduce or curtail our drilling program.\nThe sale of our production is dependent upon midstream and downstream facilities over which we may have no control.\nThe marketability of our production depends upon the availability, proximity and capacity of facilities and services, including pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, trucking or terminal facilities and processing facilities. We deliver oil, gas and NGLs through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not necessarily own. The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could impact us by causing our production to be shut-in, reducing the price we receive for our production or delaying or eliminating our future development plans. Although we have some contractual control over this third-party-operated risk by virtue of the underlying contracts, such systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or operational reasons. Further, in the future, these systems and facilities may not be available to us at a price that is acceptable to us. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new systems and facilities, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur Upstream business relies primarily on KFM for gathering, transportation, processing and produced water disposal services.\nOur oil and gas production, not otherwise previously dedicated, is dedicated to KFM. Also, in November 2018, Alta Mesa sold its produced water assets to a subsidiary of KFM. In conjunction with the sale, Alta Mesa entered into a new 15-year water gathering and disposal agreement with KFM\u2019s subsidiary. As a result, our Upstream business is substantially dependent upon KFM for its oil, NGL, gas and produced water-related operations. If KFM were unable to continue to provide these services, it could result in the shut-in of our production or cause delays and additional costs to find alternate providers for those services, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe parties on whom we rely for gathering, transportation and processing services are subject to complex federal, state and other laws that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business.\nGathering, transportation and processing operations are subject to complex laws and regulations that require parties providing these services to obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certifications with various levels of government. These operations could require substantial costs in order to comply with existing laws and regulations. If laws and regulations governing such operations are enacted, revised or reinterpreted, these changes may affect the costs that we pay for such\nservices. There could be a material adverse effect on us if the gathering, transportation and processing operations that we rely upon were materially impacted by those laws and regulations.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenue.\nWe have limited control over properties that we do not operate, including a limited ability to influence normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of the underlying properties. The failure of another operator to adequately perform operations or that operator\u2019s financial difficulties could reduce our production and revenue. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others, depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s timing of development and amount of capital expenditures, expertise and financial resources.\nTurnover of our key executives and Board of Directors and difficulty of recruiting and retaining key employees could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe experienced a significant amount of executive-level turnover in late 2018. In early 2019, we introduced a new executive team including an Interim President, an Interim Chief Operating Officer and a Chief Financial Officer. Our inability to retain the new management team and our remaining key executives and employees could harm our business and operations and have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur success will depend to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of our management team and having experienced individuals serving on our Board who are also knowledgeable about our operations and our industry. We may be unable to timely replace the talents and skills of our management team or directors if one or more did not continue serving. Our business also depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain or find replacement employees, the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on us. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Acquiring and keeping personnel could prove more difficult or cost substantially more than estimated. These factors could cause us to incur greater costs or prevent us from pursuing our development and exploitation strategy as quickly as we would otherwise wish to do.\nWe operate in an area of high industry activity, which may affect our ability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets.\nOil and gas development in the STACK has been quite active in recent years. As a result, demand for qualified personnel in this area, and the cost to attract and retain such personnel, increased over the past few years and may increase again in the future. Moreover, our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. Any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to conduct our planned development activities could result in our production falling below our forecasted volumes, which could have a material adverse effect on us at our estimated production levels in the next several years.\nWe may encounter obstacles marketing our oil and gas which could adversely impact our revenue.\nThe marketability of our production will depend in part upon the availability of purchasers in our area plus gathering systems and pipelines owned by third parties. Transportation space on the gathering systems and pipelines we utilize is occasionally limited or unavailable due to repairs or improvements to facilities, but since we hold firm transportation covering our current level of gas production we do not believe a significant risk exists that other companies would hold priority over us in the near term.\nThe availability of markets is beyond our control. If market factors dramatically change, our revenue could be substantially impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not corrected, could affect the reliability of our financial statements, increase our costs and efforts to ensure accurate reporting and have other adverse consequences.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). Section 404 of SOX requires management to assess the effectiveness of our ICFR. Based on our assessment as of December 31, 2018, we concluded that our ICFR was not effective as of that date, due to identification of material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in ICFR that causes a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement could occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our material weakness relates to both the design of our controls and execution of control procedures. Item 9A contains additional information regarding our deficiencies and the proposed remediation plan.\nIf not remediated, the material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management has developed, and begun to implement, a plan to remediate the material weaknesses. We may not be able to implement the plan, or to remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner. In addition, we may require more than one year to effect a system of internal controls and an information technology environment that are sufficiently designed and properly executed to prevent material misstatements from going undetected. Furthermore, during the course of re-designing existing processes and controls, implementing additional processes and controls and testing of the operating effectiveness of such re-designed and additional processes and controls, we may identify additional control deficiencies that could give rise to other material weakness, in addition to the currently identified matters. If we are unable to remediate our material weakness, or if additional material weakness or deficiency is discovered, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or timely, which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated, which could adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to access the capital markets. Furthermore, the effort to remediate our internal controls could be expensive or could distract management from managing the business, either of which could adversely affect us.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud that could seriously harm our business may occur and not be detected.\nWe do not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the resource constraints and the benefit of controls relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, an evaluation of controls can only provide reasonable assurance that all material control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations reflect that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect error or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business and operations could be negatively impacted by shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price.\nShareholder activism, which could take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and our Board\u2019s attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations.\nOur industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and for compliance reporting. Industrial control systems such as SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) now control large scale processes that can include multiple sites and long distances, such as power generation and transmission, communications and oil and gas pipelines.\nWe depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also\ndependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct oil and gas exploration and development activities and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, also have increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. SCADA-based systems are potentially vulnerable to targeted cyber-attacks due to their critical role in operations.\nOur systems and networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of information, or cause other disruptions to our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others:\n\u2022\nunauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, royalty owner data or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources;\n\u2022\ndata corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;\n\u2022\ndata corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;\n\u2022\na cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt a development project, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;\n\u2022\na cyber-attack on a third party gathering or pipeline service provider could prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenue;\n\u2022\na cyber-attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenue;\n\u2022\na cyber-attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenue;\n\u2022\na deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u2022\nexpensive remediation efforts, distraction of management or damage to our reputation.\nOur implementation of various controls and processes, including globally incorporating a risk-based cyber security framework, to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure is costly and labor intensive. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax preferences could be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThere has been proposed legislation that would, if enacted, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws regarding provisions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such legislative changes have included the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas upstream development. If enacted into law, these proposals would eliminate certain tax preferences applicable to taxpayers engaged in our industry. These changes include:\n\u2022\nthe repeal of the percentage depletion allowance;\n\u2022\nthe elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling costs; and\n\u2022\nthe increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geophysical costs.\nIt is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or proposed by current or future administrations or how soon any such changes would become effective. In addition, Congress passed tax reform in December of 2017, and that legislation has changes including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe elimination of the deduction for U.S. production activities;\n\u2022\nthe provision for individual taxpayers to deduct 20% of their domestic qualified business income (which may provide some relief from the aforementioned item);\n\u2022\nmore stringent limitation on business interest deduction;\n\u2022\nmodification of NOL carryforward rules; and\n\u2022\nchanges to items excluded from the $1.0 million executive compensation deduction limitation.\nThe further passage of any legislation, including the proposals above, or changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt. Higher levels of indebtedness make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nOur present level of indebtedness requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay interest, which reduces funds available to finance our capital and acquisition activities and could limit our flexibility in reacting to changes in our business. The outstanding debt under both the Alta Mesa RBL and KFM Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate, and so a rise in interest rates will generate greater interest expense (provided we have not hedged against interest rate increases). The amount of our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nWe may incur substantially more debt in the future. The indenture governing our outstanding 2024 Notes contains restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness. These restrictions, however, are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, we could incur substantial additional indebtedness and remain in compliance with these restrictions. Moreover, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute \u201cindebtedness\u201d as defined under the indenture.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. If cash flow is not sufficient to service debt, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or sell additional securities on terms that we may not find attractive if it may be done at all. Further, the failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to the indebtedness could result in a default under that indebtedness, which could have a material adverse affect on us.\nOur significant indebtedness could give rise to other material adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe Alta Mesa RBL and the indenture governing the 2024 Notes have cross default provisions, which could result in the acceleration of indebtedness under both agreements if we fail to comply with the covenants and other provisions in either agreement;\n\u2022\nit may be difficult to satisfy our obligations, including debt service requirements under debt agreements, or maintain compliance with financial and other debt covenants;\n\u2022\nwe might be unable to fund operations, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other general corporate needs;\n\u2022\na significant portion of our cash flow is committed to payments on our debt, which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes, such as future capital expenditures, acquisitions and general working capital;\n\u2022\nwe are more vulnerable to price fluctuations and to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry is more limited; and\n\u2022\nour ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures may be limited.\nThe Alta Mesa RBL and the indenture governing Alta Mesa\u2019s 2024 Notes have restrictive covenants that could limit its growth, financial flexibility and its ability to engage in certain activities. Since Alta Mesa is our subsidiary, most of the effects apply to us.\nThe Alta Mesa RBL and the indenture governing Alta Mesa\u2019s 2024 Notes have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. These covenants, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nguaranty or make loans to others;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments and distributions;\n\u2022\nenter into or be party to hedge agreements;\n\u2022\namend our organizational documents;\n\u2022\nincur liens; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of our lenders.\nIn addition, the Alta Mesa RBL requires Alta Mesa to maintain financial ratios or to reduce its indebtedness if it is unable to comply with such ratios, which may limit its ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in its business or the economy in general or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. Alta Mesa may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of these limitations.\nAny significant reduction to the Alta Mesa RBL borrowing base as a result of the periodic redeterminations or other reasons may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under the Alta Mesa RBL, if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nAvailability under the Alta Mesa RBL was subject to a borrowing base of $400.0 million at December 31, 2018. The borrowing base is subject to at least semi-annual redeterminations that are based on the value of Alta Mesa\u2019s oil and gas reserves as determined by the Alta Mesa RBL lenders and other factors deemed relevant by the lenders. On April 1, 2019, the borrowing base was reduced to $370.0 million upon completion of the regularly scheduled semi-annual redetermination. Substantially all of the available borrowing base is currently utilized. In August 2019, the lenders exercised their option to conduct an optional redetermination, pursuant to which they established a revised borrowing base of $200.0 million, which will require us to make monthly installments of $32.5 million for five months beginning in September 2019. As a consequence of reduced operating cash flow and a lowered borrowing base, we have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to conduct our operations at desired levels. Additionally, if we are in default under the Alta Mesa RBL, the lenders could cease making amounts available, accelerate payment of amounts outstanding or seek other remedies any of which would further limit our access to the capital necessary to fund our capital expenditures. Declines in oil and gas prices or a decrease in reserves for any reason, including the removal of our PUDs in April 2019, could cause the Alta Mesa RBL banks to reduce the borrowing base as part of future redeterminations. Any significant future reduction in our borrowing base could have a material negative impact on our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under the Alta Mesa RBL were to exceed the borrowing base due to any such redetermination, we would be required to repay the excess. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may be in default under the Alta Mesa RBL, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, we could default under the terms of such agreements, which could ultimately result in an acceleration of repayment.\nIf we cannot comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be a default under the terms of these agreements. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants, including meeting financial ratios and tests, may be affected by events beyond our control. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to comply with these restrictions and covenants or meet such financial ratios and tests. Although certain types of circumstances (such as delays in providing timely financial information) give rise to defaults that are curable under the agreements, we may not be able to cure all defaults within the cure period, which could give rise to an event of default and potentially an acceleration of amounts due. Moreover, if we are in default on any indebtedness, we would be unable to make borrowings under the Alta Mesa RBL or the KFM Credit Facility even if there are remaining borrowings available thereunder.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under those agreements. During 2019, we may be unable to satisfy the consolidated total leverage ratio in the Alta Mesa RBL and recognize the need to obtain covenant relief or to replace the Alta Mesa RBL with debt that would allow us to meet any attendant covenant requirements. In the event of such a default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, the lenders under the Alta Mesa RBL could terminate their commitments to lend, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy protection. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, such as the indenture governing Alta Mesa\u2019s 2024 Notes, may also be accelerated and become due and payable. If any of these events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in\nfull all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not be able to amend our debt agreements or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms.\nTo service our indebtedness, we require significant liquidity and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to service and refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our generating cash. This ability hinges on general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will generate sufficient operating cash flow, that we will realize the planned operating cost improvements or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to service and repay our debt, while still funding our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative plans such as:\n\u2022\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022\nselling assets;\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying capital investments; or\n\u2022\nseeking to raise additional capital.\nAny alternative plans that we undertake may still not enable us to meet our debt obligations. We can provide no assurance that any refinancing or debt restructuring would be possible, that any assets could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of the sales and proceeds realized from those sales would be favorable or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt or to obtain alternative financing could have a material adverse effect on us and could result in us being unable to continue as a going concern.\nRestrictions in KFM\u2019s Credit Facility could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Since KFM is our subsidiary, most of the effects of these debt facilities on KFM apply equally to us.\nKFM is a party to a $300.0 million credit agreement that matures on May 30, 2023, with quarterly interest payments due on Base Rate loans. KFM\u2019s interest rates depend upon its consolidated leverage ratio and KFM can elect to borrow on a Eurodollar Loan or Base Rate Loan basis. Both the Eurodollar Loan and Base Rate Loan margins are subject to minimum rates established by third-party institutions, such as, but not limited to the Federal Reserve. The terms of this credit agreement limit KFM\u2019s ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nincur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another company; and\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets.\nThe KFM Credit Facility also contains covenants requiring it to maintain certain financial ratios. KFM\u2019s ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond its control, and KFM cannot assure that it will meet any such ratios and tests.\nThe provisions of the KFM Credit Facility may affect its ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of the credit facility could result in a default or an event of default that could enable KFM\u2019s lenders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of KFM\u2019s debt is accelerated, its assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full.\nIf High Mesa Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cHMI\u201d) default on their obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations, and could cause a default under the Alta Mesa RBL and could adversely impact the trading price for our securities.\nHigh Mesa Services LLC (\u201cHMS\u201d), a subsidiary of HMI, is the promissor under two promissory notes in the principal amount of $1.5 million and $8.5 million. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.7 million and $11.7 million, respectively, were\noutstanding under the promissory notes including the accumulated interest cost. The promissory notes became the property of the Company pursuant to the identification of acquired assets under the Business Combination. When the $1.5 million promissory note became due on February 28, 2019, HMS made no payment and therefore defaulted under its terms, and HMS has failed to cure such default. Following the default, we submitted a demand letter to preserve our rights, declaring all amounts owing under the $1.5 million note immediately due and payable. HMI disputes that it has any obligation to pay the $1.5 million promissory note and the $8.5 million promissory note to us. We are pursuing remedies in connection with securing repayment of the past due promissory note by HMS and the $8.5 million promissory note, which matures on December 31, 2019, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in securing such repayment in full, or in part, or that HMI will have the liquidity necessary to repay the notes.\nPursuant to the Business Combination, we distributed our non-STACK oil and gas assets to a subsidiary of HMI, and certain subsidiaries of HMI agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from any liabilities associated with those non-STACK oil and gas assets, regardless of when those liabilities arose. We also entered into a management services agreement (the \u201cMSA\u201d) with HMI whereby we agreed to provide management services to HMI with respect to the non-STACK oil and gas assets, which included both operational and administrative functions. At December 31, 2018, HMI owed us approximately $10.0 million, which includes amounts owed (i) under the MSA, (ii) from a duplicate revenue payment made to HMI and (iii) pursuant to payables arising prior to the Business Combination. Subsequent to year-end, we billed HMI an additional $0.9 million for incremental MSA costs incurred and have received approximately $1.0 million in payments toward all amounts outstanding. HMI has disputed certain of these amounts. We are pursuing remedies under applicable law in connection with repayment of this receivable. There is no guarantee that HMI will pay the amounts it owes. In addition, our ability to collect these amounts or future amounts that may become due pursuant to indemnification obligations may be adversely impacted by liquidity and solvency issues at HMI. As a result, we have recognized an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $9.0 million to fully provide for the un-remitted balance and may have future allowances for amounts incurred in 2019 prior to the termination of the MSA. We also may be subject to liabilities for the non-STACK assets for which we should be indemnified, including liabilities associated with litigation relating to the non-STACK assets.\nUnder the Alta Mesa RBL, Investments (as defined) are limited to $10.0 million. If the amounts due from HMI continue unpaid, they may be deemed Investments, which when aggregated with other Investments could cause Alta Mesa to be in default under the Alta Mesa RBL. Such default would require us to get a waiver or other relief from our lenders. If we are unable to get such relief, the lenders may exercise their rights under the agreement, which as described elsewhere in our Risk Factors, could include acceleration of amounts due. A failure by HMI to pay its obligations to us could also have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Alternatively, if HMI, which holds an estimated 134.0 million shares of our Class C Common Stock, sells all or a portion of those shares to fulfill its obligations under the MSA, the trading price of our shares may be negatively affected.\nAdditionally, we are co-guarantors under certain surety bonds with HMI, including bonds that cover the non-STACK oil and gas assets owned by them. The surety has requested posting of collateral. If HMI cannot post collateral or satisfy its indemnity obligations, Alta Mesa may be required to post collateral or otherwise satisfy HMI\u2019s obligations associated with HMI surety bonds in an amount of approximately $15 million.\nRisks Related to our Midstream Business\nWe must continually compete for crude oil, gas and produced water supplies, and any decrease in supplies of such commodities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn order to maintain or increase throughput levels in our gathering system and asset utilization rates at our processing plant, we must continually contract for new product supplies. We may not be able to obtain additional contracts for crude oil and gas and NGL supplies. The primary factors affecting our ability to connect new wells to our gathering facilities include our success in contracting for existing supplies that are not committed to other systems and the level of drilling activity near our gathering system. If we are unable to maintain or increase the volumes on our system by accessing new supplies to offset the natural decline in reserves, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, our future growth will depend in part upon whether we can contract for additional supplies at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in our current supplies.\nAny decrease in the volumes that we gather, process, store or transport would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes of crude oil, gas and produced water gathered, processed, stored and transported on our assets. Decreases in the volumes of crude oil, gas and produced water we gather, process, store or transport would directly and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These volumes can be influenced by factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nenvironmental or other governmental regulations, including changes in tax policy;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nincreases in storage levels of crude oil, gas and produced water;\n\u2022\nincreased use of alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for crude oil, gas and produced water;\n\u2022\ncontinued fluctuation in commodity prices, including the prices of crude oil, gas and produced water;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nsupply disruptions;\n\u2022\navailability of supply connected to our systems; and\n\u2022\navailability and adequacy of infrastructure to gather and process supply into and out of our systems.\nThe volumes of crude oil, gas and produced water gathered, processed and transported on our assets also depend on the production from the region that supplies our systems. Supply of crude oil, gas and produced water can be affected by many of the factors listed above, including commodity prices and weather. For instance, during 2018, we saw reduced drilling activity due to lower commodity prices and changes to the drilling plans of the operators with acreage dedicated to KFM, and we were unable to secure volumes from our Upstream business and third parties at levels we were projecting. Because we are substantially dependent on our Upstream business for a significant portion of our throughput, the reduced Upstream 2019 drilling program and any subsequent reductions in that program could significantly lower future volumes on the system if we are unable to find third-party customers.\nIn order to maintain or increase throughput levels on our system, we must obtain new sources of crude oil, gas and produced water. The primary factors affecting our ability to obtain non-dedicated sources of crude oil, gas, and produced water include (i) the level of successful leasing, permitting and drilling activity in our areas of operation, (ii) our ability to compete for volumes from new wells and (iii) our ability to compete successfully for volumes from sources connected to other pipelines. We anticipate that the reduced 2019 drilling program of our Upstream business may affect the production supply levels on our system. Additionally, we have no control over the level of drilling activity of third parties in our area of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our system or the rate at which production declines from a well. In addition, we have no control over producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, the availability and cost of capital, levels of reserves, availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.\nConstruction of certain midstream assets subjects us to risks of construction delays, cost over-runs, limitations on our growth and negative effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe construction of midstream assets is complex and subject to a number of factors beyond our control, including delays from third-party landowners, the permitting process, complying with laws, unavailability of materials, construction delays, labor disruptions, environmental hazards, financing, accidents, weather and other factors. Any delay in the completion of these midstream assets could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The construction of pipelines and gathering and processing and storage facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed our estimated costs. Estimating the timing and expenditures related to these development projects is very complex and subject to variables that can significantly increase expected costs. Should the actual costs of these projects exceed our estimates, our liquidity and capital position could be adversely affected. This level of development activity requires significant effort from our management and technical personnel. We may not have the ability to attract and/or retain the necessary number of personnel with the skills required to bring complicated projects to successful conclusions.\nOur construction of new assets may be more expensive than anticipated and may not result in revenue increases and may be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond our control including potential protests or legal actions by interested third parties that may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. Financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. If we undertake these projects, we may not be able to complete them on\nschedule, at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, our revenue may not increase due to the successful construction of a particular project. For instance, if we expand a pipeline or construct a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and we may not receive any material increases in revenue promptly following completion of a project or at all. Further, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future production growth in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the construction of additions to our existing gathering and processing assets will generally require us to obtain new rights-of-way and permits prior to constructing new pipelines or facilities. We may be unable to timely obtain such rights-of-way or permits to connect new product supplies to our existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights-of-way or to expand or renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, our cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for our operations which could inhibit our ability to do business.\nPerformance of our operations requires that we obtain and maintain a number of federal and state permits, licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of our compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could adversely affect our ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future, we may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processing-related activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations.\nWe typically do not obtain independent evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves; therefore, volumes we service in the future could be less than anticipated.\nWe typically do not obtain, on a regular basis, independent evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves connected to our gathering systems or that we otherwise service due to the unwillingness of producers to provide reserve information as well as the cost of such evaluations. Accordingly, other than reserve estimates with respect to our Upstream business, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves serviced by our assets or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves is less than we anticipate and we are unable to secure additional sources, then the volumes we gather and process could be lower, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur exposure to commodity price risk may change over time.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from our Midstream business pursuant to fee-based contracts under which we are paid based on the volumes that we gather, process and transport, rather than the underlying value of the commodity, in order to minimize our exposure to commodity price risk. However, we are a party to fee-based contracts that have a small portion of percent-of-proceeds contractual mix, but the portion of percent-of-proceeds does not exceed 6.0% for any one contract. In addition, we may acquire or develop additional midstream assets in a manner that increases our exposure to commodity price risk. Future exposure to the volatility of crude oil, gas and NGL prices could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Also, as with any acreage dedications, the profitability of those dedications depends on drilling activity that is often influenced by the behavior of commodity prices.\nIf third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to our gathering, processing, storage or transportation systems become partially or fully unavailable, or if the volumes we gather, process, store or transport do not meet the quality requirements of the pipelines or facilities to which we connect, our gross profit and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nOur Midstream assets connect to pipelines or facilities owned and operated by unaffiliated third parties. The continuing operation of, and our continuing access to, such third-party pipelines and other facilities is not within our control. These\npipelines, plants and other midstream facilities may become unavailable because of testing, turnarounds, line repair, maintenance, reduced operating pressure, lack of operating capacity, regulatory requirements and curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or because of damage from severe weather conditions or other operational issues. In addition, if our costs to access and transport on these third-party pipelines significantly increase, our profitability could be reduced. If any such increase in costs occurs, or if we lose access to these pipelines or other midstream facilities, or if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet their product quality requirements, our gross profit and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe midstream industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe compete with similar midstream enterprises in our area of operation. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Our competitors include large crude oil and gas companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of crude oil, gas and produced water than us. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. Excess pipeline capacity in the region served by our intrastate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact our ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to our available capacity when existing contracts expire. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain or increase current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and customers. Further, gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including electricity, coal and liquid fuels. Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of gas could lead to a reduction in demand for gas gathering, processing, storage and transportation services. All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or efficiently and effectively integrate the acquired midstream assets with our existing asset base, our future growth will be limited.\nOur ability to grow depends, in part, on our ability to make midstream acquisitions that result in an increase in cash generated from operations. If we are unable to make accretive acquisitions either because we are (1) unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them, (2) unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or at all or (3) outbid by competitors, then our future growth will be limited.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate and seek to acquire midstream assets or businesses that we believe complement our existing business and related assets. We may acquire midstream assets or businesses that we plan to use in a manner materially different from its prior owner\u2019s use. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected volumes, revenue, profitability or growth;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize any expected synergies and cost savings;\n\u2022\nthe coordination of geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems.\nThe assessment by our management of these risks is inexact and may not reveal or resolve all existing or potential problems associated with an acquisition. Realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we consummate any future acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly.\nWe may not be able to retain existing Midstream customers or acquire new customers, which would reduce our revenue and limit our future profitability.\nThe renewal or replacement of our existing contracts with our Midstream customers at rates sufficient to maintain or increase current revenue and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including competition from other midstream service providers and the price of, and demand for, crude oil, gas and NGLs in the markets we serve. The inability of\nour management to renew or replace our current contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could have a negative effect on our profitability.\nIf our Midstream assets become subject to FERC regulation or federal, state or local regulations or policies change, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that our gathering and transportation operations are exempt from regulation by FERC under the NGA. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC under the NGA. Although FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of our facilities, we believe that the gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility or services provided by us are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGPA and the rules and regulations promulgated under those statutes. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nUnlike gas gathering under the NGA, there is no exemption for the gathering of crude oil or NGLs under the ICA. Whether a crude oil or NGL shipment is in interstate commerce under the ICA depends on the fixed and persistent intent of the shipper as to the crude oil\u2019s or NGLs\u2019 final destination, absent a break in the interstate movement. We believe that the crude oil and NGL pipelines in our gathering system meet the traditional tests FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is not providing transportation service in interstate commerce subject to FERC ICA jurisdiction. However, the determination of the interstate or intrastate character of shipments on our crude oil and NGL pipelines depends on the shipper\u2019s intentions and the transportation of the crude oil or NGLs outside of our system, and may change over time. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and the character of a crude oil or NGL shipment, and determine that the shipment is in interstate commerce, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, transportation services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the ICA. Such FERC regulation could change our current revenue stream, increase operating costs, and, depending on the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the ICA, this could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such services in excess of the rate established by FERC.\nOther state and local regulations also affect our business. We are subject to some ratable take and common purchaser statutes in Oklahoma. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport gas. Federal law leaves any economic regulation of gas gathering to the states, and Oklahoma has adopted complaint-based or other limited economic regulation of gas gathering activities.\nOur operations are regulated, and we may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from compliance with these regulations.\nThe pipelines we own and operate are subject to stringent and complex regulation related to pipeline safety and integrity management. The federal authority for pipeline safety is the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\u201cPHMSA\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Transportation and is responsible for regulating the safety of design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, and emergency response of U.S. oil and gas pipeline facilities. Compliance with PHMSA standards and regulations requires us to incur significant costs. In addition, violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties.\nSeveral states have also passed legislation or promulgated rules to address pipeline safety. Compliance with pipeline integrity laws and other pipeline safety regulations issued by state agencies such as the OCC could result in substantial expenditures for testing, repairs and replacement. If our pipelines fail to meet the safety standards mandated by the OCC or the PHMSA regulations, then we may be required to repair or replace sections of such pipelines or operate the pipelines at a reduced maximum allowable operating pressure, the cost of which cannot be estimated at this time.\nDue to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that future compliance with PHMSA or state requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. Because certain of our operations are located around areas that may become more populated areas, such as the STACK play, we may incur expenses to mitigate noise, odor and light that may be emitted in our operations and expenses related to the appearance of our facilities. Municipal and other local or state regulations are imposing various obligations including, among other things, regulating the location of our facilities, imposing limitations on the noise levels of our facilities and requiring certain other improvements that increase the cost of our facilities. We are also subject to claims by neighboring landowners for nuisance related to the construction and operation of our facilities, which could subject us to damages for declines in neighboring property values due to our construction and operation of facilities.\nIn addition, the types and volumes of certain chemicals handled by our processing plants pose process safety management risks, including hazards related to the storage, handling and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. These potential risks include pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures, explosions and fires, mechanical failure and chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases at our sites or during transportation. Managing these process hazards is heavily regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s Process Safety Management standard, and compliance with this standard can require significant expenditures. Moreover, violations of this standard can result in the imposition of significant penalties and the partial or total cessation of operations.\nThe potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address potential induced seismic activity in the areas in which we operate could result in increased compliance costs and operating restrictions.\nOur produced water disposal business is subject to existing laws and regulations with legal requirements that are subject to change which could affect our ability to operate the disposal wells. In response to recent seismic events near produced water disposal wells, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have contributed to increased seismic activity, and some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma has taken numerous regulatory actions in response to concerns related to the operation of produced water disposal wells and induced seismicity, and has issued guidelines to operators in certain areas of the State curtailing injection of produced water due to seismic concerns. Some states have also restricted, suspended or shut down the use of certain disposal wells. Evaluation of seismic incidents and whether or to what extent those events are induced by the injection of produced water into disposal wells continues to evolve, as governmental authorities consider new and/or past seismic incidents in areas where produced water injection activities occur or are proposed to be performed. Court decisions or the adoption of any new laws, regulations or directives that restrict our ability to operate our disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to the foregoing risks affecting our Midstream business, many of the risks that apply to our Upstream business also apply to our Midstream business.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Capital Structure\nOur only significant asset is the ownership of the general partner interest and an approximate 47% limited partner interest in SRII Opco, and such ownership may not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations, including under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of the general partner interest and an approximate 47% limited partner interest in SRII Opco. We will depend on SRII Opco and its subsidiaries, including Alta Mesa and KFM, for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations. Subject to certain restrictions, SRII Opco generally is required to (i) make pro rata distributions to its partners, including us, in an amount at least sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and (ii) reimburse us for certain corporate and other overhead expenses. However, legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing future indebtedness of SRII Opco and its subsidiaries, including Alta Mesa and KFM, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of Alta Mesa and KFM may limit our ability to obtain cash from SRII Opco. The earnings from or other available assets of SRII Opco and its subsidiaries, including Alta Mesa and KFM, may not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations. SRII Opco is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income will be allocated to holders of its SRII Opco Common Units, including us. As a result, we generally\nwill incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of SRII Opco. Under the terms of the agreement of limited partnership of SRII Opco (the \u201cSRII Opco LPA\u201d), SRII Opco is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of its SRII Opco Common Units, including us, except to the extent such distributions would render SRII Opco insolvent or are otherwise prohibited by law or any of our current or future debt agreements. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our operations, our interests in SRII Opco and related party agreements, including payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and expenses and costs of being a public company, all of which could be significant. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d To the extent that we need funds and SRII Opco or any of its subsidiaries is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to pay our income taxes when due.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market prices of our Class A Common Stock and public warrants originally sold in our initial public offering (\u201cPublic Warrants\u201d) have been, and we expect them to continue to be, subject to significant volatility, and they have declined significantly from their prices on the closing date of the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2018, the reported closing price of our Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ was $1.00 per share and our Public Warrants was $0.07 per warrant. Such fluctuations could be in response to, among other things, the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, or other factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the market in general;\n\u2022\nnegative perceptions about us based upon the presence of material weakness in internal control;\n\u2022\noutcome of the SEC investigation;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany major change in our Board or management;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of Class A Common Stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and NASDAQ have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur securities may be delisted from NASDAQ.\nOur Class A Common Stock and Public Warrants are currently listed on NASDAQ. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of NASDAQ.\nWe received letters on April 2, 2019, April 3, 2019 and May 14, 2019 from NASDAQ notifying us that we were not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because we did not timely file this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, we failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share and we did not timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. We submitted a plan to NASDAQ on May 29, 2019 to\nregain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) to allow for continued listing. Our plan was accepted by NASDAQ and we were granted an extension until September 30, 2019, to regain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s filing requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of NASDAQ, our securities may become subject to delisting. If NASDAQ delists our Class A Common Stock or Public Warrants from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the continued listing standards, we and our security holders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022\na limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability for us to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our securities adversely, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. We have seen the number of analysts covering our stock reduce to just one. This could limit the interest in our securities and negatively affect their price. We do not have any control over the research and reports published or if they will be published at all. If any analysts who may cover us today or in the future make negative recommendation regarding our securities adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our securities could decline. The loss of the remaining analyst could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThere is no guarantee that our Public Warrants will be in the money at a time when they are exercisable, and they may expire worthless; the terms of our Public Warrants may be amended without the consent of all holders.\nThe exercise price for our Public Warrants is $11.50 per share and our common stock closed at $0.146 per share on June 28, 2019. Accordingly, the Public Warrants are significantly underwater and may not be in the money at a time when they are exercisable, and as such, the Public Warrants may expire worthless.\nIn addition, the warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us provides that the terms of the Public Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding Public Warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the Public Warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding Public Warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the Public Warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding Public Warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the Public Warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a Public Warrant.\nWe may redeem the Public Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to holders, thereby making their Public Warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem the outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that (i) the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within the 30 trading-day period ending on the third business day before we send the notice of such redemption and (ii) on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time the Public Warrants are redeemed, there is an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of our Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available or we have elected to require the exercise of the Public Warrants on a cashless basis. Redemption of the outstanding Public Warrants could force holders of Public Warrants:\n\u2022\nto exercise their Public Warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so;\n\u2022\nto sell their Public Warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their Public Warrants; or\n\u2022\nto accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding Public Warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of their Public Warrants.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Charter and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur Charter and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nup to two of our nine directors may be appointed by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and up to three of our directors may be appointed by holders of the Series B Preferred Stock without any vote of the holders of Class A Common Stock;\n\u2022\na board that is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors to serve on our Board or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that an annual meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer, or the Board, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of us or changes in our Board and management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding voting common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding voting common stock. Any provision of our Charter or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their securities and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our securities.\nIf a significant portion of our total outstanding shares were sold into the market in the near future, the market price of our Class A Common Stock could drop significantly.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of Class A Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. The holders of our founder shares, which include Silver Run Sponsor II, LLC (our \u201cSponsor\u201d) and independent directors, and Fund VI Holdings own approximately 36% of our Class A Common Stock that is currently outstanding. In addition, the Contributors have a redemption or exchange right with respect to all of their respective SRII Opco Common Units. If the Contributors and their permitted transferees redeem or exchange all of their SRII Opco Common Units for shares of Class A Common Stock, they will collectively own approximately 53% of our Class A Common Stock following such redemption or exchange. The sale by these holders of a large number of shares, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nA significant percentage of our outstanding voting common stock is held by High Mesa Holdings and our Sponsor.\nHigh Mesa Holdings, together with its affiliates, and our Sponsor, together with its affiliates, beneficially own approximately 35% and 22%, respectively, of our voting common stock. As long as these entities own or control a significant percentage of outstanding voting power, they will each have the ability to strongly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our Board, any amendment of Charter or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets.\nThe interests of High Mesa Holdings and our Sponsor and their respective affiliates may not align with the interests of our other stockholders. Our Sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our Sponsor and its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our Charter provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of our officers and directors and their respective affiliates and each such party shall not have any obligation to offer us those opportunities unless presented to one of our directors or officers in his or her capacity as a director or officer.\nWe will be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\nIn connection with the completion of the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with the AM Contributor and the Riverstone Contributor (the \u201cInitial Limited Partners\u201d) and SRII Opco. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be required to make cash payments to the Initial Limited Partners and their permitted transferees (together, the \u201cTRA Holders\u201d) equal to 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the Business Combination as a result of (i) certain tax basis increases resulting from the exchange of SRII Opco Common Units for Class A Common Stock (or, under certain circumstances, cash) pursuant to the redemption right or our right to effect a direct exchange of SRII Opco Common Units under the SRII Opco LPA, other than such tax basis increases allocable to assets held by KFM or otherwise used in our Midstream business, and (ii) interest paid or deemed to be paid by us as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings. The amount of the cash payments that we may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be significant and is dependent upon significant future events and assumptions, including the timing of the exchanges of SRII Opco Common Units, the price of our Class A Common Stock at the time of each exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable transactions and the amount of the exchanging TRA Holder\u2019s tax basis in its SRII Opco Common Units at the time of the relevant exchange. The amount of such cash payments is also based on assumptions as to the amount and timing of taxable income we generate in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rate then applicable and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that constitute interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis. Moreover, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, which tax reporting positions are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. We will be dependent on distributions from SRII Opco to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and we cannot guarantee that such distributions will be made in sufficient amounts or at the times needed to enable us to make our required payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, or at all. Any payments made by us to the TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. Nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and therefore, may accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are also not conditioned upon the TRA Holders maintaining a continued ownership interest in SRII Opco or us. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for a discussion of the Tax Receivable Agreement and the related likely benefits to be realized by us and the TRA Holders.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the TRA Holders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a TRA Holder will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments\nfrom which to net against. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for a discussion of the Tax Receivable Agreement and the related likely benefits to be realized by us and the TRA Holders.\nCertain of the TRA Holders have substantial control over us, and their interests, along with the interests of other TRA Holders, in our business may conflict with the holders of our Class A Common Stock.\nThe TRA Holders may receive payments from us under the Tax Receivable Agreement upon any redemption or exchange of their SRII Opco Common Units, including the issuance of shares of our Class A Common Stock upon any such redemption or exchange. As a result, the interests of the TRA Holders may conflict with the interests of holders of our Class A Common Stock. For example, the TRA Holders may have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and whether and when we should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration tax or other considerations of TRA Holders even in situations where no similar considerations are relevant to us. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for a discussion of the Tax Receivable Agreement and the related likely benefits to be realized by us and the TRA Holders.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if we breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate and our obligations, or our successor\u2019s obligations, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become immediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in those circumstances is determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.\nAs a result of the foregoing, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to the TRA Holders that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (ii) we would be required to make a cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control due to the additional transaction costs a potential acquirer may attribute to satisfying such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nNon-U.S. holders may be subject to U.S. income tax with respect to gain on disposition of their Class A Common Stock and Public Warrants.\nWe believe that we are a United States real property holding corporation (a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d). As a result, non-U.S. holders that own (or are treated as owning under constructive ownership rules) more than a specified amount of our Class A Common Stock or Public Warrants during a specified time period may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a sale, exchange, or other disposition of such Class A Common Stock or Public Warrants and may be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return. If you are a Non-U.S. holder, we urge you to consult your tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of such treatment.", "PERMNO": 16677, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "AMRQQ"}
