{"cik": "791915", "company": "CYPRESS SEMICONDUCTOR CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe announcement and pending agreement to be acquired by Infineon may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price.\nUncertainty about the effect of our pending acquisition (the \"Merger\") by Infineon Technologies AG (\"Infineon\") on our senior leaders, employees, partners, customers, and other third parties may disrupt our sales and marketing or other key business activities and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price. We are subject to risks in connection with the announcement and pendency of the Merger including the following:\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of the pending Merger may cause our existing customers to investigate alternatives and/or switch to alternate suppliers;\n\u2022\nother parties with whom we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of those relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties, or seek to alter their present business relationships with us;\n\u2022\nparties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties instead of us;\n\u2022\ncurrent and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger and we might not be able to attract, recruit, retain, and motivate key talent, including senior leaders, to the same extent that we have previously been able to attract, recruit, retain, and motivate employees;\n\u2022\nlegal proceedings challenging the Merger may divert management time and attention, may require us to incur significant attorneys' fees and other expenses, and may result in unfavorable outcomes that could delay or prevent the Merger from being completed;\n\u2022\nrestrictions in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 3, 2019, by and among Infineon, its subsidiary IFX Merger Sub, Inc., and the Company (the \"Merger Agreement\") may prevent us from pursuing\nopportunities without Infineon\u2019s approval or taking other actions that we might have undertaken in the absence of the Merger, and may affect our ability to execute our business strategies, respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry developments, and attain our financial and other goals (including with respect to our current and prospective employees and parties with whom we have or seek to establish business relationships);\n\u2022\nrestrictions in the Merger Agreement on our ability to pursue alternative transactions to the Merger could, in specified circumstances, require us to pay Infineon a termination fee of $330 million, and could otherwise discourage or deter a third party from considering or proposing an alternative transaction with us; and\n\u2022\nwe have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management and other internal resources towards the completion of the Merger.\nAny failure of our pending acquisition by Infineon to be completed may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nWe face a risk that the proposed acquisition of the Company by Infineon might not be completed. Each of our and Infineon\u2019s obligations to complete the Merger was originally subject to a number of conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, including, among others: (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Cypress common stock; (ii) the absence of any law prohibiting or order preventing the completion of the Merger; (iii) the receipt of clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \"HSR Waiting Period\"), the receipt of any applicable clearance or affirmative approval by the Anti-Monopoly Bureau of the State Administration for Market Regulation in the People\u2019s Republic of China, approval from the European Commission under the European Merger Regulation, and the expiration of any applicable waiting periods or any applicable authorizations or affirmative approvals of certain other non-U.S. governmental authorities under antitrust laws; (iv) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to Cypress; and (v) compliance in all material respects on the part of each of Cypress and Infineon with such party\u2019s covenants under the Merger Agreement.\nAs of February 19, 2020, stockholder approval for the Merger has been obtained, and the proposed transaction has received antitrust clearances from authorities in the United States, the European Union, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Japan. The parties require approval for the proposed transaction from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and from China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). There can be no assurance that the remaining conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. If the Merger is not completed, Cypress's stockholders will not receive the proposed Merger consideration.\nRegulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of the required regulatory clearances and approvals described above. In that case, lengthy negotiations may ensue among these regulatory or governmental entities, Infineon and us, which could delay the closing (and any receipt of Merger consideration) and increase the risk that the merger might not be completed.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our share price could fall to the extent that our current share price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed. Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, and these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the Merger is completed;\n\u2022\nthe failure of the Merger to be completed may result in adverse publicity and a negative impression of us in the financial markets and investment community, and negative responses from customers, partners and other third parties;\n\u2022\nlegal proceedings may be instituted against us, our directors and others relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nany disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the acquisition, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, vendors and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the Merger is not completed, and we might be unable to recover business that was lost or win back customers who migrated to other suppliers due to merger uncertainty;\n\u2022\nwe could be required to pay a termination fee of up to $330 million to Infineon under certain circumstances as described in the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to take advantage of alternative business opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nwe might incur additional costs related to employee retention.\nUnfavorable economic and market conditions, domestically and internationally, have affected and may in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or may contribute to uncertainty of our business.\nWe have significant customer sales both in the U.S. and internationally. We also rely on U.S. and international suppliers, manufacturing partners and distributors. We are therefore susceptible to adverse U.S. and international economic and market conditions. If any of our manufacturing partners, customers, distributors or suppliers experience serious financial difficulties or cease operations, our business will be adversely affected and such effects may be material. In addition, the adverse impact of an unfavorable economy on consumers, including high unemployment rates, may adversely impact consumer spending, which would adversely impact demand for many end products in which our products are embedded. Any reduction in our customers' sales of their end-products, and/or any apprehension among our distributors and customers of a possible reduction in such sales, would likely cause an indirect negative impact on our own sales. Even prior to a widespread economic downturn, the related uncertainty and the market's fear of deteriorating conditions might cause our distributors and customers to place fewer orders for our products. Moreover, commodity prices may be more volatile in times of economic turmoil. High or volatile commodity prices increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect consumers' discretionary spending. As a result of the difficulty that businesses (including our customers) may have in obtaining credit and the decreased consumer spending that occurs during a recession, global economic turmoil (or uncertainty and apprehension over the possibility of economic turmoil), are likely to have an adverse impact from time to time on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and such effects may be material.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile due to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, and each of which could adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 value.\nThe trading price of our common stock is influenced by various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nRevenue fluctuations due to unexpected shifts in customer demand;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements about our earnings or the earnings of our competitors that are not in line with analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nOur ability to execute on our long term strategic corporate transformation initiatives, collectively known as our Cypress 3.0 initiatives;\n\u2022\nCredit conditions and our ability to refinance our existing debt at commercially reasonable terms, which may limit the Company\u2019s working capital;\n\u2022\nQuarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, design wins, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nThe perceptions of general market conditions in the semiconductor industry (including recent trends toward consolidation in the semiconductor industry) and global market conditions;\n\u2022\nOur ability to develop and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nAny major change in our board or senior management;\n\u2022\nChanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory compliance that impact our business;\n\u2022\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates concerning us, our customers or competitors;\n\u2022\nThe volume of short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions on shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions and growth expectations in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nChanges in our policy regarding dividends or our ability to declare a dividend;\n\u2022\nChanges in our policy regarding stock repurchases or our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nSupply disruption or price increases from third-party manufacturing partners;\n\u2022\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow to repay debt and;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in and results of litigation.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the trading price for our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nFurther, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and earnings per share. We may be unable to meet our payment obligations.\nWe incur indebtedness to finance our operations and we have substantial amounts of outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements. Our credit facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including a maximum total leverage ratio. Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations and covenants under our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There is no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing (or any amended) credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet payment obligations under any indebtedness we may incur from time to time. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations or meet required debt covenants, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement any of these alternatives on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under any indebtedness we owe. In addition, an inability to meet our payment obligations under any indebtedness may trigger a default, and possible acceleration of payment terms, under the applicable debt financing agreements.\nFurthermore, the interest rate on certain of these instruments is tied to short term interest rate benchmarks including the Prime Rate and LIBOR. Interest rates have remained at historically low levels for a prolonged period of time. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings changes it could increase our debt-related expenditures or may result in losses on our interest rate swaps. There is no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing (or any amended) credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet payment obligations (including any increased interest payment obligations) under any indebtedness we may incur from time to time.\nThe principal amount of our debt outstanding as of December 29, 2019 was $749.5 million which primarily included:\n\u2022\n$300 million under our Revolving Credit Facility\n\u2022\n$150 million of our 2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023\n\u2022\n$287.5 million of our 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 and\n\u2022\n$12 million of Spansion's 2% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2020\nSee Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our debt obligations.\nThe exchange or conversion, as applicable, of the Spansion Notes and the 2022 Notes could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders and negatively impact our financial position.\nThe exchange or conversion, as applicable, of some or all of Spansion's 2% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2020 (the \"Spansion Notes\") or our 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\") could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders and negatively impact our financial position. The Spansion Notes and the 2022 Notes are each exchangeable or convertible, as applicable, into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at the election of the holders of such series of notes upon the occurrence of certain conditions specified in the indenture governing such series of notes, including during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the exchange or conversion price of the applicable series of notes on each applicable trading day (the \"sales price condition\"). Any exchange or conversion, as\napplicable, of the Spansion Notes or 2022 Notes may be settled in cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, in each case at our election.\nThe sales price condition for the Spansion Notes and the 2022 Notes was met on the last trading day of the Company's fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2019 and, as a result, holders of the Spansion Notes and the 2022 Notes, as applicable, may, at their option, exchange or convert, as applicable, their notes during the Company\u2019s fiscal quarter ending March 29, 2020. If we elect to settle all or any portion of such exchanges or conversions of Spansion Notes or 2022 Notes, as applicable, in shares of our common stock, any sales in the public market of such common stock issued upon such exchange or conversion, as applicable, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Additionally, if we elect to settle all or any portion of such exchanges or conversions of Spansion Notes or 2022 Notes, as applicable, in cash, such payments of cash would reduce our available cash and negatively impact our liquidity.\nThe Spansion Notes and the 2022 Notes were similarly convertible during our fiscal quarters ended December 29, 2019 and September 29, 2019. During those periods, certain holders elected to convert or exchange an immaterial principle amount of such notes. We elected to settle the principal in cash and the conversion premium by issuing common stock.\nUncertainty about the continuing availability of LIBOR may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility (our \"Revolving Credit Facility\") bear interest at a floating rate which at our option may be based on the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). We also have entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate forward swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate. As described in Note 13, Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Derivatives, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, we pay the counterparties to these swap agreements a fixed rate in return for a LIBOR-based floating rate, which we use to fund payments under our Revolving Credit Facility. The aggregate notional amount of these swap agreements is $300 million.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that after December 31, 2021, it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. We cannot predict the effect of the FCA\u2019s decision not to sustain LIBOR or, if changes ultimately are made to LIBOR, the effect those changes may have on the interest we pay on our Revolving Credit Facility and the payments we receive under our interest rate forward swap agreements.\nIn anticipation of LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation, our Revolving Credit Facility agreement, as amended on July 31, 2019, provides a transition mechanism to a LIBOR-replacement rate to be mutually agreed upon by us and our lenders. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to reach an agreement with our lenders on any such replacement benchmark before experiencing adverse effects due to changes in interest rates, if at all. In addition, any such changes under the Revolving Credit Facility may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than payments we presently are obligated to make under our revolving credit facility. We also may seek to amend our swap agreements to replace the benchmark rate. There can be no assurance, however, that the counterparties to those agreements will agree to a replacement rate, and any such changes to the swap agreements may result in us receiving payments that are higher or lower than the payments we are entitled to receive under our existing swap agreements. There also can be no assurance that (a) the amounts we are entitled to receive under the swap agreements will continue to be correlated with the amounts we are required to pay under the Revolving Credit Facility or (b) transitions to new benchmarks will be concurrent across our various agreements, the failure of either or both of which could diminish the swaps\u2019 effectiveness as hedging instruments. Any of these risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we fail to compete successfully in our highly competitive industry and markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed.\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive. This intense competition results in a difficult operating environment that is marked by erosion of average selling prices over the life of each product and rapid technological change resulting in limited product life cycles. In order to offset selling price decreases, we attempt to decrease the manufacturing costs of our products and to introduce new, higher priced products that incorporate differentiated and advanced features. If these efforts are not successful or do not occur in a timely manner, or if our newly introduced products do not gain market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully execute on our long term strategic corporate transformation initiatives, collectively known as our Cypress 3.0 initiatives;\n\u2022\nour success in developing and marketing new products, software platforms and manufacturing technologies and bringing them to market on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe quality and price of our products, and our ability to meet the specification requirements of our customers;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of our customer base to absorb any increase in the price at which we sell our products;\n\u2022\nthe pace at which customers incorporate our products into their systems, as is sometimes evidenced by design wins;\n\u2022\nthe diversity of our product lines;\n\u2022\nthe cost effectiveness of our design, development, manufacturing, support and marketing efforts, especially as compared to our competitors;\n\u2022\nour success in developing and introducing firmware in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour customer service and customer satisfaction;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully execute our flexible manufacturing strategy;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully execute acquisitions of other companies;\n\u2022\nthe number, strength and nature of our competitors, the markets they target and the rate and success of their technological advances;\n\u2022\nthe success of certain of our development activities including our investments in internal and external development stage startups;\n\u2022\nour ability to get competitive terms with our vendors, manufacturing partners and suppliers;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain supply of products from third-party manufacturers; and\n\u2022\nour access to and the availability of working capital.\nAlthough we believe we currently compete effectively in the above areas to the extent they are within our control, given the pace of change in our industry (including recent trends toward consolidation in the industry), our current abilities are not guarantees of future success. If we are unable to compete successfully in this environment, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed.\nWe face significant volatility in supply and demand conditions for our products, and this volatility, as well as any failure by us to accurately forecast future supply and demand conditions, could materially and negatively impact our business.\nThe semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in the demand for, and supply of, semiconductors. Demand for our products depends in large part on the continued growth of various electronics industries that use our products, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nautomotive applications including advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), instrument clusters, infotainment systems, body electronics, connectivity, HVAC controls, and event data recorders;\n\u2022\nindustrial systems including factory automation equipment, smart electric meters, aerospace, industrial controls, point-of-sale terminals and test equipment;\n\u2022\nWireless products including smart home applications, health and fitness, audio, automotive, medical and industrial devices;\n\u2022\nconsumer electronics including wearable electronics, smartphones and other mobile devices, gaming consoles, remote controls, toys, presenter tools, TVs, set-top boxes and fitness equipment;\n\u2022\nwireless telecommunications equipment;\n\u2022\ncomputers and computer-related peripherals;\n\u2022\nmedical equipment; and\n\u2022\nnetworking equipment.\nAny downturn, shift in product launch schedule or reduction in the growth of these industries could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, pricing in the semiconductor industry is subject to significant volatility. As an example, pricing of memory products during fiscal 2017 was significantly impacted by industry conditions. We may be unable to anticipate or manage price volatility which may adversely impact our margins, market share, financial condition and results of our operations.\nWe order materials and build our products based primarily on our internal forecasts, and customer and distributor forecasts and secondarily on existing orders, which may be canceled under many circumstances. Because our markets can be volatile, based on consumer demand and subject to rapid technological changes, our forecasts may be inaccurate, causing us to make too many or too few of certain products.\nOur customers frequently place orders requesting product delivery almost immediately after the order is made, which makes forecasting customer demand even more difficult, particularly when supply is abundant. In addition, demand for our products could be materially different from our expectations due to changes in customer order patterns, including order deferrals or cancellations. If we experience inadequate demand, order cancellations, or a significant shift in the mix of product orders that makes our existing capacity and capability inadequate, our fixed costs per semiconductor produced will increase, which will harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlternatively, if we should experience a sudden increase in demand, we will need to quickly ramp our inventory and/or manufacturing capacity to adequately respond to our customers. If we or our manufacturing partners are unable to ramp our inventory or manufacturing capacity in a timely manner or at all, we risk losing our customers\u2019 business, which could have a negative impact on our financial performance and reputation.\nIf we fail to develop, introduce and sell new products or fail to develop and implement new technologies, our ability to compete in our end markets will suffer and our financial results could be adversely impacted.\nLike many semiconductor companies, which operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment marked by rapid obsolescence of existing products, our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products that customers choose to buy. Our new products, for example PSoC\u00ae products, our wireless connectivity products, USB-C, and Traveo\u2122 microcontroller products, are an important strategic focus for us and therefore, they tend to consume a significant amount of our resources. The new products the market requires tend to be increasingly complex, incorporating more functions including software and security and operating at faster speeds than old products.\nIncreasing complexity generally requires additional features on a smaller chip. This makes manufacturing new generations of products substantially more difficult, costly and time consuming than prior generations.\nDespite the significant amount of resources we commit to new products, there can be no guarantee that such products will perform as expected or at all, be introduced on time to meet customer schedules or gain market acceptance. If we fail to introduce new product designs or technologies in a timely manner, or are unable to manufacture products according to these design requirements, or if our customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating our products or if market demand for our new products does not materialize as anticipated, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nThe complex nature of our manufacturing activities, our broad product portfolio, and our increasing reliance on third-party manufacturers makes us highly susceptible to manufacturing problems and these problems can have a substantial negative impact on us if they occur.\nManufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in tightly controlled, clean-room environments. Even very small impurities in our manufacturing materials, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer or other problems in the wafer fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of products to be rejected and be non-functional. We and, similarly, our third-party foundry partners, may experience problems in achieving an acceptable success rate in the manufacture of wafers and the likelihood of facing such difficulties is higher due to our broad product portfolio and also in connection with the transition to new manufacturing methods. We may also experience manufacturing problems in our assembly and test operations (or the assembly and test operations of third-party partners) and in the introduction of new packaging materials.\nOur long-term growth strategy depends, in large part, upon winning and maintaining business from automotive industry customers as their designs call for increasing semiconductor content per vehicle over time. Automotive industry customers have a particularly low tolerance for defective parts. If we fail to maintain high quality standards, or if we fail to correct quality problems quickly after they arise, we risk the loss of existing orders, which could cause short-term revenue shortfalls, as well as the loss of future orders and customer confidence, which could undermine our automotive growth strategy.\nIn general, the interruption of wafer fabrication, a reduction in available wafer supply, the failure to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields, or the inability to achieve acceptable levels of quality and security in our products as expected by our customers, including our customers in the automotive industry, at any of our facilities, or the facilities of our third-party foundry partners, would seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on third parties to manufacture products, market products, distribute products, generate a significant portion of our product sales, fulfill our customer orders, and transport our products. Problems in the performance or availability of these companies could seriously harm our financial performance.\nWe rely significantly on independent contractors to manufacture our products, which includes wafer fabrication, assembly, packaging and testing.\nIn March 2017, we divested a wafer fabrication facility (commonly called a fab or foundry) located in Bloomington, Minnesota, which reduced our internal manufacturing capacity though we continue to outsource manufacturing services from this facility. The purchaser operates the fabrication facility as a stand-alone business that manufactures wafers for Cypress and for other companies. Although this transaction reduced our manufacturing footprint, it increased our reliance on third-party suppliers. Accordingly, if the owner of this Bloomington fabrication facility is unable to effectively operate the facility, faces financial difficulty, or is otherwise unable to meet our product demands, our supply of components may be adversely affected. Such events could lead to difficulties in delivering products to our customers on time and have a negative impact on our revenue and financial results.\nIf market demand for our products exceeds our internal manufacturing capacity and available capacity from our foundry partners, we may seek additional foundry manufacturing arrangements. A shortage in foundry manufacturing capacity, which is more likely to occur at times of increasing demand, could hinder our ability to meet demand for our products and therefore adversely affect our operating results. Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to commodity price increases, capacity constraints or other factors, which may lead to supply interruptions which could materially harm our results of operations. In addition, greater demand for wafers produced by any such foundries without an offsetting increase in foundry capacity raises the likelihood of potential shortages and wafer price increases. Our operations would be disrupted if any of our foundry partners terminates its relationship with us, delays its shipments to us, or experiences financial difficulty and we are unable to arrange a satisfactory alternative to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner. There are also only a few foundry vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture our most advanced products. If we need to engage alternate sources of supply, such sources may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Supply chain changes in the semiconductor industry are complicated, time-consuming, and costly and may disrupt longstanding business relationships that are otherwise advantageous. Due to the difficulty of engaging alternate sources of supply, if any of our key manufacturing facility partners experiences financial difficulties, we may accelerate purchases or commit to increase our purchases in order to build up inventories as a precautionary\nmeasure; however, this approach might increase our inventory carrying costs and expose us to inventory risks. Even if we are able to engage alternate sources of supply, we may encounter start-up difficulties or yield issues or incur additional costs. Shipments could be delayed significantly while these alternate sources are engaged and qualified for volume production.\nWhile some of our products are assembled, packaged and tested at our manufacturing facilities located in the Philippines and Thailand, we rely on independent subcontractors to assemble, package and test the balance of our products. We cannot be certain that these subcontractors will continue to assemble, package and test products for us on acceptable economic and quality terms or at all and it might be difficult for us to find alternatives if they do not do so.\nOur foundry partners and assembly and test subcontractors have operations in locations that may suffer the impact of certain natural disasters and political risk, which could impact their ability to provide us with our products. We monitor these events closely, but if one of our third-party manufacturing partners were to suffer significant damage to its operations as a result of a natural disaster or other catastrophic events such as a pandemic, our ability to timely meet consumer demand would suffer which would materially harm our results of operations. For example, one of our foundry partners is located in Wuhan, China, which experienced business interruptions in early 2020 due to an outbreak of the novel coronavirus.\nWe also rely on channel partners, including distributors, resellers, and third-party sales representatives. We continue to expand and change our relationships with our channel partners. Worldwide sales through our distributors accounted for approximately 72% of our revenue in fiscal year 2019. We rely on many channel partners to assist us in creating customer demand, providing technical support and other value-added services to our customers, filling customer orders, and stocking our products. We face ongoing business risks due to our reliance on our channel partners to create and maintain customer relationships where we have a limited or no direct relationship. Should our relationships with our channel partners or their effectiveness decline, or as we choose to terminate some channel partner relationships from time to time, we face the risk of declining demand which could affect our revenue and results of operations. Such decline could be short-term, as we work to build in-house capacity or otherwise replace the affected channel partners, or long-term if the replacements are less efficient at accessing end customers. In addition, some of our channel partners are affiliated with companies from which we source materials or with which we have other business relationships, so any deterioration in our dealings with such a channel partner may disrupt the broader relationship. Our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party upon notice. The termination of a significant distributor, reseller, or sales representative could (a) impact our revenue and limit our access to certain end customers, (b) result in the return of a material amount of inventory held by a terminated distributor or reseller that we may not be able to resell or have to resell at a loss, and (c) jeopardize our ability to collect accounts receivable originating through a terminated distributor or reseller. In addition, our distributors are located all over the world and vary in size and financial strength. Any disruptions to our distributors\u2019 operations such as lower sales, lower earnings, debt downgrades, the inability to access capital markets and/or higher interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business.\nFor example, effective in October 2019 we terminated a distribution relationship in Japan with Fujitsu Electronics Inc. (\"FEI\") following its breach of our agreement. We face a risk that we might not be able to market our products successfully to end customers who previously purchased our products through FEI, which could cause our revenue and results of operations to decline. FEI has also initiated litigation against us in California alleging our termination of the distribution agreement to be in breach of contract; such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe also rely on independent carriers and freight haulers to move our products between manufacturing plants and our customers\u2019 facilities. Transport or delivery problems due to their error or because of unforeseen interruptions in their business due to factors such as strikes, political instability, terrorism, natural disasters or accidents could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately impact our relationship with our customers.\nFinally, our customers source a variety of materials from various suppliers in addition to Cypress. The failure by third-party suppliers to meet our customers' materials requirements on a timely basis could negatively impact our customers' manufacturing schedules and reduce or delay our customers' demand for our products. For example, in 2018 a shortage of multi-layer ceramic capacitors, or MLCCs (a necessary component on many printed circuit boards), created challenges for manufacturers in multiple end markets. To the extent our customers experience\nshortages of necessary materials, they may be forced to slow production of their end products, with a corresponding decline in the rate at which they purchase materials from us.\nWe may not be able to consume minimum commitments under our \u201ctake or pay\u201d agreements, which may have a material adverse impact on our earnings.\nWe have entered into agreements with certain vendors that include \"take or pay\" terms. Take or pay terms obligate us to purchase a minimum required amount of services or make specified payments in lieu of such purchase. We may not be able to consume minimum commitments under these take or pay terms, requiring payments to vendors, which may have a material adverse impact on our earnings.\nFailures in our products (including security vulnerabilities, defects or other errors) as well as harms caused by the devices in which our products are embedded could expose us to significant costs and damage our business.\nWe are subject to the risks of product defects and products liability. Our products are inherently complex and from time to time defects or errors are detected only after the products are in use. Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or obtain through acquisitions, may also contain defects. The design process interface in new domains of technology and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes are complex and add risk to the design and manufacturing process. The use of devices containing our products to access untrusted content can further create a risk of exposing our products to viral or malicious activities. While we continue to focus on security issues and are taking measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, (including maintaining a rapid response team to investigate and respond to reports of security vulnerabilities) device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more data and processes and increasing the risk of security failures.\nUnder our sales terms, we generally warrant our products will conform to published specifications and be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year, and we limit product warranty remedies to a credit of the original purchase price, repair, or replacement. Risk of warranty claims may be greater from our strategic automotive customers, where quality standards are particularly high. Although our selling terms generally disclaim such liability, we face a risk that we might be held liable for other remedies, including consequential damages resulting from errors or defects in our products, that exceed our standard warranty remedies.\nFurther, the utilization of our products (and our customers' devices in which our products are embedded) by end users entails other products liability risks. We could face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to defects or errata. These risks may increase where our products are used in medical devices or other devices or systems relating to human health and safety.\nBecause our products and services are responsible for critical functions in our customers\u2019 products, defects or errata or security flaws in our products or services could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and/or on the end users of our customers\u2019 products. Such adverse impacts could include product liability claims; product recalls; write-offs of our inventories, property, plant and equipment and/or intangible assets; costs of providing product refunds, repairs, or replacements as well as reimbursements of customer costs; unfavorable purchase commitments; a shift of business to our competitors; a decrease in demand for our products; damage to our reputation and to our customer relationships; costs of litigation defense and and/or damages; fines imposed by regulatory agencies; and other financial liability or harm to our business. The materialization of any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nSystem security risks, data protection or privacy breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or the operations of our suppliers and customers and/or harm our reputation, and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in revenue, increase our expenses, negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price.\nLike most technology companies, we are subject to cyber-attacks from time to time. We face a risk that experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information, potentially without being detected. Computer programmers and hackers may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software\nprograms that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nSimilarly, cyber-attacks against our significant customers or suppliers could disrupt their ability to place orders from us or supply materials to us which could result in lost revenue and impact our ability to deliver our products to customers on a timely basis.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business on internal networks as well as on remote internet-connected third-party servers (sometimes called the \"cloud\"). Breaches of our security measures or those of our cloud services providers could create system disruptions or cause shutdowns or result in the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation, fines imposed by regulatory agencies, and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nPortions of our IT infrastructure also experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time, which may have a material impact on our business. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive than originally anticipated. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions have adversely affected us in the past, and in the future, could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nChanges in U.S. and international tax legislation and tax policy could materially impact our business.\nA majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S. and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the U.S. In the past, tax administrations globally have considered initiatives which could substantially eliminate utilization or reduce our ability to claim net operating losses and foreign tax credits, and eliminate various tax deductions. If any of these proposals are enacted into law, they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with these intercompany transactions or other matters and may assess additional taxes or adjust taxable income on our tax returns as a result. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In addition, uncertainties related to the interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 could materially impact our tax obligations and effective tax rate, as well as our business strategy and tax planning.\nOur effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws. In addition, various tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered that could significantly impact our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the \u201cOECD\u201d) has recently recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles. If countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our tax liabilities. Any of these changes could affect our financial performance.\nIf the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated in Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand change or cease to be in effect or applicable, in part or in whole, for any reason, or if our assumptions and\ninterpretations regarding tax laws and incentive or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect, the amount of corporate income taxes we have to pay could significantly increase.\nWe have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to the Company in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Each tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. The tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates within the next five years, subject in certain cases to potential extensions, which we may or may not be able to obtain. Absent these tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate in these jurisdictions that would otherwise apply to us would be between 20% and 30%. The tax incentives that we have negotiated are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive, we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. Depending on the incentive at issue, we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nWe have in the past and may in the future dispose of certain businesses, product lines or assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we have divested certain businesses, product lines or assets, acquired or otherwise, that are no longer strategically important, and exited minority investments, and we may do so in the future, which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations. If we decide to divest another business, product line, or assets, we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing such divestiture opportunity (or alternative exit strategy) on acceptable terms or in a timely manner. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to the business, product line or assets that we seek to dispose. In addition, any delay in the timing of a divestiture transaction may negatively impact our business operations or liquidity for a period of time. Alternatively, we may dispose of businesses, product lines, or assets at prices or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated. Even following a divestiture, we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers, vendors, landlords, or other third parties. Accordingly, we may be dependent on the new owner (of such business, product line or manufacturing facility) to fulfill our continuing obligations to our customers. We may also have continuing obligations for pre-existing liabilities related to the divested assets or businesses. Such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Any such dispositions could also result in disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers (especially if the new owner is unable or unwilling to assist us in fulfilling any continuing obligations to our customers), potential loss of revenue, negative impact on our margins, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or result in ongoing obligations and liabilities to us following any such divestiture. We may also incur significant costs associated with exit or disposal activities, related impairment charges, or both.\nOne type of divestiture is contribution of the applicable business, product lines, or assets to a joint venture in exchange for an interest in the venture, which exposes us to the risk that the joint venture might decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of joint venture investments depends on various factors over which Cypress might have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. Such risks could be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of any joint venture investment could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.\nOur joint venture for NAND flash memory products might not be successful.\nOn April 1, 2019, we launched a joint venture in Hong Kong with SK hynix system ic Inc. (\"SKHS\"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SK hynix Inc. (\"SKH\"), a South Korean company. We contributed our NAND flash memory business to the joint venture, which is named SkyHigh Memory Limited. NAND is a commoditized product line that has traditionally experienced volatile sales results with low gross margins. Upon launch, SkyHigh entered into a wafer supply agreement with SKH, and back-end manufacturing and transition services agreements with Cypress.\nSkyHigh is not under our control and we might be unaware of, or unable to correct, any operating or product issues that may develop. Any failure by SkyHigh to satisfy customer expectations could adversely impact our own relationships with such customers and/or the reputation of our brand. Any failure by SkyHigh to meet its commitments to Cypress under our back-end manufacturing agreement could cause Cypress's assembly and testing facilities to be underutilized and could adversely affect Cypress's operating margins. In addition, there can be no assurance that the joint venture will be profitable. We therefore face a risk that our investment might not generate meaningful cash flows to re-invest, for example, in higher-margin areas of our business. The success of this joint venture investment will depend on various other factors over which we may have limited or no control and will require ongoing and effective cooperation with SKHS, which might be difficult to maintain. Such risks could be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions, causing the value of this joint venture investment to decline and leading to impairment charges. Any failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the joint venture could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe might engage in additional restructuring activities which could be disruptive to our business and adversely impact our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we have implemented restructuring plans to reduce our operating costs and/or shift our expenditures to different areas of our business. However, if we have not sufficiently reduced operating expenses or if revenues are below our expectations, or if we otherwise decide to restructure our operations, we may be required to engage in additional restructuring activities, which could result in additional restructuring charges. These restructuring charges could harm our results of operations. Further, our restructuring plans could result in potential adverse effects on employee capabilities, on our ability to achieve design wins, and our ability to maintain and enhance our customer base. Such events could harm our efficiency and our ability to act quickly and effectively in the rapidly changing technology markets in which we sell our products. In addition, we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to realign our organizational structure and shift our investments and focus to our high-growth businesses.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted if privately-held companies in which we have invested fail to launch new products or maintain key customer relationships.\nWe have invested in certain privately-held companies. There can be no guarantee that such businesses will perform as initially expected, launch new products and solutions as initially expected, or gain or maintain market acceptance. When the value of a privately-held investment declines, we may be required to record an impairment of the investment's carrying value on our books. For example:\n\u2022\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we determined that our investment in Enovix Corporation, which is accounted for as an equity method investment, was other-than-temporarily impaired as Enovix did not achieve key planned product development milestones. Consequently, we recognized an impairment charge of $51.2 million related to our investment in Enovix, reducing the carrying value of such investment on our books to zero.\n\u2022\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we determined that our investment in Deca Technologies Inc. (\"Deca\") was other-than temporarily impaired due to significant delays in Deca's commercialization and achievement of scalable production of certain key products, and consequently we recognized an impairment charge of $41.5 million to write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca to $65.1 million (the estimated fair value of our investment as of the end of fiscal 2018).\n\u2022\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we determined that our investment in Deca had become further impaired due to a significant reduction in orders from Deca's key customers, and based on other objective indicators of enterprise value. Consequently, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $29.5 million to write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca to $28.6 million (the estimated fair value of our investment as of June 30, 2019).\nIf these or any of our other privately-held businesses fail to introduce new products and solutions or successfully develop new technologies, or if their customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating the products or solutions offered by these businesses, or if market demand for the products or solutions offered by these businesses is not created or sustained, or if these or any of our other privately-held businesses are not able to raise capital to fund their operations, then we might fail to realize any benefit from our investments in such privately-held companies and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially harmed as a result of impairment of the carrying value of such investments.\nIn particular, there is a substantial risk that the carrying value of our investment in Deca may become further impaired. Deca's current and future revenue is dependent on a small number of significant customers. On October\n1, 2019, Deca reached a definitive agreement with nepes Corporation (\u201cnepes\u201d) to sell Deca\u2019s Philippines manufacturing facility to nepes, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. As part of the agreement, nepes has licensed certain Deca technologies, and nepes will purchase a limited number of Deca\u2019s shares from certain existing shareholders which may include Cypress. The agreement provides for milestone-based payments from nepes to Deca both for the Philippines manufacturing facility purchase and the technology license, which milestones are currently expected to be achieved in 2020. The transfer of Deca's manufacturing facility to nepes closed on January 1, 2020. Following the closing, Deca's remaining assets primarily consist of intellectual property and its new business model will focus on monetizing its intellectual property portfolio as well as providing engineering services. Conditions that may have a material adverse effect on Deca\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition or on its enterprise value include:\n\u2022\nany delays or failure to complete product or intellectual property development milestones-similar to those previously experienced by Deca in fiscal 2018;\n\u2022\nany inability of Deca to raise sufficient funding, if needed, for continuing its operations; and\n\u2022\nany inability of Deca to monetize its intellectual property assets.\nIf any of the above risks materialize, we may be required to record further impairment charges to partially or fully write down the carrying value of our investment in Deca. As of December 29, 2019, we held 52.4% of Deca's outstanding voting shares and the carrying value of our investment in Deca was $25.1 million.\nAcquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions have been an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital. We may from time to time evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and may continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to integration challenges;\n\u2022\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nSuccessfully transitioning the current customer, supplier, foundry and other partnering relationships of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\n\u2022\nIntegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\nIn the case of acquired companies with global operations, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022\nFailure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology;\n\u2022\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nPending litigation or other known or unknown claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims by stockholders for breach of fiduciary duties, terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\n\u2022\nTo the extent a purchase agreement includes a non-competition and/or non-solicitation commitment by the seller, any breach or expiration of such commitment may expose us to additional competition if the seller decides to re-enter the relevant market or attempts to hire back its employees.\nOur failure to address these and other risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or current acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Current and future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition or results. As a result, the anticipated benefit of any of our acquisitions may not be realized.\nIn 2016, we incurred a material impairment charge with respect to our goodwill, and we may in the future incur impairments in the value of our goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment annually, and more frequently when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In 2016, we conducted impairment testing on the goodwill in our legacy Programmable Solutions Division (\"PSD\") and recorded an impairment charge of $488.5 million. In addition, our other long-lived assets which include intangibles and property, plant and equipment are evaluated for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Either of these situations may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected income or cash flow. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we reorganized our reportable segments as a result of which goodwill was reallocated to new segments. We continue to evaluate current conditions to assess whether any impairment exists. Additional impairments could occur in the future if any of the following occur: deterioration in market or interest rate environments, significant adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers, changes in technology, declines in future cash flows of our reporting units, or material changes in reporting unit carrying values compared with changes in their respective fair values.\nWe compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to attract, such personnel would harm us.\nTo a greater degree than most non-technology companies, we depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and technical personnel to execute on the strategic initiatives of our business. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly skilled engineers. We compete for these individuals with certain of our competitors, other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. Competition for such personnel, particularly in the Silicon Valley, is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel. Furthermore, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Equity awards are critical to our ability to hire and retain such key personnel, and any reduction in the price of our common stock (and accordingly the value of such equity awards) may reduce the willingness of key personnel to remain employed by the Company. In addition, we may also need to significantly increase our cash-based compensation to retain such personnel.\nOur business may also be impacted if we lose members of our senior management team. Any disruption in management continuity could impact our results of operations and stock price and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, changes in key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. The loss of any of our key officers or other employees, or our inability to attract, integrate and retain qualified employees, could require us to dedicate significant financial and other resources to such personnel matters, disrupt our operations and seriously harm our operations and business.\nIf we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of additional shares for our share-based compensation award programs in the future, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel.\nOur compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, hire, motivate, and retain qualified personnel and our share-based compensation award programs provide us with a competitive compensatory tool for this purpose. The continued use of our share-based compensation program is necessary for us to compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of additional shares for our share-based compensation award programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel.\nThere can be no assurance we will continue to declare dividends.\nOur Board of Directors previously adopted a policy pursuant to which the Company would pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. The declaration and payment of any dividend or distribution is subject to the approval of our Board and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. There can be no assurance that we will declare dividends or distributions in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. Future dividends or distributions, if any, and their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors, management\u2019s views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; earnings levels; contractual restrictions; our cash position and overall financial condition; debt related payments and commitments, including restrictive covenants which may limit our ability to pay a dividend or distribution; changes in tax or corporate laws; our ability to repatriate cash into the United States; stock repurchase programs; the need to invest in research and development or other parts of our business operations; and changes to our business model. Accordingly, our dividend or other distribution payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or other distributions in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our dividend payments or a change in the tax treatment of future dividends could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nWe may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases and there can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares of our stock.\nIn October 2015, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed $450 million. Although our Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase program, the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares of our stock in any particular amounts, or at all. Any stock repurchases during the pendency of the Merger would require Infineon's consent. The stock repurchase plan could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice and in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. In fiscal 2017, we did not repurchase any shares in the open market under the stock repurchase plan. In fiscal 2018, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for a total cost of $35 million including the Yield Enhancement Program (\"YEP\"). YEPs are short-term structured agreements, typically with maturities of 90 days or less, correlated to our stock price that can settle either in return of cash or delivery of our shares. In fiscal 2019, we did not repurchase any shares of our stock from the open market.\nAny guidance that we may provide about our business or expected future results may differ significantly from actual results.\nFrom time to time we have shared our views in press releases or SEC filings, on public conference calls and in other contexts about current business conditions and our expectations as to our future results of operations. Correctly identifying the key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, especially in uncertain economic times. Given the complexity and volatility of our business, our analysis and forecasts have in the past and will likely in the future, prove to be incorrect. We offer no assurance that such predictions or analysis will ultimately be accurate, and investors should treat any such predictions or analysis with appropriate caution. If any analysis or forecast that we make ultimately proves to be inaccurate, our stock price may be adversely affected.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. Industry consolidation may result in stronger companies that are better able to compete with us. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights is essential to keeping others from copying the innovations that are critical to our existing and future products. It may be possible for an unauthorized third party to reverse-engineer or decompile our software products. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be respected by third parties. Furthermore, our flexible manufacturing initiative requires us to enter into technology transfer agreements with external partners, providing third-party access to our intellectual property and resulting in additional risk. In some cases, these technology transfer and/or license agreements are with foreign companies and subject our intellectual property to regulation in foreign countries which may afford less protection and/or result in increased costs to enforce such agreements or intellectual property rights. We anticipate that we will continue to enter into these kinds of licensing arrangements in the future. Consequently, we have in the past become involved and we may continue to be involved in litigation, in the United States or abroad, to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of invalidity. We may also from time to time continue to be involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others\u2019 patents or other intellectual property rights. Patent litigation, if necessary or when instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nMoreover, a key element of our strategy is to enter new markets with our products. If we are successful in entering these new markets, we will likely be subject to additional risks of potential infringement claims against us as our technologies are deployed in new applications and face new competitors. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights, particularly in certain international markets, making misappropriation of our intellectual property more likely. In August 2016, we entered into a series of agreements to divest a large number of older, legacy patents and we may in the future divest patents from time to time. The divestiture of patents may limit our ability to make certain legal claims, and to be successful, in future patent litigation.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection for our technology, in part through confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. Through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property documentation and other proprietary technology information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, former employees, consultants or third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality as our technology. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult, and nearly impossible on a worldwide basis. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where we do business or where our technology is sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where the enforcement of such laws is not common or effective.\nWe become involved in intellectual property litigation from time to time, which can be expensive and divert management attention and resources away from our business, and in which an adverse judgment or settlement may require us to pay substantial damages or prohibit us from using essential technologies.\nIntellectual property litigation and threats of litigation are very common in our industry. Other companies or entities have commenced, and may again commence, actions seeking to establish the invalidity of our patents. While we intend to defend these actions vigorously, there is no guarantee of success, and such effort takes significant financial and time resources from the Company. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may invalidate the patent(s) or determine that the patent(s) is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If our patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents is limited by a court or USPTO decision, we could be prevented from pursuing certain litigation matters or licensing the invalidated or limited portion of such patents. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact our future, expected revenue.\nIntellectual property litigation is frequently expensive to both the winning party and the losing party and could take up significant amounts of management\u2019s time and attention. In addition, if we lose such a lawsuit, a court could find that our intellectual property rights are invalid, enabling our competitors to use our technology, or require us to pay\nsubstantial damages and/or royalties or prohibit us from using essential technologies. In addition, in August 2016, we entered into a series of agreements to divest a large number of older, legacy patents and we may in the future divest patents from time to time. The divestiture of patents may limit our ability to make certain legal claims, and to be successful, in future patent litigation. For these and other reasons, intellectual property litigation could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, although in certain instances we may seek to obtain a license under a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us, we may be unable to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all. Even though we may have meritorious defenses and claims and defend and pursue such claims vigorously, all litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and may negatively impact our business.\nThe accumulation of changes in our shares by \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d have in the past and could again trigger an ownership change for U.S. income tax purposes, in which case our ability to utilize our net operating losses would be limited and therefore impact our future tax benefits.\nWe are a publicly traded company and our stockholders can change on a daily basis. These changes are beyond our control. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) restricts a company\u2019s ability to benefit from net operating losses or other deferred tax assets if a \u201cSection 382 Ownership Change\u201d occurs. An ownership change for purposes of U.S. tax law Section 382 may result from ownership changes that increase the aggregate ownership of \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d by more than 50 percentage points over a testing period, generally three years (\u201cSection 382 Ownership Change\u201d). We experienced a Section 382 Ownership Change upon our merger with Spansion Inc. (\"Spansion\") in March 2015. The resulting limitations accompanying the ownership change are reflected in our deferred tax assets.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist stockholders.\nThe actions of activist stockholders, including any related legal proceedings, could adversely affect our business. Specifically:\n\u2022\nresponding to common actions of an activist stockholder, such as public proposals and requests for special meetings, nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors, requests that certain executive officers or directors depart the Company, requests to make changes to internal business operations, requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or other special requests, could disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming or divert the attention of our management and employees;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of an activist stockholder, including any perceived changes at the board or management level, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable and need to make changes, which may be exploited by our competitors and make it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel as well as consumers and service providers;\n\u2022\nactions of an activist stockholder, especially any legal proceedings, may divert management time and attention away from execution on the Company\u2019s business operations and cause the Company to incur significant costs, including expenses related to legal, public relations, investment banking, and/or proxy advisory services - these expenses could have a material adverse impact on our financial results;\n\u2022\nthe election to our Board of Directors of director candidates who are not supported by the Company, may create unnecessary conflict and instability on our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nactions of an activist stockholder may cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions, unflattering media coverage, or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nOur settlement agreement with T.J. Rodgers, which resolved the 2017 proxy contest, expired on May 3, 2019, the date of our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.\nGeopolitical uncertainty, and changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, import and excise duties, taxes, or other governmental rules and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S. and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside the U.S. Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, include:\n\u2022\npolitical instability, and the possibility of a deteriorating relationship between the nations in which we do business and the United States;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of new or modified international trade restrictions, tariffs, import and excise duties or other taxes;\n\u2022\nimport and export requirements, including restrictions on sales to certain end customers;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, including potential intervention by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) or by other applicable administrative review boards to block strategic transactions that might otherwise be in our shareholders\u2019 interests;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n\u2022\nchanges in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;\n\u2022\na less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which, among other things, can create uncertainty regarding contract enforcement, intellectual property rights and liability issues;\n\u2022\ninadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act of 2010; and\n\u2022\npossible disruption of business relationships if any of the above risks disrupt our suppliers or customers' operations, or lead any of our suppliers or customers to relocate some portion of their international operations (for example, we might face a risk of delayed or lost sales if a customer were to move its manufacturing operations out of China due to concerns over tariffs or inadequate respect for intellectual property rights).\nThe U.S. federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. Any changes to the international trading system, or the emergence of an international trade dispute, could significantly impact our business and have a negative impact on our revenues. In addition, the U.S. and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties, tariffs and other taxes on our products in varying amounts. Any significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nFor example, our sales were impacted in the second quarter of 2018 when the U.S. Department of Commerce banned U.S. companies from exporting to ZTE, a Chinese telecoms equipment manufacturer (which ban was subsequently lifted in the third quarter of 2018) as part of an export controls enforcement action against ZTE. Similarly, our sales were impacted in the second quarter of 2019 when the U.S. Department of Commerce restricted sales of goods subject to U.S. jurisdiction to Huawei Technologies, a Chinese telecoms equipment and consumer electronics manufacturer. We face a risk that the U.S. might apply these or similar export controls to restrict sales to other buyers or impose additional restrictions on sales of goods to Huawei, any of which could impact our sales revenues.\nTrade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated in 2018 generally, and remained high in 2019, with rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods taking effect in July, August, and September of 2018 and May and September of 2019. Further increases scheduled for October 2019 were tabled as the two nations negotiated an initial (\"Phase One\") agreement to resolve some of their disputed trade issues. However, the Phase One agreement signed in January 2020 left most tariffs in place to be addressed at a later stage. Further rounds of tariffs have also been threatened by U.S. and Chinese leaders.\nThe current U.S. tariffs on China-origin goods and the related geopolitical uncertainty between the U.S. and China have caused, and may continue to cause, decreased demand for our products from distributors and other customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\n\u2022\nSeveral rounds of the U.S. tariffs apply to some of our products that are assembled in China and imported to the U.S. Specifically, the August 2018 round imposed a 25% tariff on integrated circuits, the September 2018 round imposed a 10% tariff on AgigA modules (which increased to 25% in May 2019) and the September 2019 round imposed a 15% tariff on BLE modules. As part of the Phase One agreement, the tariff on BLE modules will fall to 7.5% on February 24, 2020.\n\u2022\nProducts subject to U.S. tariffs on China-origin goods generated approximately 1.0% of our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019. These current and any future tariffs imposed by the U.S. on products assembled in China that we sell in the U.S. could negatively impact our U.S. sales.\n\u2022\nThe August 2018 round of U.S. tariffs also imposed a 25% duty on imports of China-origin integrated circuit wafers, which are among the components we include in our products. Although we import some such wafers for testing in the U.S., we then export them overseas for final assembly and/or distribution to customers. Accordingly, we have been able to avoid the wafer tariff to date by use of the \"temporary import bond\" (or TIB) process established by U.S. Customs, which requires that we separately track each wafer to ensure that, within one year of import, it is either re-exported or destroyed. If we fail to so track any such wafer, we would owe a double duty on the incoming shipment of which that wafer was a part. In addition, upon any such failure, U.S. Customs could (and upon repeated extreme failures U.S. Customs likely would) disallow further use of the TIB process, which would materially increase our production costs. In that case, we might be unable to secure alternate sources for wafers on a timely basis, or at all. In the semiconductor industry, supply chain changes are complicated, time-consuming, and costly, and may disrupt longstanding business relationships that are otherwise advantageous.\n\u2022\nApart from wafers, the current U.S. tariffs cover only a small fraction of the materials we utilize for manufacturing of our products. We do not anticipate any material impact on our supply chain costs from the U.S. tariffs imposed to date. If the U.S. were to impose tariffs on a broader range of materials that we or our suppliers source from China for use in U.S. manufacturing (and if we were unable to avoid the tariffs by use of the TIB process or other means), such tariffs could cause our costs to increase, which could narrow the profits we earn from sales of products requiring such materials or force us to raise prices, negatively impacting our sales. As mentioned above, the process of changing suppliers in order to mitigate any such tariff costs could be complicated, time-consuming, and costly.\n\u2022\nWe believe the U.S. tariffs may cause customers to delay orders as they evaluate where to take delivery of our products in connection with their efforts to mitigate their own tariff exposure. Such delays create forecasting difficulties for us and increase the risk that orders might be canceled or might never be placed.\n\u2022\nSome of our customers embed our products in finished goods they manufacture in China for import to the U.S. Current or future tariffs imposed by the U.S. on such goods could negatively impact our customers' sales, thereby causing an indirect negative impact on our own sales. Any reduction in our customers' sales, and/or any apprehension among distributors and customers of a possible reduction in such sales, would likely cause an indirect negative impact on our own sales. Even in the absence of further tariffs, the related uncertainty and the market's fear of an escalating trade war might cause our distributors and customers to place fewer orders for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\n\u2022\nTo date, China's retaliatory tariffs have generally focused on other industries. However, if China were to impose tariffs on the products we sell in China, or on the finished goods our customers sell in China, such tariffs (and/or the market's related uncertainty and apprehension) could directly or indirectly reduce demand for our products, negatively impacting our sales.\nWe could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. Any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.\nThese international economic and political uncertainties and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our, or our suppliers\u2019 and distributors\u2019, business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe face additional problems and uncertainties associated with international operations that could seriously harm us.\nInternational revenues historically accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues. Our manufacturing, assembly, and test operations and certain finance operations located outside of the United States, as well as our international sales offices and design centers, face risks frequently associated with foreign operations including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\nthe devaluation of local currencies;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, and the possibility of a deteriorating relationship between the nations in which we operate and the United States;\n\u2022\nlabor issues, including collective bargaining agreements;\n\u2022\nthe impact of natural disasters on local infrastructures and economies;\n\u2022\nchanges in local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nimport and export controls;\n\u2022\npotential shortage of power supply;\n\u2022\npotential violations by our international employees or third party agents of international or U.S. laws relevant to foreign operations (such as FCPA, UK Bribery Act of 2010); and\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, tariffs and freight rates.\nTo the extent any such risks materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nWe are subject to many different environmental, data privacy, health and safety laws, regulations and directives, and compliance with them may be costly.\nWe are subject to many different international, federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations related to, among other things, the storage, use, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process, conflict mineral and data privacy legislation, as well as the health and safety regulations related to our employees. Compliance with these regulations can be costly. There can be no assurance that we have been, or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible, without regard to fault, for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our or our predecessors\u2019 past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other environmental damage.\nProposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect in May 2018, applies to many of our products and services and regulates our processing of personal data of European employees, European customers, European sales leads, and other European business contacts. The GDPR provides significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\nOver the last several years, there has been increased public awareness of the potentially negative environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing operations. This attention and other factors may lead to changes in environmental regulations that could force us to purchase additional equipment or comply with other potentially costly requirements. If we fail to control the use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or future regulations, we could face substantial liability or suspension of our manufacturing operations, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the material composition of our products, including the restrictions on lead and other hazardous substances that apply to specified electronic products put on the market in the European Union, China and California. Other countries, including at the federal and state levels in the United States, are also considering similar laws and regulations. Certain electronic products that we maintain in inventory may be rendered obsolete if they are not in compliance with such laws and regulations, which could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from those products. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they will likely result in additional costs, or in the worst case decreased revenue, and could even require that we redesign or change how we manufacture our products. Such redesigns result in additional costs and possible delayed or lost revenue.\nWe face risks related to \"conflict minerals\" reporting.\nOur products contain materials that are subject to the SEC's conflict minerals reporting requirements. These requirements require companies to perform ongoing diligence, and to disclose and report whether or not such minerals in their products originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We file such reports annually with the SEC on Form SD. Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. Additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur worldwide operations could be adversely affected if disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, telecommunication or information technology system failures, regulatory or political issues, power or water shortages, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics or other man- made disasters or catastrophic events. These risks are exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations and those of our suppliers. While we maintain business interruption insurance for our facilities, the level and/or extent of coverage might not be sufficient to cover potential losses. Accordingly, the occurrence of any of these business disruptions for us or our third-party manufacturers, partners or customers could result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.\nThese negative effects could be particularly severe in the event of a widespread pandemic. For example, in early 2020 the novel coronavirus outbreak affected operations at one of our foundry partners in Wuhan, China, and increasingly has disrupted other product shipping and logistics operations in China. Concerns about the virus caused us to implement work-from-home rules at our facilities elsewhere in China. We also discouraged non-critical business travel worldwide and cancelled our participation in various international trade shows. As of the filing of this Annual Report, the extent to which the coronavirus will affect our business is uncertain. Even where our supply chain is unaffected, we may experience reduced demand to the extent our customers experience shortages of other necessary materials and are forced to slow production of their end products (with a corresponding decline in the rate at which they purchase materials from us) or to the extent our customers experience reduced consumer demand for their end-products as consumers curtail purchases. We may also experience delays in payments from some of our customers based in China. These risks will be exacerbated if the outbreak becomes widespread beyond China.\nIn regard to geographic concentration, our corporate headquarters, a portion of our research and development and manufacturing activities, the final assembly of our products, and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including California, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, China and India, many of which are on or near the Pacific \"ring of fire,\" which is characterized by active volcanoes, frequent earthquakes, and resulting tsunamis. In January 2020 our back-end manufacturing facility outside Manila in the Philippines was shut down for a few days due to ashfall from the Taal Volcano, located approximately 18 miles from our facility, and this facility may continue to experience disruption if there is new volcanic activity.\nThe ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure from pandemics, from natural disasters, and from being centralized in certain geographical areas or located near major earthquake faults is unknown. However, if the novel coronavirus outbreak continues or spreads, or in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, our ability to deliver products to customers on a timely basis may be impacted, we may see reduced demand for our products, we may incur remediation costs, and we may suffer a loss of inventory or assets, all of which may adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.\nChanges to Board of Directors and senior management may disrupt our operations, our strategic focus or our ability to drive stockholder value.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain key members of our senior management team and our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel for our Board and senior management positions. Turnover may disrupt our operations, our strategic focus or our ability to drive stockholder value. If we fail to attract new skilled personnel for our Board and senior management positions, our business and growth prospects could be adversely impacted.\nOur governing documents provide indemnities to our officers and directors for which we have purchased insurance. If material liabilities were to arise in excess of our insurance coverage, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted.\nOur certificate of incorporation, and by-laws require us to indemnify our officers and directors for certain liabilities that may arise in the course of their service to us, including their service at our request on the boards of other companies in which we invest such as Deca, SkyHigh, and Enovix. If we were required to pay a significant amount on account of these liabilities, or such liabilities were not covered by insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.", "PERMNO": 10302, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "CY"}
