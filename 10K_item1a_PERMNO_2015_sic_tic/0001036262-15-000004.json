{"cik": "1036262", "company": "INTEST CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our future performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us and we cannot predict every event and circumstance that may adversely affect our business. However, these risks and uncertainties are the most significant factors that we have identified at this time. If one or more of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations, and/or financial condition would likely suffer, and the price of our stock could be negatively affected.\nOur sales are affected by the cyclicality and seasonality of the semiconductor and ATE markets, which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nOur business depends in significant part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Capital expenditures by these companies depend upon, among other things, the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products that utilize them. Typically, semiconductor manufacturers curtail capital expenditures during periods of economic downturn. Conversely, semiconductor manufacturers increase capital expenditures when market demand requires the addition of new or expanded production capabilities or the reconfiguration of existing fabrication facilities to accommodate new products. In addition to being cyclical, the ATE market has also developed a seasonal pattern in the last several years, with the second and third quarters being the periods of strong demand and the first and fourth quarters being periods of weakened demand. We believe this change has been driven by the strong demand for consumer products containing semiconductor content sold during the year-end holiday shopping season. These market changes and seasonal sales pattern have contributed in the past, and will likely continue to contribute in the future, to fluctuations in our operating results.\n- 13 -\ninTEST CORPORATION\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nOur business is subject to intense competition.\nWe face significant competition throughout the world in each of our product segments. Some of our competitors have substantial financial resources and more extensive design and production capabilities than we do. In order to remain competitive, we must be able to continually commit a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to developing new products and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or technologies. Over the last several years, in response to significant declines in global demand for our products, some competitors have reduced their product pricing significantly, which has led to intensified price based competition, which has and could continue to materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe seek to further diversify the markets for our thermal products in order to increase the proportion of our sales attributable to markets which are less subject to cyclicality than the semiconductor and ATE markets. If we are unable to do so, our future performance will remain substantially exposed to the fluctuations of the cyclicality of the semiconductor and ATE markets.\nSince 2009, we have sold our thermal products in markets outside of the ATE market, including the automotive, consumer electronics, defense/aerospace, energy, industrial and telecommunications markets. Our sales to these non-ATE markets were $11.1 million in both 2014 and 2013 and represented 27% and 28%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues. Our goal is to increase our sales into these and other non-ATE markets; however, in most cases, the expansion of our thermal product sales into these new markets has occurred in the last several years, and we may experience difficulty in expanding our sales efforts further into these markets. These difficulties could include hiring sales and marketing staff with sufficient experience selling into these new markets and our ability to continue to develop products which meet the needs of customers in these markets and which are not currently offered by our competitors. If we are unable to expand our sales in non-ATE markets, our net revenues and results of operations will remain substantially dependent upon the cycles of the semiconductor and ATE markets.\nWe seek to acquire additional businesses. If we are unable to do so, our future rate of growth may be reduced or limited.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses, technologies or products that are complementary to our current product offerings. We seek to make acquisitions that will further expand our product lines as well as increase our exposure to markets outside the ATE market. We may not be able to execute our acquisition strategy if:\nwe are unable to identify suitable businesses, technologies or products to acquire;\nwe do not have sufficient cash or access to required capital at the necessary time; or\nwe are unwilling or unable to outbid larger, more resourceful companies.\nOur acquisition strategy involves financial and management risks which may adversely affect our results in the future.\nIf we acquire additional businesses, technologies or products, we will face the following additional risks:\nfuture acquisitions could divert management's attention from daily operations or otherwise require additional management, operational and financial resources;\nwe might not be able to integrate future acquisitions into our business successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably;\nwe may realize substantial acquisition related expenses which would reduce our net earnings in future years; and\nour investigation of potential acquisition candidates may not reveal problems and liabilities of the companies that we acquire.\nIf any of the events described above occur, our earnings could be reduced. If we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase our stock in connection with any future acquisitions, we would dilute our existing stockholders' interests and our earnings per share may decrease. If we issue debt in connection with any future acquisitions, lenders may impose covenants on us which could, among other things, restrict our ability to increase capital expenditures or to acquire additional businesses.\n- 14 -\ninTEST CORPORATION\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nOur operating results often change significantly from quarter to quarter and may cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nHistorically, our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter. We believe that these fluctuations occur primarily due to the cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. In addition to the changing cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry, other factors that have caused our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the past, and that may cause fluctuations and losses in the future, include:\nthe state of the U.S. and global economies;\nchanges in the buying patterns of our customers;\nchanges in our market share;\nthe technological obsolescence of our inventories;\nquantities of our inventories greater than is reasonably likely to be utilized in future periods;\nfluctuations in the level of product warranty charges;\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\nthe impairment of our assets due to reduced future demand for our products;\ncosts and timing of integration of our acquisitions and plant consolidations and relocations;\nexcess manufacturing capacity;\nour ability to control operating costs;\ncosts associated with implementing restructuring initiatives;\ndelays in shipments of our products;\nthe mix of our products sold;\nthe mix of customers and geographic regions where we sell our products;\nchanges in the level of our fixed costs;\ncosts associated with the development of our proprietary technology;\nour ability to obtain raw materials or fabricated parts when needed;\nincreases in costs of component materials;\ncancellation or rescheduling of orders by our customers;\nchanges in government regulations; and\npolitical or economic instability.\nBecause the market price of our common stock has tended to vary based on, and in relation to, changes in our operating results, fluctuations in the market price of our stock are likely to continue as variations in our quarterly results continue.\nChanges in the buying patterns of our customers have affected, and may continue to affect, demand for our products and our gross and net operating margins. Such changes in patterns are difficult to predict and may not be immediately apparent.\nIn addition to the cyclicality and seasonality of the semiconductor and ATE markets, demand for our products and our gross and net operating margins have also been affected by changes in the buying patterns of our customers. We believe that in recent years there have been a variety of changes within the ATE market, including, for example, changing product requirements, longer time periods between new product offerings by OEMs and changes in customer buying patterns. In particular, demand for our mechanical and electrical products, which are sold exclusively within the ATE market, and our operating margins in these product segments have been affected by shifts in the competitive landscape, including (i) customers placing heightened emphasis on shorter lead times (which places increased demands on our available engineering and production capacity increasing unit costs) and ordering in smaller quantities (which prevents us from acquiring component materials in larger volumes at lower cost and increasing unit costs), (ii) the increasing practice of OEM manufacturers to specify other suppliers as primary vendors, with less frequent opportunities to compete for such designations, (iii) customers requiring products with a greater range of use at the lowest cost, and (iv) customer supply chain management groups demanding lower prices and spreading purchases across multiple vendors.\n- 15 -\ninTEST CORPORATION\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThese shifts in market practices have had, and may continue to have, varying degrees of impact on our net revenues and our gross and net operating margins. Such shifts are difficult to predict and may not be immediately apparent, and the impact of these practices is difficult to quantify from period to period. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing effective strategies to counter these shifts.\nWe generate a large portion of our sales from a small number of customers. If we were to lose one or more of our large customers, operating results could suffer dramatically.\nTexas Instruments Incorporated accounted for 13% of our consolidated net revenues in both 2014 and 2013, respectively. While all three of our operating segments sold to this customer, these revenues were primarily generated by our Mechanical Products and Electrical Products segments. Hakuto Co. Ltd. accounted for 11% of our consolidated net revenues in 2014. These revenues were generated by our Thermal Products segment. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 48% and 47% of our net revenues in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The loss of any one or more of our largest customers, or a reduction in orders by a major customer, could materially reduce our net revenues or otherwise materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience significant variability in our effective tax rates and may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and costs.\nWe are subject to paying income taxes in the U.S. and various other countries in which we operate. Our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the U.S. and other countries. We are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate. Any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could negatively affect our financial results.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, and our business prospects would be negatively affected if we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to innovation in the semiconductor and ATE markets.\nSemiconductor technology continues to become more complex as manufacturers incorporate ICs into an increasing variety of products. This trend, and the changes needed in automatic testing systems to respond to developments in the semiconductor market, are likely to continue. We cannot be certain that we will be successful or timely in developing, manufacturing or selling products that will satisfy customer needs or that will attain market acceptance. Our failure to provide products that effectively and timely meet customer needs or gain market acceptance will negatively affect our business prospects.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of \"conflict\" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in our products. This new requirement could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products. In addition, there will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. As a result, we may be unable to certify that our products are conflict mineral free.\nA breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on various information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, including confidential data, and to carry out and support a variety of business activities, including manufacturing, research and development, supply chain management, sales and accounting. A failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our suppliers and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, damage our reputation, cause losses and increase our costs.\n- 16 -\ninTEST CORPORATION\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nIf our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements, we could have reduced revenues and earnings.\nCertain components may be in short supply from time to time because of high demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. A significant portion of our material purchases require some custom work and there are not always multiple suppliers capable of performing such custom work on a timely or cost effective basis. If any of our suppliers were to cancel commitments or fail to meet quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders, have reduced revenues and earnings, and be subject to contractual penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew statutory and regulatory requirements, tax increases and changes in government spending could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn recent years, the Federal government launched an aggressive statutory and regulatory agenda with the goal of enacting social and economic reforms. This agenda includes health care reform legislation and financial system regulatory reform, as well as proposed climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations. In addition, the Federal and many state and local governments are faced with budget crises that are causing these bodies to consider enacting significant tax increases, reducing or eliminating the use of net operating loss carryforwards and making significant budget cuts. It is uncertain how the applicable government agencies will enact the regulations necessary to carry out the statutory requirements. Accordingly, we cannot determine the costs and other effects of new legal requirements with certainty. For example, new legislation or regulations may cause us to experience increased costs as a direct result of our compliance efforts. At this point, we are unable to determine the impact that newly enacted federal healthcare legislation could have on our employer-sponsored medical plans. We may also indirectly experience increased costs to the extent such legal requirements increase the prices of goods and services that we purchase as a result of increased compliance costs to the vendors who provide these goods and services to us or the reduced availability of raw materials that we need to purchase. In addition, we cannot determine the impact that new legal requirements, tax increases or state and local government spending cuts will have on the business operations of our customers, where significant increases in operating costs due to the costs to comply with new legal requirements or tax increases may reduce their future product development and capital spending budgets. Our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected by these new legal requirements and government actions.\nOur business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. Our future success will depend largely upon the continued services of our senior management and other key employees or the development of successors with commensurate skills and talents. In the past, during periods of weakened demand which has caused us to experience operating losses, we have implemented temporary salary and benefit reductions and eliminations that have remained in place until our operations returned to profitability. As global economic conditions improve and employment opportunities increase, if we are unable to increase employee salaries and maintain employee benefits commensurate with competitive opportunities, we may not be able to retain our senior management and other key employees. Our business could suffer if we were to lose one of more of our senior officers or other key employees.\nIf we are not able to obtain patents on or otherwise preserve and protect our proprietary technologies, our business may suffer.\nWe have obtained domestic and foreign patents covering some of our products which expire between the years 2015 and 2033, and we have applications pending for additional patents. Some of our products utilize proprietary technology that is not covered by a patent or similar protection, and, in many cases, cannot be protected. We cannot be certain that:\nany additional patents will be issued on our applications;\nany patents we own now or in the future will protect our business against competitors that develop similar technology or products;\nour patents will be held valid if they are challenged or subjected to reexamination or reissue;\nothers will not claim rights to our patented or other proprietary technologies; or\n- 17 -\ninTEST CORPORATION\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nothers will not develop technologies which are similar to, or can compete with, our unpatented proprietary technologies.\nIf we cannot obtain patent or other protection for our proprietary technologies, our ability to compete in our markets could be impaired.\nClaims of intellectual property infringement by or against us could seriously harm our businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to defend or protect our rights or a customer's rights. These claims, regardless of merit, may consume valuable management time, result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays. Any of these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results. We may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties who claim infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if available, may be costly to us. If we are unable to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with satisfactory terms, our business could suffer. In instances where we have had reason to believe that we may be infringing the patent rights of others, or that someone may be infringing our patent rights, we have asked our patent counsel to evaluate the validity of the patents in question, as well as the potentially infringing conduct. If we become involved in a dispute, neither the third parties nor the courts are bound by our counsel's conclusions.\nA substantial portion of our customers are located outside the U.S., which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks.\nWe have operated internationally for many years and expect to expand our international operations as necessary to continue expansion of our sales and service to our non-U.S. customers. Our foreign subsidiaries generated 15% and 16% of consolidated net revenues in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net revenues from foreign customers totaled $27.4 million, or 66% of consolidated net revenues in 2014 and $26.1 million, or 66% of consolidated net revenues in 2013. We expect our net revenues from foreign customers will continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenues. However, in addition to the risks generally associated with sales and operations in the U.S., sales to customers outside the U.S. and operations in foreign countries are subject to additional risks, which may, in the future, affect our operations. These risks include:\npolitical and economic instability in foreign countries;\nthe imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments;\nthe need to comply with a wide variety of U.S. and foreign import and export laws;\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;\ntrade restrictions;\nchanges in tariffs and taxes;\nlonger payment cycles;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\nthe greater difficulty of administering business abroad.\nA significant portion of our cash position is maintained overseas.\nWhile much of our cash is in the U.S., a significant portion is generated from and maintained by our foreign operations. As of December 31, 2014, $3.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the U.S. to address our cash requirements or we are unable to efficiently and timely repatriate cash from overseas. Any payment of distributions, loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on, or taxation of, dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. If we are unable to repatriate the earnings of our subsidiaries it could have an adverse impact on our ability to redeploy earnings in other jurisdictions where they could be used more profitably.\n- 18 -\ninTEST CORPORATION\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014", "PERMNO": 85013, "SIC": 3825, "TIC": "INTT"}
