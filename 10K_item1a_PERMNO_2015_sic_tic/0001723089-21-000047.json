RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. Each of these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nTrends in crude oil and natural gas prices may affect the drilling and production activity, profitability and financial stability of our customers and therefore the demand for, and profitability of, our products and services.\nThe oil and gas industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns of varying length and severity. The industry experienced a significant downturn in 2015 and 2016 as a result of a sharp decline in crude oil prices, followed by a slight recovery in late 2016 and into 2017, and a volatile decline again in late 2018. Price volatility continued throughout 2019 and, partially due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and failure of OPEC and other major producers to agree on production cuts, became more extreme in 2020. Demand for our products and services is sensitive to the level of capital spending by global oil and natural gas companies and the corresponding drilling and production activity. The level of drilling and production activity is directly affected by trends in crude oil and natural gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas, including:\n\u2022worldwide economic activity, including potential disruption to global trade;\n\u2022the level of exploration and production activity;\n\u2022the industry cost of, and access to, capital;\n\u2022environmental regulation;\n\u2022domestic and global political and economic uncertainty, socio-political unrest and instability, terrorism or hostilities;\n\u2022U.S. federal, state and foreign government policies and regulations regarding current and future exploration and development of oil and gas;\n\u2022the ability and/or desire of OPEC and other major international producers to set and maintain production levels and influence pricing;\n\u2022the cost of exploring and producing oil and gas;\n\u2022the availability, expiration date and price of onshore and offshore leases;\n\u2022the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in onshore and offshore areas;\n\u2022the success of drilling for oil and gas in unconventional resource plays such as shale formations;\n\u2022the depletion rate of existing oil and gas wells in productions;\n\u2022takeaway capacity within oil and gas producing basins;\n\u2022alternative investments in onshore exploration and production opportunities;\n\u2022shifts in business and personal travel with increased adoption of remote work arrangements;\n\u2022the COVID-19 pandemic or other health pandemics and epidemics;\n\u2022exceptional weather conditions, including severe weather events in the U.S. Gulf Coast; and\n\u2022the pace of adoption and cost of developing alternative energy sources.\nWe expect continued volatility in both crude oil and natural gas prices (including the possibilities that such prices could remain at current levels or decline further for an extended period of time), as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, decisions of OPEC and other oil exporting nations regarding production, and the other factors listed above. Our ability to modify and adopt our operating activities in response to lower oilfield service activity levels during periodic industry downturns or in the transition to a lower carbon economy is important to our business, results of operations and prospects. However, a significant further decline and/or extended continuation of the recent downturn in the industry could continue to impact demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could result in asset impairments, including an impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill, along with other accounting charges.\nWe might be unable to successfully compete with other companies in our industry.\nThe business in which we operate is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors are customer service, product quality and performance, price, breadth of product offering, local content and geographic footprint, technical expertise and innovation. In some of our product and service offerings, we compete with the oil and gas industry\u2019s largest oilfield service providers. These large national and multi-national companies may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, and a stronger presence in geographies than us. They may also have more robust organizational and technical capabilities. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable of effectively competing on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and for changes in customer requirements. Many\ncontracts are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. As a result of the competitive environment in which we operate, we may lose competitive share, be unable to maintain or increase prices for our products and services, or be unable to develop new business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to develop new products and technologies, our competitive position may be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our sales and market share.\nThe businesses in which we operate are characterized by changing technologies and the introduction of new products and services. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new products and services on a cost-effective basis, to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner, and to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and technologies, or failure to gain customer acceptance of new products and technologies, may significantly reduce future revenue and materially and adversely affect our competitive position. While we intend to continue to commit financial resources and effort to the development of new products and services, our ability to do so may be impacted by the prolonged industry downturn and/or we may not be able to successfully differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors. Our customers may not consider our proposed products and services to be of value to them or may not view them as superior to our competitors\u2019 products and services. In addition, our competitors or customers may develop new technologies which are similar to, or improvements on, our existing technologies.\nFurther, we may not be able to adapt to evolving customer needs and technologies, including the transition to a lower-carbon economy and energy system by our customers, develop new products, and achieve and maintain technological advantages in developing products and services in support of the evolving industry. If we do not successfully compete through the development and introduction of new products and technologies, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials or if we are unable to obtain raw materials.\nWe purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in manufacturing operations, which exposes us to volatility in prices for certain commodities. Significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect our operating profits. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by endeavoring to make strategic purchasing decisions, broadening our supplier base and passing along increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of our products. Additionally, we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to the terms of existing contracts, a competitor\u2019s pricing pressure or other factors. The inability to obtain necessary raw materials on acceptable terms could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy demand for certain products. Certain of our product lines depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers and vendors. The ability of these third parties to deliver raw materials may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, public health threats, such as COVID-19, severe influenza and other highly communicable viruses or diseases could limit access to vendors and their facilities, or the ability to transport raw materials from our vendors, which would adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary raw materials for certain of our products or increase the costs of such materials. A significant price increase in, raw materials of, tariffs imposed on, or unavailability of, may result in a loss of customers and/or adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could result in asset impairments, including an impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill.\nOur growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to complete third party acquisitions on acceptable terms and integrate such acquisitions.\nOver time, it is expected that we will acquire value creating, bolt-on capabilities that broaden our existing technological, geographic and cost position, thereby complementing our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to find suitable opportunities to purchase or acquire such capabilities on acceptable terms. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts, our revenue growth could be adversely affected. In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities, or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our then current business and growth model. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur products are used in operations that are subject to potential hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry and, as a result, we are exposed to potential liabilities that may affect our financial condition and reputation.\nOur products are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion and production applications in the oil and gas industry where an accident or a failure of a product can potentially have catastrophic consequences. Risks inherent in these applications, such as equipment malfunctions and defects, failures, equipment misuse, explosions, blowouts and uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids can cause personal injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, damage to formations, damage to facilities, business interruption and damage to or destruction of property, surface and drinking water resources, equipment and the environment. While we currently maintain insurance protection against some of these risks and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring them to hold us harmless from some of these risks, our current insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective enough to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA chemical spill or release could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products, there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled, released or discharged, either in liquid or gaseous form, during production, transportation, storage or use. Such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard, and result in significant remediation costs for us and potential disruption for, and damage to, our manufacturing facilities, customers, communities, and other stakeholders. Accordingly, such a release could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur industry is undergoing continuing consolidation that may impact our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry continues to experience business consolidations and as a result, some of our largest customers have combined and are using their size and purchasing power to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions. This consolidation may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers or the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers, which may lead to decreased demand for our products and services. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our level of sales to a customer that has consolidated, or replace that revenue with increased business activity with other customers. As a result, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers may have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are unable to predict what effect consolidations in the industry may have on prices, capital spending by our customers, our selling strategies, our competitive position, our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers.\nThe credit risks of our customer base could result in losses.\nThe majority of our customers are oil and gas companies that have faced or may in the future face liquidity constraints during adverse commodity price environments. These customers are also affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the current downturn in the oil and gas industry as a result of the lower crude oil and nature gas price environment. If a significant number of our customers experience prolonged business declines, disruptions, or bankruptcies, we may incur increased exposure to credit risk and losses from bad debts.\nThe loss of one or more significant customers could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur customers represent a combination of some of the largest operators in the oil and gas drilling and production markets, including major integrated, large, medium and small independents, and foreign national oil and gas companies, as well as oilfield equipment and service providers. While no single customer accounted for net sales equal to 10 percent or more of total revenues for the previous four years, and we are not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of our significant customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to information technology, cybersecurity and privacy risks.\nWe depend on various information technologies and other products and services to store and process business information and otherwise support our business activities. We also manufacture and sell hardware and software to provide monitoring, controls and optimization of customer critical assets in oil and gas production and distribution. In addition, certain of our customer offerings include digital components, such as remote monitoring of certain customer operations. We also provide services to maintain these systems. Additionally, our operations rely upon partners, suppliers and other third-party providers of information\ntechnology and other products and services. If any of these information technologies, products or services are damaged, cease to properly function, are breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, we and our partners, suppliers or other third parties could experience: (i) production downtimes, (ii) operational delays, (iii) the compromising of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal and customer data, (iv) destruction, corruption, or theft of data, (v) security breaches, (vi) other manipulation, disruption, misappropriation or improper use of our systems or networks, (vii) hydrocarbon pollution from loss of containment, (viii) financial losses from remedial actions, (ix) loss of business or potential liability, (x) adverse media coverage, and (xi) legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, and/or damage to our reputation. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems, the Company\u2019s and our customers\u2019, partners\u2019, vendors\u2019 and other third- parties\u2019 systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks relating to existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.\nWe continue to focus on expanding sales globally as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant and growing portion of our revenue. Our international operations and global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:\n\u2022political, social and economic instability and disruptions;\n\u2022export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;\n\u2022the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022limitations on ownership and on repatriation or dividend of earnings;\n\u2022transportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022access to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks; and\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy into new geographical markets, our reputation, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDependence on joint ventures and other local partners could adversely affect our profits.\nWe conduct some operations through joint ventures in which unaffiliated third parties may control or have significant influence on the operations of the joint venture. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in the joint venture operating in a manner that is contrary to our preference, delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.\nIn addition to joint ventures, we rely on local third-party partners in a number of foreign jurisdictions to provide various services in support of our product sales, including sales and distribution, installation, field service, technical support, and the provision of equipment and personnel. If a local partner is unwilling or unable to deliver its services for any reason including, but not limited to, a dispute with us, the deterioration of its financial condition or a loss of personnel, we may be unable to engage an alternative partner or subcontractors to perform the same services, or on terms substantially similar to those with our existing partners. The failure to do so may cause us to breach the terms of existing contracts, impede our ability to complete orders, and/or result in damage to our customer relationships in that jurisdiction, any of which may damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business in the impacted jurisdiction.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business, and depending on the duration of the pandemic and its effect on the oil and gas industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction in demand for oil and gas commodities as various jurisdictions have attempted to implement or have implemented measures designed to contain the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns of non-essential business. Oil demand has significantly deteriorated as a result of the virus outbreak and corresponding preventative measures taken around the world to mitigate the spread of the virus. Due to the uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, production cuts may not be sufficient to support and stabilize commodity prices, and there is no assurance that any production cuts will be extended.\nWhile the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet known, potential risks associated with the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022disruptions to our supply chain resulting from our limited access to our vendors, our vendors\u2019 limited access to their facilities or our ability to transport raw materials from our vendors, adversely affecting the price of, or our ability to obtain, materials essential to our products and our business which could result in a loss of customers and revenue;\n\u2022reduction in revenues as a result of lower demand for our products as upstream oil and gas companies across the industry reduce their drilling activities, lower budgeted capital expenditures and institute additional capital discipline measures;\n\u2022liquidity challenges, including impacts related to delayed customer payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues and bankruptcies, and, if a significant number of our customers experience a prolonged business decline or disruption, we may incur increased exposure to credit risk and bad debts;\n\u2022a credit rating downgrade of our corporate debt if COVID-19 and the current oil market have a significant impact on our long-term profitability, which could result in higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of sources of financing;\n\u2022workforce availability resulting from reductions to adjust to market conditions or due to restrictions that we and our customers impose, including limiting worksite access and facility shutdowns, to ensure the safety of employees and others, which could adversely affect our ability to timely fulfill customer orders and service requests;\n\u2022costs associated with the rationalization of our portfolio of real estate facilities, including possible exit of leases and facility closures to align with expected activity and workforce capacity;\n\u2022additional asset impairments, including an impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill, along with other accounting charges as demand for our services and products decreases;\n\u2022continuation of measures taken by various governments to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns, as well as increased acceptance of remote work arrangements and decreased levels of personal travel; and\n\u2022compliance with financial covenants in the terms of our debt instruments if we experience a significant and prolonged decrease in our earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization which would cause amounts borrowed to become due and payable.\nFailure to attract, retain and develop personnel for key management could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur growth, profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel, and align them with appropriate opportunities for key management positions. Additionally, during periods of increased investment in the oil and gas industry, competition for qualified personnel may increase and the availability of qualified personnel may be challenged. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, market share and competitive position could be adversely affected. Additionally, we could miss opportunities for growth and business efficiencies.\nThe inability to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights could adversely affect our revenue, operating profits and cash flows.\nWe own patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property related to our products and services, and we continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and intellectual property rights. We employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect our innovations and intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent our intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are\nnot highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights and any potential litigation we may initiate or have initiated against us in respect of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNatural disasters and unusual weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters or severe weather conditions. Hurricanes, tropical storms, flash floods, blizzards, cold weather and other natural disasters or severe weather conditions could result in evacuation of personnel, curtailment of services, damage to equipment and facilities, interruption in transportation of products and materials and loss of productivity. For example, certain of our manufactured products and components are manufactured at a single facility, and disruptions in operations or damage to any such facilities could reduce our ability to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand. If our customers are unable to operate or are required to reduce operations due to natural disasters or severe weather conditions, our business could be adversely affected as a result of curtailed deliveries of our products and services. Our headquarters and certain manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S. Gulf Coast and this region is also home to many of our customers and suppliers. Hurricanes or other severe weather events impacting the Gulf Coast could materially and adversely affect our operations, our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable cost, or at all, and our customers in the region.\nRisks Related to Financial Condition and Markets\nRestrictions imposed by our debt instruments may limit the ability of our subsidiaries to operate their business and to finance their future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nThe terms of our debt instruments restrict certain of our subsidiaries from engaging in specified types of transactions. These covenants restrict the ability of the Company and our restricted subsidiaries, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or indebtedness, as applicable;\n\u2022make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;\n\u2022engage in transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; and\n\u2022consolidate or merge.\nIn addition, the debt instruments contain certain financial maintenance covenants. Our ability to comply with these restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to maintain compliance with them. A breach of any of these covenants would be an event of default.\nIn the event of a default under any of the debt instruments, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such debt instruments to be immediately due and payable, or in the case of our revolving credit facility, may terminate their commitments to lend additional money. If the indebtedness under any of our debt instruments were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. In addition, our senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 assets. If an event of default occurs under our debt instruments, the lenders could exercise their rights under the related security documents, and an event of default may be triggered under other debt instruments. Any acceleration of amounts due under our debt instruments or the substantial exercise by the lenders of their rights under the security documents would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operating flexibility.\nOur ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness, as well as any future indebtedness that we may incur, will depend upon the level of cash flows generated by our operations, our ability to sell assets, availability under our revolving credit facility and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, industry, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are not able to repay or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (i) reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes or (ii) dedicating an unsustainable level of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on the indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the oil and gas industry could be impaired.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, low commodity prices, our debt level and other factors may restrict our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Continued low commodity prices, among other factors, have caused some lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards which we may not satisfy as a result of our debt level or otherwise, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity on favorable terms, or at all, and in certain instances have reduced or ceased to provide funding to borrowers. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms or at all, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.\nA portion of our business is transacted and/or denominated in foreign currencies, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the inability to exchange or repatriate foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Although the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has historically not been material, significant changes in currency exchange rates, could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, a future strengthening of the U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries and could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nWe may not realize the anticipated cost synergies and growth opportunities from the Merger.\nWe expect to realize cost synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the Merger. Our success in realizing these benefits, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the business operations of legacy ChampionX with the Company. Even if we are able to integrate legacy ChampionX successfully, we cannot predict with certainty if or when these cost synergies, growth opportunities and benefits will occur, or the extent to which they will actually be achieved. For example, the benefits from the Merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies. Realization of any benefits and synergies could be affected by the factors described in other risk factors and a number of factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, further consolidation in the industry in which we operate, increased operating costs and regulatory developments.\nThe integration of legacy ChampionX following the Merger may present significant challenges.\nThere is a significant degree of difficulty inherent in the process of integrating legacy ChampionX with the Company. These difficulties include:\n\u2022the integration of legacy ChampionX with our current businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of all businesses;\n\u2022managing a significantly larger company than before the consummation of the Merger;\n\u2022coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022integrating the business cultures of each of legacy ChampionX and the Company, which may prove to be incompatible;\n\u2022creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters;\n\u2022ability to ensure the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022integrating certain information technology, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing, human resources, payroll and regulatory compliance systems; and\n\u2022the potential difficulty in retaining key officers and personnel.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the Company\u2019s activities. Members of senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage business operations, serve the business, or develop new products or strategies. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nThe successful or cost-effective integration of legacy ChampionX cannot be assured. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement limits our ability to engage in certain activities competitive with Ecolab.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement includes non-compete provisions pursuant to which the legacy ChampionX business is restricted from competing in the water and downstream fields of use for three years following the Distribution subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. In addition, Ecolab may have the ability to terminate certain rights, including patent licenses, if legacy ChampionX businesses begin to compete in the downstream or water fields of use even after the expiration of the non-compete period. These restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain activities, may potentially lead to disputes and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Distribution could result in significant tax liability, and we may be obligated to indemnify Ecolab for any such tax liability imposed on Ecolab.\nPrior to the Distribution, Ecolab received an opinion of its counsel (the \u201cDistribution Tax Opinion\u201d), substantially to the effect that the contribution of Ecolab\u2019s upstream energy business to legacy ChampionX (the \u201cContribution\u201d) and the Distribution, taken together, will qualify as a transaction described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), and an opinion from KPMG LLP (\u201cKPMG\u201d), that addressed the tax treatment of certain aspects of the Contribution, Distribution and the Merger (the \u201cKPMG Tax Opinion\u201d). Except for taxable income or gain possibly arising as a result of certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken in its separation of the upstream energy business (the \u201cChampionX Separation\u201d), and with respect to any \u201cintercompany transaction\u201d required to be taken into account by Ecolab under the Treasury Regulations related to consolidated federal income tax returns, Ecolab will not recognize any gain or loss. None of Ecolab, legacy ChampionX or the Company has requested or intends to request any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Contribution, the ChampionX Separation, the Distribution or the Merger. Neither the Distribution Tax Opinion nor the KPMG Tax Opinion are binding on the IRS (or any applicable foreign taxing authorities) or the courts, and the IRS (or any applicable foreign taxing authorities) or the courts may not agree with the conclusions reached therein. There can be no assurance that the IRS (or any applicable foreign taxing authorities) will not successfully assert that the Distribution, or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken in the Separation, are taxable transactions, and that a court will not sustain such assertion, which could result in tax being incurred by Ecolab.\nIf the Contribution and Distribution, taken together, were determined not to qualify as a transaction described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Ecolab would generally recognize gain with respect to the transfer of ChampionX common stock in the Distribution if the value of ChampionX stock transferred exceeds Ecolab\u2019s tax basis in such ChampionX stock.\nEven if the Contribution and Distribution, taken together, otherwise qualify as a transaction described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, the Distribution will nonetheless be taxable to Ecolab pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire a 50% or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of Ecolab or legacy ChampionX, directly or indirectly (including through acquisitions of the stock of the Company after the Merger), as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution. For purposes of this test, the Merger will be treated as part of a plan that includes the Distribution, but it is expected that the Merger, standing alone, will not cause the Distribution to be taxable to Ecolab under Section 355(e) of the Code because holders of legacy ChampionX common stock own more than 50% of the common stock of the Company following the Merger. However, if the IRS were to determine that other acquisitions of Ecolab stock, either before or after the Distribution, or the Company\u2019s stock after the Merger, are part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution, such determination could result in the recognition of gain by Ecolab for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the amount of taxes on such gain could be substantial.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, we may be obligated, in certain cases, to indemnify Ecolab against taxes and certain tax-related losses of the Contribution, Separation, Distribution or Merger (collectively, the \u201cTransactions\u201d) that arise as a result of our actions, or failure to act. Any such indemnification obligation would likely be substantial and would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions that could adversely affect the intended tax treatment of the Transactions, and such restrictions could significantly impair our ability to implement strategic initiatives that otherwise would be beneficial.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement generally restricts us from taking certain actions after the Distribution that could adversely affect the intended tax treatment of the Transactions. Failure to adhere to these restrictions could result in tax being imposed on Ecolab for which we could bear responsibility and for which we could be obligated to indemnify Ecolab. Any such indemnification obligation would likely be substantial and would likely have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, even if we are not responsible for tax liabilities of Ecolab under the Tax Matters Agreement, legacy ChampionX nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if Ecolab were to fail to pay such taxes. Because of these provisions in the Tax Matters Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions, particularly for the two (or, in certain cases three) years following the Merger, including (among other things) the ability to freely issue stock, to make acquisitions and to raise additional equity capital. These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition, and otherwise could impair our ability to implement strategic initiatives. Also, our indemnity obligation to Ecolab might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our shareholders may consider favorable.\nThe legacy ChampionX business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to provide benefits and services, or access to equivalent financial strength and resources, to legacy ChampionX that historically have been provided by Ecolab.\nThe legacy ChampionX business has historically received benefits and services from Ecolab and has benefited from Ecolab\u2019s financial strength and corporate support services. After the Transactions, legacy ChampionX as a subsidiary of the Company, no longer benefits from Ecolab\u2019s services, financial strength or business relationships to the extent not otherwise addressed in the other transaction documents contemplated by the Separation and Distribution Agreement, referred to as the Transaction Documents. While Ecolab has agreed to provide certain transition services to legacy ChampionX for a period of time following the consummation of the Transactions, it cannot be assured that we will be able to adequately replace or provide resources formerly provided by Ecolab or replace them at the same or lower cost. If we are not able to replace the resources provided by Ecolab or are unable to replace them without incurring significant additional costs, or are delayed in replacing the resources provided by Ecolab, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWar, terrorism or civil unrest could harm our business.\nDue to the unsettled political conditions in many natural gas and oil-producing countries, our operations, revenue and profits are subject to adverse consequences of war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes, currency controls, and governmental actions. These risks could result in the loss of our personnel or assets, cause us to evacuate our personnel from certain countries, cause us to increase spending on security worldwide, cause us to cease operating in certain countries, disrupt financial and commercial markets, including the supply of and pricing for oil and natural gas, and generate political and economic instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. Areas where we operate that have significant risks include, but are not limited to, the Middle East, North Africa, West Africa, the Caspian Sea region, Southeast Asia and Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Venezuela and other countries in South America. In addition, any possible reprisals as a consequence of military or other action, such as acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to oil and gas development and the potential for related litigation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for our customers, which could reduce demand for our products.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could limit our customers\u2019 exploration and production activities. Although we do not directly engage in drilling or hydraulic fracturing activities, we provide products and services to operators in the oil and gas industry. There has been significant growth in opposition to oil and gas development both in the United States and globally. This opposition is focused on attempting to limit or stop hydrocarbon development in certain areas. Examples of such opposition include: (i) efforts to reduce access to public and private lands, (ii) delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction, (iii) limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, and/or adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal, (iv) delaying or denying air-quality permits, and (v) advocating for increased regulations, punitive taxation, or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity.\nIn addition, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of oil and gas development through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, including on the time, place and\nmanner of drilling activities, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing or other facets of crude oil and natural gas exploration and development in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. Increased regulation and opposition to oil and gas activities could increase the potential for litigation concerning these activities, and could include companies who provide products and services used in hydrocarbon development, such as us.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state, or local levels imposing reporting obligations, or otherwise limiting or delaying hydrocarbon development, could make it more difficult for our customers to complete oil and gas wells, increase our customers\u2019 costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the oil and gas activities they pursue. Such developments could negatively impact demand for our products and services. In addition, heightened political, regulatory and public scrutiny, including lawsuits, could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly, or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance or the risks of liability limit the ability or willingness of our customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our products and services, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous and complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health, safety and the environment. These laws and regulations may adversely affect us by limiting or curtailing our customers\u2019 exploration, drilling and production activities, impacting the products and services we design, market and sell and the facilities where we manufacture our products. For example, our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous and complex laws and regulations that, among other things: may regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes; may require acquisition of environmental permits related to our operations; may restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment; may limit or prohibit operational activities in certain ecologically sensitive and other protected areas; may regulate specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; may require compliance with operational and equipment standards; may impose testing, reporting and record-keeping requirements; and may require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations. Sanctions for noncompliance with such laws and regulations may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties, criminal prosecution and the imposition of injunctions to prohibit certain activities or force future compliance.\nSome environmental laws and regulations provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, we or our customers may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. These laws and regulations may expose us or our customers to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts or for the acts of our customers that were in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at the time such acts were performed. Any of these laws and regulations could result in claims, fines or expenditures that could be material to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. New laws, regulations treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, may have a material adverse effect on our customers by limiting or curtailing their exploration, drilling, and production activities, which may adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and services. Additionally, the implementation of new laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify our operations or products or shut down some or all of our facilities.\nVarious laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d), including establishing GHG \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs, increased efficiency standards, participation in international climate agreements, issuance of executive orders by the U.S. presidential administration and incentives or mandates for pollution reduction, use of renewable energy sources, or use of alternative fuels with lower carbon content. Any regulation of GHG emissions could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions for us and/or our customers and limit or curtail exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers, which could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our products and services, adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by violations of U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding, anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions, anti-corruption and similar laws.\nOur operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those relating to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, fair competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, our international operations are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate. While we strive to maintain high ethical standards and robust internal controls, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate such U.S. or international laws or regulations. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States or other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nTariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn 2020, the U.S. government continued to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum and a broad range of other products imported into the United States. In response to the tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, a number of jurisdictions, including the European Union, Canada, Mexico, India and China announced tariffs on U.S. goods and services. These tariffs have increased our material input costs, and any further trade restrictions, retaliatory trade measures and additional tariffs could result in higher input costs for our products. We may not be able to fully mitigate the impact of these increased costs or pass price increases on to our customers. While tariffs and other retaliatory trade measures imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact on our business or results of operations, we cannot predict further developments, and such existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges in domestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations and policies, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and laws, and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits could adversely affect our business, profitability and reputation.\nOur domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations and policies (including environmental and employment regulations, export/import laws, local content and local ownership requirements, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations and other similar programs). Failure to comply with any of the foregoing laws, regulations and policies could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, as well as damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, data security, data privacy and health and safety laws, will not exceed our estimates. In addition, we have made investments in certain countries, and we may in the future invest in other countries, which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation.\nWe are subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions. Accordingly, our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. A material change in the statutory tax rate or interpretation of local law in a jurisdiction in which we have significant operations could adversely impact our effective tax rate and impact our financial results. For example, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d), enacted in December 2017, significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and imposing limitations on the ability to deduct interest expense.\nOur tax returns are subject to audit and taxing authorities could challenge our operating structure, taxable presence, application of treaty benefits or transfer pricing policies. If changes in statutory tax rates or laws or audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in tax laws could have an adverse effect on our customers, resulting in lower demand for our products and services.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of COREXIT\u2122 dispersant in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs.\nAs described in Note 9-Commitments And Contingencies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, certain of our subsidiaries (collectively the \u201cCOREXIT Defendants\u201d) are among the defendants in a number of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from the use of COREXIT\u2122 dispersant in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which could expose the Company to monetary damages or settlement costs. The plaintiffs in these matters have claimed damages under products liability, tort and other theories.\nWhile three cases remain pending against the COREXIT Defendants and are expected to be dismissed pursuant to a November 28, 2012 order granting the COREXIT Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, we cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal, the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation. Although we believe we have rights to contribution and/or indemnification from third parties in connection with these lawsuits, if an appeal by plaintiffs in these lawsuits is brought and won, these suits could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe COREXIT Defendants continue to sell the COREXIT\u2122 oil dispersant product and previously sold product remains in the inventories of individual customers and oil spill response organizations. We cannot predict the potential for future litigation with respect to such sales or inventory. However, if one or more of such lawsuits are brought and won, these suits could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.", "PERMNO": 17783, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "CHX"}
