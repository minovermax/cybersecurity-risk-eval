The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may ultimately materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCommodity pricing can fluctuate widely and strongly affects our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and ability to grow.\nOur financial results, financial condition, cash flow and rate of growth correlate closely to the prices we obtain for our products. Recently, global energy commodity prices have declined significantly. For example, Brent crude prices have declined from over $115 per barrel in June 2014 to below $47 per barrel in January 2015. In a declining price environment we may incur costs to terminate drilling rig contracts, and may be required to write-down property values, such as we did in recent months. Product prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in consumption patterns, global and local (particularly for natural gas) economic conditions, the actions of OPEC and other oil and natural gas producing countries, inventory levels, actual or threatened production disruptions, currency exchange rates, worldwide drilling and exploration activities, the effects of conservation, weather, geophysical and technical limitations, refining and processing disruptions, transportation bottlenecks and other matters affecting the supply and demand dynamics of oil, natural gas and NGLs, and the effect of changes in market perceptions. These and other factors make it impossible to predict realized prices reliably. In addition, any significant increase in transportation infrastructure that increases the importation of crude oil to California from other parts of the country could negatively impact the price we receive for our crude oil.\nAny sustained periods of low prices for oil and natural gas may materially and adversely affect our financial position, the quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that we can economically produce, our cash flow available for capital investments and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit facility and through the capital markets.\nWe have significant indebtedness and may incur more debt. Higher levels of indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $6.36 billion of consolidated indebtedness, comprising $5.0 billion of senior notes, $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility and $360 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we had the ability to incur $1.64 billion of additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which has effectively been reduced under the first amendment to our credit facilities discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\". As of December 31, 2014, we had letters of credit in an aggregate amount of approximately $25 million that were issued to support ordinary course marketing, regulatory and other matters. In addition, the indenture relating to the notes and the credit facilities (as defined in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit Facilities\u201d) permits us to incur certain defined obligations, unrestricted by debt incurrence or lien covenants, or that do not constitute indebtedness (as defined in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit Facilities\u201d).\nIndebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate, therefore a rise in interest rates will generate greater interest expense if and to the extent we do not purchase interest rate hedges.\nOur level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in our business and to general economic and industry conditions, and putting us at a disadvantage against other competitors that have lower fixed obligations and more cash flow to devote to their businesses;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital investments, general corporate and other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in operating our business and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or sell additional equity on terms that may be unattractive if it may be done at all. Further, our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default under that indebtedness. Any of these factors could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to satisfy our obligations under the notes.\nOur business requires substantial capital investments. We may be unable to fund these investments through operating cash flow or obtain any needed additional capital on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and gas reserves or production. Our capital investment program is also susceptible to risks that could materially affect its implementation.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital investments for the development and exploration of oil and gas reserves. We have developed a multi-year capital investment program to execute our strategy. We invested approximately $2.1 billion of capital on development and exploration activities during the year ended December 31, 2014, funded by our operating cash flow of $2.4 billion. Under our 2015 capital budget, we plan to invest approximately $420 million for development and exploration activities.\nOur ability to deploy capital as planned depends on a number of variables, including: (i) commodity prices and sales point disruptions; (ii) regulatory and third-party approvals; (iii) our ability to timely drill wells due to technical factors and contract terms; (iv) the availability of capital, equipment, services and personnel; and (v) drilling and completion costs and results. Because of these and other potential variables, we may be unable to deploy capital in the manner planned and actual development activities may materially differ from those presently anticipated.\nWe intend to finance our future capital investments, other than any significant acquisitions, primarily through cash flow from operations and, if necessary, through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or the issuance of debt or equity securities. We may not generate sufficient cash flow to fund our growth plans or to generate acceptable returns. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if there is not market demand or if our lenders refuse to exercise their discretion to expand our existing credit. In the event additional capital is needed and unavailable, we may curtail drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell assets on an unfavorable basis.\nOur business is highly regulated and governmental authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change legal requirements governing our operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation, enhanced production techniques and fluid disposal, that could increase costs, restrict operations and delay our implementation of, or cause us to change, our business strategy.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to the exploration and development of our properties, the production, transportation and sale of our products, and the services we provide. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\u201d for a description of the laws and regulations that affect our business. To operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state and local governmental authorities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal fines and penalties and liability for non-compliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or limiting our operations. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict or joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of contamination, including on properties over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nCosts of compliance may increase or operational delays or restrictions may occur as existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or as new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Certain government agencies have adopted or proposed new or more stringent requirements for permitting, well construction, public disclosure or environmental review of, or restrictions on, certain oil and gas operations, including drilling, well stimulation, enhanced production techniques or fluid disposal. Such new requirements or restrictions or resulting litigation could result in potentially significant added costs to comply, delay or curtail our exploration, development, or production activities, and preclude us from drilling or stimulating wells, which could impair our expected production growth over the longer term. For example, in 2013, California adopted SB 4, which mandated further regulation of certain well stimulation techniques, including hydraulic fracturing.\nThe implementation of interim well stimulation regulations under SB 4 in 2014 delayed certain operations, and California's implementation of final SB 4 regulations and associated studies and reports may increase costs and cause additional delays. In addition, certain local governments have proposed or adopted ordinances that purport, within their jurisdictions, to regulate certain drilling activities in general, or well stimulation or completion activities in particular, including hydraulic fracturing, or to ban such activities outright.\nPart of our strategy involves exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. Our drilling results are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline if drilling is unsuccessful.\nExploration is inherently risky and its results are unpredictable. The results of our exploratory drilling in new or emerging plays are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and have established production, and we may increase the proportion of our drilling in new or emerging plays over time. We may not find commercial amounts of oil or natural gas, in which case the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and could be impaired.\nOne of our important assets is our acreage in the Monterey shale play in the San Joaquin, Los Angeles and Ventura basins. The geology of the Monterey shale is highly complex and not uniform due to localized and varied faulting and changes in structure and rock characteristics. As a result, it differs from other shale plays that can be developed in part on the basis of their uniformity. Instead, individual Monterey shale drilling sites may need to be more fully understood and may require a more precise development approach, which could affect our ability, the timing or the cost to develop this asset.\nTax law changes may adversely affect our operations.\nIn California, there have been proposals for tax increases for the past several years including a severance tax as high as 12.5% on oil, natural gas and NGLs production in California. Although the proposals have not become law, well-funded campaigns by various interest groups could lead to future oil and gas severance taxes. The imposition of such a tax could severely reduce our profit margins and cash flow and could ultimately result in lower oil and natural gas production, which may reduce our capital investments and growth plans.\nIn addition, President Obama\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2016 recommended the elimination of certain federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies all of which could harm us. These changes include (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of expensing intangible drilling costs, (iii) an increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geophysical costs paid or incurred by independent producers in connection with the exploration for, or development of, oil or natural gas and (iv) repeal of the ability to claim the domestic manufacturing deduction against income derived from the sale or exchange of oil, natural gas or primary products produced in the United States.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our decisions to explore, develop, purchase or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of geophysical, geologic, engineering, production and other technical data, the analysis of which is often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is also often uncertain. Overruns in budgeted investments are a common risk that can make a particular project uneconomical or less economical than forecast. We bear the risks of equipment failures, accidents, environmental hazards, adverse weather conditions, permitting or construction delays, title disputes, surface access disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance, including response to IOR or EOR efforts, and other associated risks.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for oilfield equipment, services, qualified personnel and acquisitions.\nWe compete for services to profitably develop our assets, to find or acquire additional reserves and to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have many competitors, some of which: (i) are larger and better funded; (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies. Historically, there have been periodic shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe and other oilfield equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. The demand for qualified and experienced geologists, geophysicists and engineers, and for field and other personnel to drill wells, conduct field operations and construct and maintain facilities, can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages which may increase costs for such services. Finally, competition for reserves can make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts.\nEstimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nMany uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and related future net cash flows. Our estimates are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\nThe reserves information included in this report represents estimates prepared by internal engineers. The procedures and methods used to estimate our reserves by these internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, no audit of estimated reserve volumes was conducted by these consultants. Reserves estimation is a partially subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, including:\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from similar areas;\n\u2022\nthe quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices;\n\u2022\nproduction and operating costs;\n\u2022\nad valorem, excise and income taxes;\n\u2022\ndevelopment costs;\n\u2022\nthe effects of government regulations; and\n\u2022\nfuture workover and remedial costs.\nMisunderstanding of the variables, inaccurate assumptions, changed circumstances or new information could require us to make significant negative reserve revisions.\nWe currently expect improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to be our main sources for reserve additions, but factors such as geology, government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans are partially or fully outside management\u2019s control and could cause unforeseen results.\nOur producing properties are located exclusively in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nOur operations are geographically concentrated exclusively in California. Because of this geographic concentration, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of regional events. These include, among others, fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in the region, changes in state or regional laws and regulations affecting our operations, and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and rail transportation capacity constraints, available rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies, labor and infrastructure capacity. The concentration of our operations in California also increases exposure to unexpected events that may occur in this region such as natural disasters, industrial accidents or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development of lease inventory before expiration. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRestrictions on our ability to obtain, use, manage or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWater is an essential component of our operations. Approximately 90% of the fluids we produce are brackish waters, unsuitable for agricultural use, that need to be managed, recycled or disposed. We treat and re-use this water for a substantial portion of our needs related to activities such as steamflooding, waterflooding, pressure management, well completion and stimulation, including hydraulic fracturing, and we provide water for agricultural use in certain areas. We also use supplied water from various local and regional sources. Some of our fields are more dependent on supplied water to support operations like steam injection. Due to severe drought in California, some local and regional water districts and the state government are implementing policies or regulations that restrict water usage and increase the cost of water.\nExisting regulations restrict our ability and increase our cost to manage and dispose of wastewater. The federal Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act and similar state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of produced waters and waste and the subsurface injection of fluids. We must obtain permits or waivers for certain discharges and for construction activities that may affect regulated water resources. In addition, certain government agencies have investigated and continue to study whether fluid injection can induce ground movement or seismicity. Our enhanced production operations or fluid disposal could give rise to litigation over claims related to alleged damage to the environment or private or public property. The laws, regulations, policies and attendant liabilities relating to water use, wastewater disposal and fluid injection could increase our costs and negatively affect our development and production activities.\nOur Area of Mutual Interest (\"AMI\") Agreement may limit our ability to operate outside of California.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we entered into an AMI Agreement, which provides Occidental with the right to acquire a 51% interest in, and rights with respect to, certain oil and gas properties we acquire in the United States, other than in the State of California, for five years following the completion of the Spin-off. If we were to change our current strategy of focusing exclusively on opportunities in California, the AMI Agreement could adversely affect our ability to pursue opportunities outside of California during the five years following the Spin-off.\nWe may not drill our identified sites at the times we scheduled or at all and sites we decide to drill may not yield crude oil or natural gas in economically producible quantities.\nWe have specifically identified locations for scheduled drilling over the next several years. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our long-term growth strategy. Our ability to profitably drill and develop these locations depends on a number of variables, including crude oil and natural gas prices, the availability of capital, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity and other factors. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. We view the risk profile for our exploration drilling locations and our prospective resource drilling locations as being higher than for our other drilling locations due to relatively less available geologic and production data and drilling history, in particular with respect to our prospective resource locations, which are in unproven geologic plays. We make assumptions about the consistency and accuracy of data when we identify these locations that may prove inaccurate. We cannot guarantee that these prospective drilling locations or any other drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, some of our leases could expire if we do not establish production in the leased acreage. The combined net acreage covered by leases expiring in the next three years represents 23% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2014. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation, and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity-price, interest-rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd-Frank Act\"), enacted in 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented, and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nThe CFTC is authorized to set position limits for certain futures contracts in designated physical commodities and for economically equivalent options and swaps. In November 2013, the CFTC proposed rules that would place limits on positions in certain futures and equivalent swap contracts for, or linked to, certain physical commodities; subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. We do not know when the CFTC will finalize these regulations; therefore, the impact of those provisions on us is currently uncertain.\nThe CFTC designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and exchange trading. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that regulators establish margin rules for uncleared swaps. The application of such requirements may indirectly change the cost and availability of the swaps that we may use for hedging.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter or reduce our ability to monetize or restructure derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nOur commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nTo the extent that we engage in commodity-price risk management activities to protect our cash flows from commodity-price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels stated in the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the following occur:\n\u2022\nour production is less than the notional volumes;\n\u2022\na change in price basis differentials;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; and\n\u2022\nan event materially impacts oil and natural-gas prices.\nConcerns about climate change and other air quality issues may affect our operations or results.\nClimate change, the costs that may be associated with its effects and the regulation of GHGs may affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services, and reducing demand for, and consumption of, our products and services. In addition, legislative and regulatory responses to climate change may increase our operating costs. In 2006, California adopted AB 32, which established a statewide cap on GHG emissions, including on the oil and natural gas production industry, and a \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d program. Since 2012, CARB regulations have required us to obtain GHG emissions allowances corresponding to reported GHG emissions from operations and, starting in 2015, from the sale of certain products to customers for use in the State. In 2014, we incurred approximately $33 million to purchase mandatory GHG emissions allowances in California, and costs of such allowances are expected to increase in the future as CARB reduces the number of available allowances, increases their targeted price and covers more operations and products in the program. In addition, other CARB regulations, state policies and proposed legislation seek to restrict or reduce the use of petroleum products in transportation fuels and electricity generation in California and require the use of renewable energy, which could increase our costs and reduce the demand for our products and services.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. In addition, California air quality laws and regulations, particularly in Southern and Central California where most of our operations are located, are in many instances more stringent than comparable federal laws and regulations. As these requirements become more stringent, we may be unable to implement them in a cost-effective manner. As a result of existing and future air quality initiatives, we could face risks of increased costs and taxes, an inability to execute projects and reduced demand for our products and services.\nRisks related to our acquisition activities could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisition activities carry risks that we may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years and oil prices in recent months; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market\u2019s evaluation of the activity or (iv) assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due diligence. Successful acquisitions of oil and gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing for recovering the reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and incomplete, and we may be unable to make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy.\nThere may be threatened, contemplated, asserted or other claims against the acquired assets related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware or for which we are unable to obtain indemnity.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks. Our oil and gas exploration and production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities, are subject to operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, such as well blowouts, fires, explosions, releases or discharges of hazardous or toxic materials and industrial accidents. Other catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, droughts, terrorist attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect our business and the communities in which we operate. We may be unable to obtain, or may elect not to obtain, insurance for certain risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nCyber attacks could significantly affect us.\nCyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years. We rely on electronic systems and networks to communicate, control and manage our operations and prepare our financial management and reporting information.\nIf we were to experience an attack and our security measures failed, the potential consequences to our business and the communities in which we operate could be significant.\nOperational issues could restrict access to markets for the commodities we produce.\nOur ability to market our production of oil, natural gas and NGLs depends on a number of factors, including the proximity of production fields to pipelines and terminal facilities, competition for capacity on such facilities, the ability of such facilities to gather, transport or process our products and regional disruptions, such as strikes and mechanical failures. If our access to markets for commodities we produce is restricted, our costs could increase and our expected production growth may be impaired.\nRisks Related to the Spin-off\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from our separation from Occidental.\nWe may not realize the benefits that we anticipate from our separation from Occidental. These benefits include the following:\n\u2022\nenhancing our ability to grow by reinvesting substantially all of our cash flow in our business;\n\u2022\nenhancing growth and efficiency by enabling our management team to focus its attention on the development and execution of our business in a single state;\n\u2022\nenhancing our focus on, and accelerating our technical expertise in, specific reservoirs and fields in California; and\n\u2022\nenhancing our market recognition with investors because of our status as an industry leader in California.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our separation for a variety of reasons. We may not generate sufficient cash flow to fund our long-term growth plans and to generate acceptable returns. We also may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from our separation if any of the other matters identified as risks in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section were to occur.\nOur historical financial information may not be representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone public company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical financial information included in this Form 10-K has been derived partly from Occidental\u2019s accounting records and may not reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future. Occidental did not account for us, and we were not operated, as a separate, stand-alone company or as a separate segment for the historical periods presented. The costs and expenses reflected in our historical financial information include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by Occidental, including expense allocations for: (i) executive oversight, accounting, procurement, engineering, drilling, exploration, finance, internal audit, legal, risk management, tax, treasury, information technology, government relations, investor relations, public relations, financial reporting, human resources, marketing, ethics and compliance, and certain other shared services; (ii) certain employee benefits and incentives and (iii) share-based compensation, that may be different from the comparable expenses that we would have incurred had we operated as a stand-alone company. We have allocated these expenses in our historical financial information on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on estimated time spent by Occidental personnel, headcount or our relative size compared to Occidental and its subsidiaries. The costs of operating as a stand-alone public company, other than the debt-related costs, may be slightly higher than the costs reported in the 2014 historical financial statements. These estimates may not prove to be accurate. Our capital investment requirements, including acquisitions, historically have been satisfied as part of the companywide cash management practices of Occidental. Following the Spin-off, we no longer have access to Occidental\u2019s working capital, and we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements if our cash flow from operations and our existing credit facilities are not sufficient to fund our capital investment requirements.\nIn connection with our separation from Occidental, we agreed to indemnify Occidental for certain liabilities, including those related to the operation of our business while it was still owned by Occidental, and Occidental agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, which indemnities may not be adequate.\nPursuant to agreements with Occidental, Occidental has indemnified us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Occidental for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnity payments that we may be required to provide Occidental may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnity payments relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for liabilities that Occidental has agreed to retain. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Occidental will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Occidental will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Occidental any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.\nOur costs may increase as a result of operating as a stand-alone public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations.\nPrior to the Spin-off, our operations were fully integrated within Occidental, and we relied on Occidental to provide certain corporate functions. As a stand-alone public company, we may incur additional expenses for executive oversight, accounting, finance, risk management, treasury, tax, financial reporting, internal audit, legal, information technology, governmental relations, public relations, investor relations, human resources, procurement, engineering, drilling, exploration, ethics and compliance, marketing and certain other services that we have not incurred historically. As part of Occidental, we were able to enjoy certain benefits from Occidental\u2019s scale and purchasing power. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have similar negotiating leverage.\nIn addition, we are now obligated to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports, and, as a result, must ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. In addition, we are now subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of the NYSE, and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations and costs upon us.\nOur Tax Sharing Agreement with Occidental may limit our ability to take certain actions, including strategic transactions, and may require us to indemnify Occidental for significant tax liabilities.\nUnder the Tax Sharing Agreement, we have agreed to take certain actions or refrain from taking certain actions to ensure that the Spin-off and certain transactions taken in preparation for, or in connection with, the Spin-off, qualify for tax-free status under the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). We have also made various other covenants in the Tax Sharing Agreement intended to ensure the tax-free status of the Spin-off. These covenants restrict our ability to sell assets outside the ordinary course of business, to issue or sell additional common stock or other securities (including securities convertible into our common stock), or to enter into certain other corporate transactions. For example, for a period of two years after the final disposition of the securities retained by Occidental after the Spin-off, absent approval by Occidental, we may not enter into any transaction that would be reasonably likely to cause us to undergo either a 30% or greater change in the ownership of our voting stock or a 30% or greater change in the ownership (measured by value) of all classes of our stock.\nWe have agreed to indemnify Occidental for (a) taxes incurred as a result of the failure of the Spin-off or certain transactions undertaken in preparation for, or in connection with, the Spin-off, to qualify as tax-free transactions under the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to the extent caused by (i) our breach of certain tax-related representations or covenants made in connection with the Spin-off, (ii) actions, failures to act and omissions inconsistent with such representations and covenants and (iii) certain permitted transactions, (b) our separate taxes due to capitalization of intangible drilling and development costs, (c) any finally determined increases of our liability for separate tax items included in combined or consolidated Occidental returns, and (d) 50% of certain sales, use, transfer, real property transfer, intangible, recordation, registration, documentary, stamp and similar taxes. We also have agreed to pay 50% of any taxes arising from the Spin-off or related transactions to the extent that the tax is not attributable to the fault of either party. However, if we receive an increase in the tax basis of our depletable, depreciable or amortizable assets as a result of any such tax begin imposed, we will pay to Occidental any amount equal to any reduction in our tax liability attributable to such basis increase at the time such\nreduction in tax liability arises. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Occidental and its remaining subsidiaries against claims and liabilities relating to the past operation of our business.\nWe could have significant tax liabilities for periods during which Occidental operated our business.\nFor any tax periods (or portion thereof) in which Occidental owned at least 80% of the total voting power and value of our common stock, we and our subsidiaries will be included in Occidental\u2019s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we or one or more of our subsidiaries may be included in the combined, consolidated or unitary tax returns of Occidental or one or more of its subsidiaries for state or local income tax purposes. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, for each period in which we or any of our subsidiaries are consolidated or combined with Occidental for purposes of any tax return, and with respect to which such tax return has not yet been filed, we will pay Occidental for any additional taxes payable by Occidental resulting from Occidental\u2019s election to capitalize some or all of certain CRC intangible drilling costs. We will also be responsible for any increase in Occidental\u2019s federal or state tax liability for any period in which we or any of our subsidiaries are combined or consolidated with Occidental if such increase results from audit adjustments attributable to our business. In addition, by virtue of Occidental\u2019s controlling ownership and the Tax Sharing Agreement, Occidental will effectively control all of our tax decisions in connection with any consolidated, combined or unitary income tax returns in which we (or any of our subsidiaries) are included. The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that Occidental will have sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings (including tax audits) relating to us, to prepare and file all consolidated, combined or unitary income tax returns in which we are included on our behalf (including the making of any tax elections). This arrangement may result in conflicts of interest between Occidental and us. For example, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Occidental will be able to choose to contest, compromise or settle any adjustment or deficiency proposed by the relevant taxing authority in a manner that may be beneficial to Occidental and detrimental to us.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the Tax Sharing Agreement, federal law provides that each member of a consolidated group is liable for the group\u2019s entire tax obligation. Thus, to the extent Occidental or other members of Occidental\u2019s consolidated group fail to make any federal income tax payments required by law, we could be liable for the shortfall with respect to periods in which we were a member of Occidental\u2019s consolidated group. Similar principles may apply for state or local income tax purposes where we file combined, consolidated or unitary returns with Occidental or its subsidiaries for federal, foreign, state or local income tax purposes.\nThe amount of tax for which we are liable for taxable periods preceding the Spin-off may be impacted by elections Occidental makes on our behalf.\nUnder the Tax Sharing Agreement, Occidental will have the right to make all elections, including elections to capitalize intangible drilling costs, relevant to the determination of our tax liability for periods while we, or any of our subsidiaries, are required to file tax returns with Occidental on a consolidated or combined basis or which include pre-Spin-off periods. As a result, the amount of tax for which we are liable for taxable periods preceding the Spin-off may be impacted by elections Occidental makes on our behalf.\nWe could have significant tax liabilities if the Spin-off, and certain transactions in preparation therefore, are not tax-free.\nIn certain circumstances, if the Spin-off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant liabilities under a tax-sharing agreement between us and Occidental. Occidental has received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that certain aspects of the transactions that will be undertaken in preparation for, or in connection with, the Spin-off will not cause the distribution to be taxable to Occidental or its affiliates. Occidental also received opinions from tax counsel that (i) certain transactions that will be undertaken in preparation for, or in connection with, the Spin-off will not be taxable to Occidental or its affiliates for federal income tax purposes and (ii) the Spin-off generally qualifies as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355, 361 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The private letter ruling relies and the opinions rely on facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Occidental and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Occidental may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinions of its tax advisor and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, an opinion of counsel is not binding upon the IRS, so, notwithstanding the opinions of Occidental\u2019s tax advisor, the IRS could conclude upon audit that the Spin-off is taxable in full or in part. The IRS may determine that the Spin-off is taxable for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of Occidental or us after the Spin-off.\nSeveral members of our board of directors and management may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their ownership of shares of common stock of Occidental and the overlap of one member of our Board with the board of directors of Occidental.\nSeveral members of our board of directors and management will initially own common stock of Occidental or options to purchase common stock of Occidental, because of their current or prior relationships with Occidental, which could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Occidental and us. In addition, the board of directors of each of CRC and Occidental have one member in common, which could create actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nThe Spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nThe Spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Under these laws, if a court in a lawsuit by an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (including a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or Occidental or any of our respective subsidiaries) were to determine that Occidental or any of its subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for distributing our common stock or taking other action as part of the Spin-off, or that we or any of our subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness, including the new debt incurred by us in connection with the Spin-off, transferring assets or taking other action as part of the Spin-off and, at the time of such action, we, Occidental or any of our respective subsidiaries (i) was insolvent or would be rendered insolvent, (ii) had unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business and all business in which it intended to engage or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they would mature, then such court could void the Spin-off as a constructive fraudulent transfer. The court could impose a number of different remedies, including voiding our liens and claims against Occidental, or providing Occidental with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Occidental and the fair market value of our company at the time of the Spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than (i) the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities) or (ii) the amount that will be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and mature. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, Occidental or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-off, including the distribution of our common stock.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement, from and after the Spin-off, each of Occidental and CRC will be responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which it owns and operates following the consummation of the Spin-off, and each of Occidental and CRC will assume or retain certain liabilities for the operation of our respective businesses prior to the Spin-off and certain liabilities related to the Spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Occidental, particularly if Occidental were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations.\nThe agreements between us and Occidental were not made on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\nThe agreements we entered into with Occidental in connection with the Spin-off, were negotiated in the context of the Spin-off while we were still a wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were negotiated, we did not have an independent board of directors or a management team independent of Occidental. As a result, the terms of those agreements, including those that are discussed elsewhere, may be unfavorable and may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The terms relate to, among other things, the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and other obligations between Occidental and us.", "PERMNO": 15029, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CRCQQ"}
