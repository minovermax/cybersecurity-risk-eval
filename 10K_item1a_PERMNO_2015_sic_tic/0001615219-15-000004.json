Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report as well as our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have limited operating history and a history of operating loss. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a biotechnology company with limited operating history. Since inception, we have incurred a significant loss. We incurred a net loss of $8,010,860 from February 26, 2014, the date of our inception, to December 31, 2014.\nOur losses have resulted principally from expenses incurred in research and development of our proprietary treatment and from general and administrative expenses that we have incurred while building our business infrastructure. We expect to incur substantial and increased expenses as we expand our development activities and advance our clinical programs and as we accelerate the development and commercialization of our consumer brand. We also expect an increase in our expenses associated with creating additional infrastructure to support operations as a public company. As a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future.\nTo date, we have financed our operations through private placements of equity securities and the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in February 2015. We have no products approved for commercialization and have never generated any product revenues. The development of biotechnology products is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk.\nWe have never generated any product revenues and may never become profitable.\nWe have never generated any product revenues and currently do not have any marketed consumer products or drug products approved for marketing. Our ability to generate revenue from drug products and achieve profitability depends on our ability to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the marketing approvals necessary to commercialize, one or more of our drug product candidates. Until, and unless, we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities overseas for one or more of our drug product candidates, we cannot market or sell our products as drugs and will not have drug product revenues. Any drug product candidate we develop will require significant time and capital before we can apply for approval from the FDA. Further, we do not expect to begin marketing or selling a consumer product until the first half of 2016 and do not expect to generate significant revenue from our consumer products for several years, if ever. Therefore, for the foreseeable future we do not expect to achieve any significant product revenues and will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from cash on hand, licensing fees and grants, if any, and potentially, future equity or debt offerings.\nEven if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more drug product candidates, all of which are currently in the pre-clinical phase of development, we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. The successful development and commercialization of any drug product candidates will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u2022\nundertaking pre-clinical development and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nhiring additional personnel;\n\u2022\nformulating and manufacturing products, including stability testing for any drug product candidate;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approval;\n\u2022\ninitiating and conducting sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nobtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nimplementing additional internal systems and infrastructure.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. In cases where we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to market one or more of our drug product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such drug products, even if approved. Additionally, if we are not able to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of any approved drug products, we may never become profitable.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our consumer brand and products will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u2022\nfurther developing our consumer product based on the TRP activators in our proprietary treatment;\n\u2022\ndeveloping the brand strategy for our consumer product and, following launch of our consumer products, expanding our product offering and maintaining brand loyalty;\n\u2022\nentering into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third-party retailers and other potential distributors of our products; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping new product lines and extensions.\nEven if we are able to develop and commercialize a consumer brand and products, the number of athletes that suffer from EAMCs, or the frequency of EAMCs experienced by athletes, may not be as large as we estimate, and we may not generate significant revenue from sales of our consumer products, and we may never achieve profitability.\nWe may be unable to develop and commercialize any product candidate, including our consumer brand, and, even if we do, may never achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe expect that we will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and inherently uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially as we commence our proof-of-concept studies of our proprietary treatment for individuals with nocturnal leg cramps, launch and commercialize our consumer brand, our cornerstone product, and future products, commence and complete Phase 2 registration-directed clinical trials of our drug product candidate for individuals with nocturnal leg cramps if results from our proof-of-concept studies are favorable, seek marketing approvals for a drug product candidate, and advance our other product candidates. If we obtain marketing approval for a drug product candidate that we develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. We also expect an increase in our expenses associated with creating additional infrastructure to support operations as a public company.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had unrestricted cash of $33.9 million. On February 3, 2015 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $79.9 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. These proceeds include amounts received related to the sale of additional shares of our common stock pursuant to to the exercise of an overallotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering. Based upon our current operating plan, we believe our existing cash will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements until mid-2018. This estimate is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changes may occur beyond our control that would cause us to consume our available capital before that time, including changes in and progress of our development activities, acquisitions of additional drug candidates, increased costs of marketing and selling our consumer products and changes in regulation. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of any future clinical trials and our ability to successfully complete them in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe number of indications that we pursue for our drug product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain approval from the FDA to market our product candidates;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our consumer products or any drug product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of marketing authorization or regulatory clearances;\n\u2022\nthe cost of goods associated with our consumer products and drug product candidates; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates.\nWe expect that our current available funds will not be sufficient to enable us to seek marketing approval for our drug product candidate for individuals with nocturnal leg cramps or our other target indications. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources.\nIn addition, attempting to secure additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our drug product candidates or consumer brand and products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u2022\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our drug product candidates or consumer products;\n\u2022\nseek corporate partners for our drug product candidates or consumer products at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u2022\nrelinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or drug product candidates or consumer products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or\n\u2022\nsignificantly curtail, or cease, operations.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our intellectual property or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. In the event we need to seek additional funds we may raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities. In such an event, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of our common shares. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third-parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property or future revenue streams. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe have a limited operating history and no history of commercializing pharmaceutical or consumer products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability.\nWe were formed in February 2014 and, as a result, have no meaningful operations upon which to evaluate our business. Our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing our company, developing our intellectual property and developing our product candidates. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete a large-scale, pivotal clinical trial, obtain marketing approval, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third-party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval\nWe are heavily dependent on the successful development of drug product candidates based on our proprietary treatment, and we cannot be certain that any drug product candidate we develop will enter clinical trials, receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nWe currently have no drug products that are approved for commercial sale and may never successfully develop marketable drug products. We expect that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures over the next few years will be devoted to developing drug product candidates and, accordingly, our business depends heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of the drug product candidates we develop. We expect that our proof-of-concept clinical study of nocturnal leg cramps will be under the regulatory framework applicable to dietary supplements in the United States. We only expect to conduct a drug clinical trial of our drug product candidates for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps, MS spasticity, cervical dystonia and/or SCI spasticity if the results of our proof-of-concept studies are favorable. There is no guarantee that the results of our proof-of-concept studies will be favorable and that any of our drug product candidates if ultimately developed will enter drug clinical trials.\nTo date, we have only tested our proprietary treatment as a dietary supplement product candidate in healthy normal volunteers to determine whether our formulation prevents or reduces muscle cramps produced by electrical stimulation. While we understand the physical properties of the TRP activators in our proprietary treatment and their interaction with the primary sensory neurons in the mouth, esophagus, and stomach, we do not know whether it is this interaction that produced the reduction in muscle cramps observed in our three controlled studies performed to date. We are studying the TRP activators of our proprietary treatment and believe the most rapid development path will be to pursue drug product candidates with a single purified TRP activator. However, we do not know which TRP activator is most efficacious in treating or preventing muscle cramps. Further, we have not yet developed a drug product candidate that includes a single purified TRP activator molecule that has shown a statistically significant effect in reducing muscle cramps or spasms. We intend to analyze the single molecule components in each of the TRP activators in our proprietary treatment to identify the most appropriate single TRP activator molecule, or combination of multiple TRP activator molecules, to bring to drug clinical trials. We will also need to determine the most appropriate dosage level and delivery mechanism for any drug product candidate. We expect that our drug product candidates will include one or more TRP activators at higher dosage levels than any consumer products we commercialize. If we are not able to develop drug product candidates that safely and effectively treat nocturnal leg cramps or severe neuromuscular conditions, our future prospects may be limited, which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nAny drug product candidates we develop will require additional clinical development, management of clinical, pre-clinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, obtaining manufacturing supply, building of a commercial organization, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenues from product sales. Before testing any drug product, we will need to conduct non-clinical testing, also referred to as pre-clinical testing. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. Once we have completed the pre-clinical studies, we will be able to submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. We are not permitted to market any drug product candidate in the United States until it receives regulatory approval from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until it receives the requisite approval from the regulatory authorities in such countries. We have not previously submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities, and do not expect to be in a position to do so for the foreseeable future. We cannot be certain that any drug product candidates we develop will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our drug product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials, or be successfully commercialized even if\nwe receive regulatory approval. If the markets for patients that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our drug product candidates in the United States, the European Union and in additional foreign countries. While the scope of regulatory approval is similar in other countries, to obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions.\nBecause our drug product candidates and consumer product are in early stages of development, there is a high risk of failure, and we may never succeed in developing marketable products or generating product revenue.\nOur early clinical studies of our proprietary treatment in reducing electrically induced muscle cramps are not necessarily predictive of the results of any proof-of-concept clinical studies we may conduct in nocturnal leg cramps, multiple sclerosis spasticity, cervical dystonia or SCI spasticity. The technique to electrically induce, measure and analyze muscle cramps utilized in connection with our completed studies has not been widely studied, its usefulness in clinical studies has not been validated and the methods of analyzing the results have not been widely agreed upon. For instance, we have noted that subjects experience muscle fatigue from the electrical stimulation, which increases the difficulty of interpreting the results from our clinical studies. As a result, we cannot be certain that our clinical studies performed to date are an accurate predictor of the efficacy of our proprietary treatment in preventing or reducing naturally occurring muscle cramps and spasms. If our proof-of-concept clinical studies do not successfully demonstrate the efficacy of our proprietary treatment, or if we are not successful in developing drug product candidates that replicate the potential efficacy of our proprietary treatment, our ability to develop and commercialize our drug product candidates may be limited.\nOur consumer product is still under development and may require significant effort to make it more palatable. If we are not successful in refining the product attributes of our consumer product, we may not be able to derive significant revenue following the launch of our consumer brand.\nBecause of the small number of subjects in our clinical studies performed to date, the results from our completed clinical studies may be less reliable than results achieved in larger clinical studies.\nA study design that is considered appropriate includes a sufficiently large sample size with appropriate statistical power, as well as proper control of bias, to allow a meaningful interpretation of the results. In Flex-001, Flex-002 and Flex-003, we analyzed the effect of our proprietary treatment on reducing electrically induced muscle cramps in 37 healthy normal volunteers. The results of studies with smaller sample sizes, such as Flex-001, Flex-002 and Flex-003, can be disproportionately influenced by the impact the treatment had on a few individuals, which limits the ability to generalize the results across a broader community, thus making the study results less reliable than studies with a larger number of subjects. As a result, there may be less certainty that our proprietary treatment would achieve a statistically significant effect in any future clinical studies. If we conduct any future clinical studies of our proprietary treatment, we may not achieve a statistically significant result or the same level of statistical significance seen in our completed studies.\nClinical development involves an expensive and time-consuming process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nWe have completed three clinical studies of our proprietary treatment, and plan to conduct proof-of-concept studies of our proprietary treatment, under the regulatory framework applicable to dietary supplements. The FDA has indicated that products intended for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps may be marketed as either dietary supplements or drugs. The FDA regulates products on the basis of their intended use, with products claiming to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease being regulated as drugs, and dietary supplements being dietary ingredients intended for ingestion which are permitted to be the subject of claims about their effect on the structure or function of the body. To date, we have developed our proprietary treatment as a dietary supplement for the treatment and prevention of muscle cramps. While we intend to develop drug products to treat nocturnal leg cramps, the studies of our proprietary treatment conducted in 2014 were not, and our planned proof-of-concept study for nocturnal leg cramps will not be, conducted pursuant to FDA's regulations governing the clinical testing of drugs. Rather, these studies have been, and will be, conducted pursuant to the requirements for the clinical testing of dietary supplements.\nWe are planning to develop drug product candidates for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps and spasms associated with severe neuromuscular conditions. However, we have not commenced or completed any clinical trials of these drug product candidates for any of our targeted indications and before we are able to begin clinical trials of drug product candidates in the United States, we will be required to submit an IND to the FDA. An IND requires the submission of manufacturing information, analytical data, the results of nonclinical trials, a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, and the FDA's primary objective in reviewing an IND is to assure the safety of subjects. We have not completed any toxicology studies of any drug product candidates in assays and animals and there can be no guarantee that our drug product candidates can be safely administered to patients. In contrast, clinical studies of dietary supplements do not require the submission of an IND, although they do require approval of an institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee. Therefore, we plan to take advantage of the regulatory framework that permits clinical studies of dietary supplements without an IND for our proof-of-concept studies in individuals with nocturnal leg cramps, and if our proof-of-concept studies are successful, we plan to pursue any future development of our drug product candidates based on our proprietary treatment subject to the IND requirements. The FDA may not agree that studies performed without an IND, even if for GRAS substances in an indication that the FDA has stated is eligible for regulation as a dietary supplement on the basis of its claims, are adequate to support an IND for a disease indication. Further, the FDA may disagree with our strategy to elect to study our proprietary treatment for nocturnal leg cramps in clinical studies as a dietary supplement without an IND.\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we expect at least one individual to complete treatment in our first human proof-of-concept study of our proprietary treatment for individuals with nocturnal leg cramps. We may also initiate additional proof-of-concept studies of our proprietary treatment for nocturnal leg cramps, multiple sclerosis spasticity, cervical dystonia or SCI spasticity. Our planned proof-of-concept studies and any future clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients, or be completed on schedule, if at all. The FDA may place any IND or clinical trial that we propose on clinical hold, which would require that we resolve any concerns prior to being permitted to initiate or continue clinical development. The protocol for our study in the United States was accepted by an IRB and we have submitted a protocol to a local ethics committee in each of the United Kingdom and Australia. In order to begin our proposed proof-of-concept studies outside the United States, we may also need approval from the applicable regulatory agency in the jurisdiction where the study will take place. If these regulatory authorities do not approve our proof-of-concept studies for any reason, our ability to develop drug products based on our proprietary treatment may be limited.\nIn addition, human clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA may not agree with our proposed endpoints for any clinical trial of our drug product candidates, which may delay the commencement of our drug clinical trials in the United States. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. We estimate that clinical trials of our drug candidates will take several years to complete, and their outcomes are inherently uncertain. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the clinical trial process, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. Drug product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical trials, and the results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials of our drug product candidates therefore may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. A number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain independent IRB approval at each trial site;\n\u2022\naddition of new trial sites;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\ndetermination of dosing issues;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness during later-stage clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment or failure to recruit suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\nfailure to manufacture sufficient quantities of a drug candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment, including failure to have patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up; and\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of clinical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians' and patients' perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Furthermore, we intend to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and while we will have agreements governing their committed activities, we will have limited influence over their actual performance.\nWe, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for a clinical trial or the IRB or ethics committee of an institution in which a clinical trial is being conducted, may suspend or terminate our clinical trials at any time due to a number of factors, including, if it appears that we or our collaborators are failing to conduct a trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocol, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for commencement and completion of future clinical trials. If we experience delays in the commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials, or if we terminate a clinical trial prior to completion, the commercial prospects of our product candidates could be harmed, and our ability to generate revenues from the candidates may be delayed. In addition, any delays in our clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down the development and, in the case of our drug product candidates, the approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our drug product candidates.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nOur drug product candidates will require regulatory approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities before we can market them. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials, and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a drug product candidate's clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any drug product candidate, and it is possible that we may never obtain regulatory approval of any drug product candidate that we seek to develop in the future.\nObtaining approval of an NDA is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and inherently uncertain process, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may delay, limit or deny approval of our drug product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate that our drug product candidates are safe and effective as treatments for our targeted indications to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe CRO that we retain to conduct clinical studies and trials may take actions outside of our control that materially adversely impact our clinical studies and trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not find the data from pre-clinical and clinical studies sufficient to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of our drug product candidates outweigh their safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from our pre-clinical and clinical studies or may require that we conduct additional studies;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our drug product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nif our NDA is reviewed by an advisory committee, the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval, additional pre-clinical studies or clinical studies, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of our third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical or commercial supplies; or\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nIn addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our drug product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a drug product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that drug product candidate. Any of the foregoing scenarios could harm the commercial prospects for our drug product candidates.\nOur drug product candidates or consumer products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could impact their market acceptance, or in the case of our drug product candidates, delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our drug product candidates could cause us, clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval. None of the subjects in Flex-001, Flex-002 and Flex-003 reported any serious adverse events, or SAEs. However, there is no guarantee that subjects in our future clinical trials will not experience SAEs. For instance, capsaicin, one of the active ingredients in our proprietary treatment, is an irritant and produces a sensation of burning in tissue with which it comes into contact. Given orally, capsaicin can induce the effects associated with the ingestion of spicy food, including an increase of salivation and gastric secretion, warm to intolerable burning and gastrointestinal disorders depending on the dose. Some epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation of stomach cancer incidences with geographic areas known to consume a chili pepper-rich diet. However, the causal connections between capsicum and cancer based on these epidemiological studies is difficult to ascertain given other factors, such as smoking and exposure to environmental pollutants commonly found in developing countries. Further, recent studies utilizing high-purity capsaicin and standardized protocols suggest that the carcinogenic potential of capsaicin is minimal. Capsaicinoids are prescribed as topical analgesics for the treatment of neuropathic pain and in low amounts as an over-the-counter treatment for the temporary relief of muscle pain. Even at low doses capsaicinoids are irritants, causing burning sensation, swelling and pain on the skin and mucous membranes. These or other side effects could affect subject recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete clinical trials or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nFurther, if any of our drug product candidates receives marketing approval or we begin marketing our consumer product, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approval for the drug products or impose restrictions on their distribution in the form of a modified REMS;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional labeling statements on the drug products such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a medication guide for the drug products outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to individuals;\n\u2022\nwe could elect to discontinue the sale of our consumer products; or\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected drug product candidate, if approved, or consumer product, if marketed, and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing and extensive regulatory requirements and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our drug product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our drug product candidates may be subject to significant restrictions on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, or post-market surveillance. Any drug product candidate we develop, if approved, will also be subject to ongoing and extensive FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, export, import, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. In the United States, the holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA to the FDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA regulations, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and are subject to FDA review.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where or the processes by which the product is manufactured, or if we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on the marketing and/or manufacturing of the product, withdraw the product from the market or require mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nseize or detain product or refuse to permit the import or export of the product; or\n\u2022\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue. In addition, regulatory policies may change\nand additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third-Parties\nWe rely on third-parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third-parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to market our consumer product or obtain marketing approval for or commercialize our drug product candidates and our business could be materially harmed.\nWe rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our clinical programs, including our proof-of-concept studies. We rely on these parties for execution of our clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with FDA laws and regulations regarding current good clinical practices, or GCPs, which are also required by the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in the form of International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines for all of our drug product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical studies or trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. While we have agreements governing activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over their actual performance. In addition, portions of the proof-of-concept studies of our proprietary treatment are expected to be conducted outside of the United States, which will make it more difficult for us to monitor CROs and perform visits of our clinical trial sites and will force us to rely heavily on CROs to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and compliance with applicable regulations, including GCPs. Failure to comply with applicable regulations in the conduct of our clinical trials may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nSome of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us upon reasonable notice or if, among other reasons, we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated. If any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to timely enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drug product candidates. Consequently, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our drug product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed significantly.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely completely on third-parties to manufacture our supplies for our clinical studies and we intend to rely on third-parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved drug product candidate and our consumer products, if marketed. Our commercialization of any of our drug product candidates or consumer product could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third-parties fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA or\ncomparable regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have nor do we plan to acquire the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our consumer products or the clinical supplies of our proprietary treatment for our planned proof-of-concept studies, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture on a commercial scale. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our drug product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit an NDA to the FDA. While we will work closely with our third-party manufacturers on the manufacturing process for our drug product candidates, including by conducting quality audits, we generally will not control the manufacturing process of, and will be completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers for compliance with cGMP regulatory requirements and for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products for our drug product candidates and dietary supplement cGMP regulatory requirements for our consumer product. If we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of the TRP activators in our proprietary treatment or drug product candidates for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, our clinical trials. We have no control over the ability of our contract manufactuers or other third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If our contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities for the drug product candidates and may not be able to continue manufacturing the consumer products under development. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our drug product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, or if these facilities are found not to be compliant with the regulatory requirements for the manufacture of drug products or dietary supplements, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our drug product candidates, if approved, and to market our consumer product.\nWe rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our proprietary treatment for our proof-of-concept clinical studies and our consumer products and expect to continue to rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-parties the materials necessary to produce our products if and when they are commercially marketed. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. There may be only a limited number of these suppliers, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying and qualifying an acceptable supplier of the raw materials we require. Even if successful, the process of identifying and qualifying a replacement supplier or a contract manufacturer or other third-party manufacturer could cause a delay in the supply of a drug product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial. Any such significant delay in supply could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our drug product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase the raw materials we require after regulatory approval has been obtained for our drug product candidates, the commercial launch of our drug product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our drug product candidates.\nWe have not completed the development work for our consumer products. There is no guarantee that once this development work has been completed, we will be able to identify suitable manufacturers for the commercial production of our consumer products or that we will be able to enter into agreements with these manufacturers on favorable terms. If we are not able to identify appropriate manufacturers or enter into reasonable agreements with such manufacturers, our ability to commercialize our consumer products will be limited, which could have a material adverse impact upon our business.\nWe may not be successful in establishing development and commercialization collaborations, which failure could adversely affect, and potentially prohibit, our ability to develop our product candidates.\nDeveloping drug products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products is expensive and, therefore, we anticipate exploring collaborations with third-parties that have more resources and experience than we do. In situations where we enter into a development and commercial collaboration arrangement for a drug product candidate, we may also seek to establish additional collaborations for development and commercialization in territories outside of those addressed by the first collaboration arrangement for such drug product candidate. If any of our drug product candidates\nreceives marketing approval, we may enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third-parties with respect to otherwise unlicensed or unaddressed territories outside of the United States. There are a limited number of potential partners, and we expect to face competition in seeking appropriate partners. If we are unable to enter into any development and commercial collaborations and/or sales and marketing arrangements on reasonable and acceptable terms, if at all, we may be unable to successfully develop and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates and/or effectively market and sell future approved products, if any, in some or all of the territories outside of the United States where it may otherwise be valuable to do so.\nEstablishing manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and marketing and selling consumer products, is expensive and, therefore, we anticipate entering into collaborations with third-parties that have more resources and experience than we do. In particular, we do not have, nor do we intend to hire, a large sales force to market consumer products under our consumer brand. Until we complete the development of our cornerstone consumer product, we may find it difficult to attract qualified partners. Even after the development of our cornerstone product is completed, we expect to face competition in seeking appropriate partners. If we are unable to enter into any development and commercial collaborations and/or sales and marketing arrangements on reasonable and acceptable terms, if at all, we may be unable to suitably manufacture our consumer products candidates and/or effectively market and sell our consumer products.\nTo the extent that we decide not to, or are unable to, enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, significant capital expenditures, management resources and time will be required to establish and develop an in-house marketing and sales force with the necessary technical expertise. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to establish or maintain effective in-house sales and distribution capabilities.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining development and commercialization collaborations, and any partner may not devote sufficient resources to the development or commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in development or commercialization efforts.\nEven if we are able to establish collaboration arrangements with third-parties, any such collaboration may not ultimately be successful, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. If we partner with a third-party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the third-party. It is possible that a partner may not devote sufficient resources to the development or commercialization of our product candidate or may otherwise fail in development or commercialization efforts, in which event the development and commercialization of such product candidate could be delayed or terminated and our business could be substantially harmed. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing development of a product candidate or research program under a collaboration, and the payment we receive from our partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development. Moreover, collaborations and sales and marketing arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement and they may require substantial resources to maintain. Even if we were successful in establishing a collaboration, conflicts may arise between us and our partners, such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of clinical data, the achievement of milestones, the interpretation of financial provisions or the ownership of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. If any such conflicts arise, a partner could act in its own self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interests. Any such disagreement between us and a partner could result in the delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates and, in turn could prevent us from generating sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by employees and independent contractors, such as principal investigators, CROs, manufacturers, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include the disclosure of unauthorized activities to us or intentional or negligent failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, to report financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including, but not limited to certain activities related to research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by employees and other third-parties could also involve\nthe improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical studies and trials. In addition, federal procurement laws impose substantial penalties for misconduct in connection with government contracts and require certain contractors to maintain a code of business ethics and conduct.\nWe have adopted a code of business ethics and conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third-parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent improper activities may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Drug Product Candidates and Consumer Brand and Products\nComplying with new and existing government regulations for our consumer product, both in the United States and abroad, could significantly increase our costs or delay or prevent the development or potential commercialization of our consumer brand.\nThe processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of our consumer products is subject to regulation by several U.S. federal agencies, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, the Postal Service, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state, local and foreign laws and agencies of the localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction or require the reformulation of our products.\nWe believe our consumer products for the prevention of EAMC will be regulated as dietary supplements by the FDA, which we believe is an appropriate marketing claim for a dietary supplement and not a disease claim that would render the product subject to regulation as a drug. The FDA regulates, among other things, the manufacture, composition, safety, packaging, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). The FDA may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient that we may market presents an unacceptable health risk. If that occurs, we could be required to cease distribution of and/or recall dietary supplements containing that ingredient.\nThe FDA or FTC may also determine that certain labeling, advertising and promotional claims, statements or activities with respect to a dietary supplement are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and may determine that a particular statement is an unapproved health claim, a drug claim, a false or misleading claim, or a deceptive advertising claim. Any such determination or any other failure to comply with FDA or other regulatory requirements could prevent us from marketing our consumer product as a dietary supplement and subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties.\nThe Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, now requires food companies, including dietary supplement companies, to register with the FDA biennially. The FSMA permits summary suspension of registrations (and elimination of the right to sell products in interstate commerce) based on findings by the FDA that a product might present an unreasonable risk of serious illness, injury or death. In addition, legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate which seeks to provide the FDA with increased authority to regulate dietary supplements and to increase labeling requirements with respect to dietary supplements. Other legislation introduced but not passed by Congress would require the FDA Commissioner to obtain a list of all ingredients and claims for dietary supplements and distinguish from among them which products are potentially unsafe and which claims are misleading. FDA and FTC are also cooperating in joint enforcement projects, including the issuance of warning and enforcement letters by both agencies. The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failing to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for using false or misleading advertising claims. The FTC routinely polices the market for deceptive dietary supplement advertising and accepts and reviews complaints from the public concerning such advertising.\nIn Europe, non-compliance by us or others of relevant legislation can result in regulators bringing administrative or, in some cases, criminal proceedings. European Union regulations and directives are implemented and enforced by individual member states and, so, enforcement priorities and applicable law can occur in multiple countries at one\ntime. Failure by us, the manufacturers or suppliers to comply with applicable legislation could result in prosecution and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEurope has adopted broad regulations and directives on health and nutrition claims. These regulations cover claims that can be made for foods, including dietary supplements, and certain claims may be prohibited or require prior approval. Unless subject to derogation, products that include certain claims cannot be lawfully marketed in EU member states absent preapproval.\nIn addition, an EU Directive (Directive 2001/95/EC as amended) governing product safety requires manufacturers to notify regulators about unsafe products and gives regulators in each member state the power to order product recalls. As a result, the number of product recalls in Europe has increased substantially. A product recall in Europe could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies which, if not favorable to our drug candidates, could hinder or prevent our products' commercial success.\nOur ability to commercialize our drug candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors establish appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for our drug candidates and related treatments. As a threshold for coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors generally require that drug products be approved for marketing by the FDA. A trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. Third-party payors also are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. Therefore, as a result of these cost containment measures, coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any drug product that we commercialize and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. We do not expect any third-party payors to cover and reimburse for our consumer products.\nIn the United States, private third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. However, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained at all. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could significantly harm our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize our product candidates and our overall financial condition.\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our drug product candidates, if approved, among physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any drug product candidate, the product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community, which is critical to commercial success. Market acceptance of any drug product candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of the drug product candidate as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the drug product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, the medical community and patients of the drug product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nthe convenience of prescribing and initiating patients on the drug product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of such drug product candidate over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including any similar generic treatments;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors including government authorities;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.\nMany drug products approved for treatment of a particular disease are not effective in treating all patients suffering from a disease and there is no guarantee that our drug product candidates, if approved, will be effective in treating all patients. In the clinical studies of our proprietary treatment performed to date, 49% of subjects tested produced results that were inconclusive or showed our proprietary treatment did not reduce the subject's electrically induced muscle cramps. Our drug product candidates will be based on the same TRP activators found in our proprietary treatment. If the results of future clinical trials of our drug product candidates produce the same results as the results from the studies of our consumer products, physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community may not accept our drug product candidates as treatment options. If our drug product candidates are approved but fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community, we will not be able to generate significant revenue, and we may not become or remain profitable.\nWe may incur product liability claims, which could increase our costs and/or materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe testing and marketing of drug products and consumer products entail an inherent risk of product liability. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Retailers and formulators of products designed for human consumption may be subject to product liability claims if the use of their products is alleged to have resulted in illness or injury or if their products include inadequate instructions or warnings. As a dietary supplement that does not contain new dietary ingredients, our consumer products will not be subject to pre-market regulatory approval or review in the United States by the FDA or other governmental authorities. Our consumer products could contain spoiled or contaminated substances, and some of our products may contain ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. We could be subject to product liability claims, including among others, that our products include insufficient instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. Any product liability claim against us could result in increased costs and adversely affect our reputation with our customers, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInsurance coverage, even where available, may not be sufficient to cover losses we may incur, which could increase our costs and lower our profits.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our products and operations. For example, we may be liable for claims brought by users of our products or by employees, customers or other third-parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations. We will seek to minimize these risks through various insurance policies from third-party insurance carriers. Currently, we have only limited product liability insurance coverage and the insurance industry has become more selective in offering certain types of insurance, including product liability, product recall and property casualty insurance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain such coverage or obtain comparable coverage on terms and conditions favorable to us, if at all. Further, we anticipate that any additional insurance coverage we may obtain will be subject to large individual claim deductibles, individual claim and aggregate policy limits and other terms and conditions. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient to cover our losses. Any losses that are not completely covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including preventing or limiting the commercialization of drug products and consumer products we develop, alone or with collaborators.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer acceptance of our consumer product or of dietary supplements, generally, could reduce our sales.\nWe expect to be dependent upon consumer acceptance of the safety, efficacy and quality of our products. Consumer acceptance of products can be significantly influenced by customer reviews, scientific research or findings, national media attention and other publicity about product use. A product may initially be received favorably, resulting in high sales associated with that product that may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change. Alternatively, skepticism of claims made by companies in the dietary supplement industry may limit the number of individuals that believe our consumer products are effective in preventing muscle cramps, which may negatively our ability to generate significant sales from our consumer products.\nFor instance, many consumers currently believe that hydration, stretching and sports drinks are sufficient to prevent EAMC. To successfully market our consumer product, we will need to convince consumers that these treatments, alone, are insufficient in relieving or preventing muscle cramps. Changing consumer behavior patterns may take months or years to accomplish and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. Furthermore, our proprietary treatment has been shown only to relieve the intensity of muscle cramps if taken prior to the individuals' experiencing a muscle cramp. We do not know if our consumer products will be effective in relieving a muscle cramp that has already begun and, as a result, consumers may need to take our consumer products in advance of activities where they believe a muscle cramp is likely to occur. There is no guarantee that consumers will be willing to use our consumer products as a preventative measure. If consumers are not willing to purchase our products as a preventative measure, our ability to generate significant revenue from the sale of our consumer product may be limited.\nScientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to the dietary supplement industry or any of our particular products. Any research or publicity that is perceived by our consumers as less than favorable or that questions earlier favorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue. Adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, statements by regulatory authorities or otherwise, whether or not accurate, that associates consumption of our products or any other similar products with illness or other adverse events, or that questions the benefits of our or similar products, or that claims that such products are ineffective could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our drug product candidates are not shown to be more effective in relieving muscle cramps than our consumer product, then the market for our drug product candidates may be limited.\nBoth our consumer products and drug product candidates may include the same TRP activators found in our proprietary treatment. We expect to formulate our consumer products to address the needs of athletes and to formulate our drug product candidates to address the needs of individuals suffering from nocturnal leg cramps and severe neuromuscular disorders. As a dietary supplement, we intend to market our consumer products only to athletes suffering from EAMC and not individuals suffering from a disease. However, if our drug product candidates are not shown to be more effective than our consumer products in preventing muscle cramps, or patients or physicians believe our consumer products are just as effective as any approved drug product candidates, individuals suffering from nocturnal leg cramps or severe neuromuscular diseases may elect to use our consumer products rather than our drug product candidates, if approved, which may limit the market for our drug products candidates.\nIf we experience product recalls, we may incur significant and unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product recalls, withdrawals or seizures if any of the products we sell are believed to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the labeling, promotion, sale or distribution of our products. A recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of our products could materially and adversely affect consumer confidence in our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, a recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of our products would require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our drug product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our drug product candidates profitably, if they are approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, the ACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have or will\nsignificantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nan increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50.0% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133.0% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nnew requirements under the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of ACA and its implementing regulations that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to HHS information related to \"payments or other transfers of value\" made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals and that applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations report annually to HHS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members, with data collection currently required and reporting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services required by the 90th day of each calendar year;\n\u2022\na new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;\n\u2022\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u2022\ncreation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress does not act on the recommendations; and\n\u2022\nestablishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the\ngovernment to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. Further, under the recently enacted Drug Quality and Security Act, drug manufacturers will be subject to product identification, tracing and verification requirements, among other requirements, that are designed to improve the detection and removal of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated or otherwise potentially harmful drugs from the U.S. drug supply chain. These requirements will be phased in over several years and compliance with this new law will likely increase the costs of the manufacture and distribution of drug products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures or may be adopted in the future, may, among other things, result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such litigation. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur operations are, and will continue to be, directly, and indirectly, through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willingly soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons and entities from among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payments that are false or fraudulent or making or using a false record or statements, to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the civil False Claims Act, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government, known as \"qui tam\" actions, and such individuals, commonly known as \"whistleblowers,\" may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies to have to defend a civil False Claims Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters.\nThe recently enacted ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, also impose obligations on covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered\nentity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nThe federal Open Payments program, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, impose new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report certain payments and transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\nAdditionally, many states have laws comparable to those described above, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor.\nWe are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of these or other fraud and abuse laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we cannot compete successfully for market share against other pharmaceutical companies, dietary supplement companies, and consumer brand companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenue and our business will suffer.\nWe will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u2022\ndeveloping drugs;\n\u2022\nundertaking pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs;\n\u2022\nformulating and manufacturing drugs; and\n\u2022\nlaunching, marketing and selling drugs.\nCompetition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than any of our current or future product candidates, or achieve earlier patent protection, marketing approval, product commercialization and market penetration than us. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render some of our current of future product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our products against competitors. If we are unable to compete successfully with these and other potential future competitors, we may be unable to grow and sustain our revenue.\nIn addition, our consumer products will compete against larger companies developing and marketing dietary supplement and consumer products. We believe the principal elements of competition in the consumer product industry are price, selection, brand recognition, distribution channel offerings and the effectiveness of the product. If our consumer product gains market acceptance, we are likely to experience increased competition for those products as more participants enter the market. Certain of our competitors are larger than us and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and greater resources for marketing, advertising and product promotion. They may be able to secure inventory from vendors on more favorable terms, operate with a lower cost structure or adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our competitors may also be more effective and efficient in introducing new products. We may not be able to compete effectively, and our attempt to do so may require us to increase marketing and/or reduce our prices, which may result in lower margins. Failure to effectively compete could materially adversely affect our market share, financial condition and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain motivate qualified personnel.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain motivate qualified personnel. Our future success depends on our ability to retain our founders and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are highly dependent on Christoph Westphal, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, as well as the other principal members of our management and scientific teams, including our scientific co-founders, Bruce Bean, Ph.D. and Roderick MacKinnon, M.D. Although we have an employment agreement with Dr. Westphal, such agreement does not prevent him from terminating his employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of March 6, 2015, we had 19 full-time employees and two part-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to need additional research and development, managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022\nmanaging our clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022\npreparing for and executing on the launch of our consumer brand;\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n\u2022\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to other third-parties;\n\u2022\nimproving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping our compliance infrastructure and processes to ensure compliance with complex regulations and industry standards regarding us and our product candidates.\nAs our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third-parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical studies and trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nIf we fail to develop, acquire or in-license other product candidates or products, our business and prospects will be limited.\nOur long-term growth strategy is to develop, acquire or in-license and commercialize a portfolio of product candidates. We do not have internal new drug discovery capabilities. As a result, our primary means of expanding our pipeline of product candidates is to select and acquire or in-license product candidates for the treatment of therapeutic indications that complement or augment our current target indications, or that otherwise fit into our development or strategic plans on terms that are acceptable to us. Developing new formulations of existing products or identifying, selecting and acquiring or licensing promising product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources expertise. Efforts to do so may not result in the actual development, acquisition or license of a particular product candidate, potentially resulting in a diversion of our management's time and the expenditure of our resources with no resulting benefit. If we are unable to add additional product candidates to our pipeline, our long-term business and prospects may be limited.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our intellectual property and potential products, and if we cannot obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to successfully market our potential products.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other technologies. We will only be able to protect these\ntechnologies and products from unauthorized use by third-parties to the extent they are covered by valid and enforceable intellectual property rights, including patents, or other market exclusionary rights apply.\nWe have applied for patent protection in the United States and in some, but not all, foreign countries, including claims directed at mechanisms and methods relating to our product candidates, formulations and enabling technology such as our electrical stimulation technique for inducing muscle cramping. Any changes we make to our formulations, however, may not be covered by our existing patent applications, and we may be required to file new applications or seek other forms of protection as a result. In addition, none of the active ingredients in our proprietary treatment can be protected by a patent covering its chemical composition of matter since each ingredient has long been in the public domain. Consequently, we will rely on method of use and formulation patent protection for our proprietary treatment, and will rely on this patent protection for any drug product candidates and consumer products we develop, which may not provide the same level of protection as composition of matter patent protection. In countries where we have not and do not seek patent protection, third-parties may be able to manufacture and sell our products without our permission, and we may not be able to stop them from doing so.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology companies, like ours, can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy has emerged in the United States regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents covering the technology in the pharmaceutical field. The general environment for pharmaceutical patents outside the United States also involves significant uncertainty. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may ultimately issue on our patent applications, or that the scope of these patent rights will provide a degree of protection on our product candidates and future products and technology sufficient to permit us to gain or maintain our competitive advantage with respect to these products and technology. For example, we cannot predict:\n\u2022\nthe degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third-parties will find ways to design around our patent claims and make, use, sell, offer to sell or import competitive products without infringing our patents;\n\u2022\nif and when patents will issue;\n\u2022\nwhether others will obtain patents claiming inventions similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications; or\n\u2022\nwhether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings in connection with patent rights, which may be costly regardless of whether we win or lose.\nIn addition, others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies that may be outside the scope of our intellectual property. For example, a third-party may develop a competitive product that provides therapeutic benefits similar to those of one or more of our product candidates but that has a different composition that falls outside the scope of our patent protection. Furthermore, others may have invented technology claimed by our patents before we did so, and they may have filed patents claiming such technology before we did so, which would weaken our ability to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for such technology. Should third-parties obtain patent rights to similar products or technology, this may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we or our current licensors or licensees, or any future licensors or licensees, fail to adequately prosecute, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates could be harmed and we might not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. Further, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and various foreign patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. Noncompliance with these requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Losing our patent rights could enable competitors to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case. Any such failure to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information to third-parties, or to ensure that all inventions are assigned to us, our competitive position may be impaired.\nIn addition to patents, we may also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Trade secrets, however, are difficult to protect. We seek to protect this information, in part, through the use of non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors and others. While we believe that we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our\nown or our strategic partners' employees, consultants, contractors or advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have contributed to our intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our agreements with such parties will not be breached. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential and proprietary information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be publicly disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nIn addition, to the extent that consultants or key employees apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our potential products, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights in such information, which may not be resolved in our favor. Consultants and key employees that work with our confidential and proprietary technologies are required to assign all intellectual property rights in their discoveries to us. However, these consultants or key employees may terminate their relationship with us, and we cannot preclude them indefinitely from dealing with our competitors. If our trade secrets become known to competitors with greater experience and financial resources, the competitors may copy or use our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies. If we were to prosecute a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it could be expensive and time consuming and the outcome could be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than courts in the United States. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, we would lack any contractual or other legal claim to prevent them from using such information, and our business could be harmed.\nThird-parties may claim that we or our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property of a third-party, including know-how or trade secrets, or may claim ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, consultants and contractors were previously employed at or engaged by other biotechnology, pharmaceutical, food and dietary supplement companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, consultants and contractors, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and contractors do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees, consultants and contractors have used or disclosed such intellectual property, including know-how, trade secrets or other proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, or access to consultants and contractors. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nChanges to the patent law in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. Recent patent reform legislation in the United States and other countries, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or Leahy-Smith Act, signed into law on September 16, 2011, could increase those uncertainties and costs.\nThe Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. In addition, the Leahy-Smith Act has transformed the U.S. patent system into a \"first to file\" system. The first-to-file provisions, however, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not yet clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could make it more difficult to obtain patent protection for our inventions and increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Further, there have been recent proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the United States and other countries that, if adopted, could impact our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology or our ability to enforce our proprietary technology. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. In particular, under recent Supreme Court precedent, it is unclear to what extent naturally occurring material must be transformed in order to become eligible for patentability. Any future decisions by the Supreme Court, or by another governing body in a jurisdiction where we hold patent protection for our products, that narrow such eligibility would result in the diminishment, and potentially the complete loss, of patent protection afforded our products.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third-parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third-parties exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are developing drug product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our drug product candidates may be subject to third-party claims of patent infringement.\nThird-parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our proprietary treatment, our consumer products and/or our drug product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications of which we are unaware that ultimately result in issued patents that our drug product candidates and consumer products may infringe. In addition, third-parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our drug product candidates, any drug substance formed during our manufacturing process or any of our final products themselves, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such drug product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations or methods of use, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable drug product candidate unless we obtain a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making claims against us may request and/or obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our drug product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would subject us to substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third-parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products or manufacturing processes, which may be impossible and in any case would require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third-parties to advance our research, manufacture clinical study and trial supplies or to facilitate commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents will not be enforced against our products, which could result in either an injunction prohibiting our sales or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties or other forms of compensation to third-parties.\nWe may be required to initiate costly and time-consuming litigation in order to enforce our proprietary rights.\nEven where laws provide us with patent protection covering our products, litigation could become necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, which would require significant time and expense and divert the resources of management, and the outcome of any such litigation would be highly uncertain. If we or one of our future collaboration partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering the product candidate, the defendant could counterclaim that our asserted patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Patents may be unenforceable if someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcomes of proceedings involving assertions of invalidity and unenforceability are unpredictable.\nIt is possible that prior art exists of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution, which could render our patents invalid. Moreover, it is also possible that existing prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe is relevant to our current or future patents, could nevertheless be determined to render our patents invalid. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability of our patents covering one of our product candidates, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. Such a loss of patent protection would harm our business. Moreover, our competitors, some of whom may have substantially greater intellectual property portfolios and resources than we do, could counterclaim in any suit to enforce our patents that we infringe their intellectual property.\nInterference, derivation or other proceedings brought at the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or patentability of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our licensors or potential collaboration partners. Litigation or USPTO proceedings brought by us may fail or may be invoked against us by third-parties. Even if we are successful, domestic or foreign litigation or USPTO or foreign patent office proceedings may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States.\nAn adverse determination of any litigation or other proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, interpreted narrowly or amended such that they do not cover our product candidates. Moreover, such adverse determinations could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, or issuing with limited and potentially inadequate scope to cover our product candidates or to prevent others from marketing similar products.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or other proceedings. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation or proceedings, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments or public access to related documents. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our ordinary shares could be significantly harmed.\nOur inability or failure to adequately protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand image and limit our ability to penetrate new markets.\nWe believe trademarks will be an important element of the success of our consumer brand and products. We are currently considering product naming alternatives and will apply for federal registration of any trademarks with the USPTO and the registries of countries where our consumer products are likely to be marketed. There can be no assurance that we will obtain registrations that we apply for or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. If a third-party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand image could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nPrior to our recently completed initial public offering, there was no public market for our common stock. We cannot assure you that an active, liquid trading market for our shares will develop or persist. The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in commencing or completing our proof-of-concept studies and future clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain additional funding;\n\u2022\nany delay in filing an IND for any drug product candidate and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA's review of that IND;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully develop and commercialize our drug product candidates or consumer products;\n\u2022\nfailure to generate significant sales for our consumer products;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our consumer products or drug product candidates, including without limitation, coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate product supply for our drug product candidates or consumer product, or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nany delay in launching or otherwise commercializing our consumer brand and products;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed product development or financial projections we provide to the public;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry or dietary supplement industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop.\nPrior to our recently completed initial public offering, there has not been a public market for our common stock and an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not develop, you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, 5% or greater stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 47.5% of our voting stock. Therefore, these stockholders will have the ability to exert significant control over us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that\nyou may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders or entrench our management and/or the board of directors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies,\" including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nEven after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \"smaller reporting company\" which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe will incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nWe completed our initial public offering on February 3, 2015. As a newly public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, and The NASDAQ Global Market have imposed various requirements on public companies. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as \"say on pay\" and proxy access. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact (in ways we cannot currently anticipate) the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and\nregulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage. We estimate that we will incur between $1.5 million and $2.0 million per year in legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of being a public company. However, it is difficult to predict or estimate with any certainty the amount of such additional expenses and, as a result, our actual expenses may differ significantly from our estimates.\nThese rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAll of our stockholders prior to our initial public offering are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of our initial public offering that restrict the stockholders' ability to transfer shares of our common stock for at least 180 days from January 28, 2015, the date of the final prospectus for our initial public offering. The lock-up agreements limit the number of shares of common stock that may be sold immediately following our initial public offering. Subject to certain limitations, including sales volume limitations with respect to shares held by our affiliates, substantially all of our outstanding shares prior to our initial public offering will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the lock-up period. In addition, shares issued or issuable upon exercise of options and warrants vested as of the expiration of the lock-up period will be eligible for sale at that time. Sales of stock by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nCertain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, subject to the 180-day lock-up arrangement described above. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 plan, our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. The number of shares available for future grant under the 2015 plan will automatically increase each year by 4% of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31 of the prior calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. Currently, we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 plan each year. If our board of directors elects to increase the number of shares available for future grant by the maximum amount each year, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe are at risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have\nexperienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our recently completed initial public offering and may not use them effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from our recently completed initial public offering. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from our initial public offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from our initial public offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022\ncreating a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us.", "PERMNO": 15177, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SLRX"}
