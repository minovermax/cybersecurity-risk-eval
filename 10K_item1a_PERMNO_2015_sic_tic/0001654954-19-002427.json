The following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results, industry, financial position, or future financial performance.\nOur Results Are Dependent on Our CPG Manufacturing Partners\u2019 Continued Use of Our POPS Solution\nOur financial results are currently largely dependent on the success of our Insignia POPS point-of-purchase in-store marketing solution which is sold primarily to CPG manufacturers. In-Store Signage Solutions represented approximately 79% of our total net sales in 2018. We also continue to have a concentrated CPG customer base for our POPS solution. Our top two CPG customers together accounted for approximately 44% of our total net sales in 2018.\nDuring late 2018, we saw changes in the CPG manufacturers who participate in our solutions that have adversely impacted POPS sales, through CPG manufacturers both forgoing new contracts and reducing forward participation. We also have seen increased competitive activities that are expected to lead to decreased POPS sales. In addition, volatility in CPG manufacturer spend has resulted from shrinking advertising budgets, expanded product solutions, and increased competition.\nShould changes in economic conditions result in reductions in advertising and promotional expenditures by CPG manufacturers that lead to a slower rate of growth or a decrease in spending for the in-store advertising services we offer or we are unable to acquire business from new CPG manufacturers or should any one of the manufacturers who account for a significant amount of our POPS revenues terminate or reduce its participation in the POPS solution, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected due to our heavy dependence on this solution.\nThe Success of Our POPS Solution and Our Results Are Dependent on Our Ongoing Business Relationships with Retailers\nTo execute our POPS solution, we enter into arrangements with retailers that provide us with access to place signs on shelves in their stores for our CPG manufacturing customers. We may also access a portion of our retailer relationships through third parties. During 2018, our top three retailer relationships provided distribution for 31% of our total net sales.\nA significant retailer has notified us of its intent to exit our retailer network in the first half of 2019. Our ability to sell our solutions is substantially dependent on the quantity and quality of the retailer locations in our network. If we are unable secure new retailers that resonate with our CPGs it would have an adverse effect on our In-Store Signage Solutions sales and financial results.\nOur retailer contracts generally have terms of one to three years and we are negotiating the renewal of these contracts on an ongoing basis. The future renewal of these contracts on profitable terms is not free from doubt. For instance, some of our retailer contracts require us to guarantee minimum payments and we may be unable to profitably offer a guarantee at the level required by a retailer during renewal negotiations. The failure to renew a significant retailer arrangement, a decrease in the size or quality of our retail distribution network or if our retailers would fail to continue to maintain our signage solutions in their stores would have an adverse effect on our In-Store Signage Solutions sales and financial results.\nOur Results Are Dependent on The Success of Our Business Relationship with News America\nOur results depend, in part, on the success of our sales and marketing efforts as News America\u2019s exclusive agent for signs with price into the News America network of retailers and upon our ability to successfully sell solutions into this network. Notwithstanding the terms of our agreement with News America, we have had limited success gaining additional access to News America\u2019s retail network and we are facing increased competition for advertising dollars with News America\u2019s other at-shelf advertising and promotional signage offerings. Additionally, if disputes with News America arise in the future regarding the operational aspects of our agreement or if contracts were to end it would allow for increased exclusivity and/or increased competition and could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nWe Face Significant Competition\nWe face significant competition from News America, the primary provider of at-shelf advertising and promotional signage. Although we are party to a contract with News America granting us certain limited rights through February 2021, even as News America\u2019s exclusive agent for signs with price under that contract, we will continue to compete for advertising dollars with News America\u2019s other at-shelf advertising and promotional signage offerings. News America has significantly greater market presence and financial resources that can be used to develop and market their products. Should our competition succeed in obtaining more of the at-shelf advertising business from our current CPG manufacturers, or develop or extend exclusive relationships with our partners, our revenues and related operations would be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, Insignia competes against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, and providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store solutions, as well as other marketing products and services. Competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, store coverage and other factors. The increasing popularity of digital media among consumers is driving a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional in-store tactics to digital. The development of new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. The range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for in-store advertising. As a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure.\nOur Growth Is Dependent on Our Ability to Successfully Introduce New Solution Offerings that Meet Customer Demands and the Ability to Secure and Maintain Relationships with Retailers that Resonate with CPG Manufacturers\nOur ability to retain, increase and engage our customers and to increase our revenues will depend partially on our ability to create successful new products and the ability to secure and maintain access to retailer locations that are appealing to CPG manufacturers. We may modify our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products, including acquired products. If new or enhanced products fail to engage consumers, we may fail to attract or retain customers or to generate sufficient revenues, margins, or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected. In the future, we may invest in new products and initiatives to generate revenue, but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful. If we are unable to gain retailer approval for new products we may be unable to grow revenues from new products. If we are not successful with these new approaches, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenues or recover any associated product development costs, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe May be Subject to Major Litigation\nThe Company continually monitors the competitive practices of those in our industry for fairness which may lead to disputes that could have adverse effects on our Company. We were involved in major litigation with News America between 2003 and 2011. In 2011, the Company and News America entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the antitrust and false advertising lawsuit that had been outstanding for several years. Although the Company obtained a significant settlement in 2011, if future disputes with News America, or other companies arise, it could have an adverse effect on our Company.\nOur Customers May Be Affected by Changes in Economic Conditions\nOur revenues are affected by CPG manufacturers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 marketing and advertising spending and our revenues and results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions inclusive of the dynamic global trade environment. Another economic downturn may reduce demand for our products and services or depress pricing of those products and services and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Retailers may be impacted by changes in consumer spending as well, which may adversely impact our ability to renew contracts with our existing retailers as well as contract with new retailers on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.\nOur Ability to Attract and Retain Key Employees Is Critical to Our Success\nGiven the unique business we operate and the importance of customer relationships to our business, our future success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, operational and sales personnel. Competition for talented personnel is intense, and we cannot be certain that we can retain our managerial, operational and sales personnel or that we can attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. Our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Results of Operations Have Been and May Be Subject to Significant Fluctuations\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary in the future due to a wide variety of factors including:\n\u25cf\nthe addition or loss of contracts with retailers;\n\u25cf\nthe addition or loss of customers or changes in timing and amount of our customers\u2019 spending with us;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of seasonal events for customers;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of new retail stores being added or removed;\n\u25cf\ncosts of evaluating and developing new products, and customers accepting new products;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of additional selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses; and\n\u25cf\ncompetitive conditions in our industry.\nDue to these factors, our quarterly and annual net sales, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future and this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nInvestment in Our Stock Could Result in Fluctuating Returns\nDuring 2018, the sale prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from a low of $1.13 to a high of $2.40. We believe factors such as the fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results described above, the market\u2019s acceptance of our services and products, the performance of our business relative to market expectations, as well as limited daily trading volume of our stock and general volatility in the securities markets, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations, resulting in changes in the market prices of the stock of many companies, which may not have been directly related to the operating performance of those companies.\nThe Company May be Impacted if its Information Systems Are Attacked\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Insignia and its employees, customers, retailer network and suppliers. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats-from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data-are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and products and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain. Establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs. Should such an attack succeed, it could expose us and our employees, customers, retailer network and suppliers to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, theft of assets, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions, and breach of privacy, which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nOur IT Operating Infrastructure Project May Not Function as Anticipated\nWe expect to implement in early 2019 a portion of the new IT operating infrastructure system, while relying on portions of the legacy system. This implementation may not function as designed and tested. If it does not function as designed, it could lead to a material impairment of the capitalized software cost. In addition, additional technology initiatives may be needed to support the Company\u2019s new solution initiatives.", "PERMNO": 76934, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "ISIG"}
