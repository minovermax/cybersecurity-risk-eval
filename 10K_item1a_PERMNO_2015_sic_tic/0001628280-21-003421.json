I Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial position and results of operations. The risks that we have highlighted in the following section of this report are not the only ones that we face.\nOur business involves various risks and uncertainties which are based on the lines of business we write as well as more global risks associated with the general business and insurance industry environments.\nFurther, to the effects of COVID-19 and resulting disruptions on our business and operations as discussed in Item 7 of this report and in the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from COVID-19 and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of the risk factors discussed below.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions, Market Conditions and Investments\nVolatile financial markets and adverse economic environments can affect financial market risk as well as our financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial markets in the U.S. and elsewhere can experience extreme volatility and disruption for uncertain periods of time. During such times, stresses affecting the global banking system can lead to economic volatility, which can exert significant downward pressure on prices of equity securities and many other investment asset classes and result in severely constrained credit and capital markets, particularly for financial institutions, and an overall loss of investor confidence. Many states and local governments can also be impacted by adverse economic conditions, which could have an impact on both our niche market and our investment portfolio. Like other financial institutions that face significant financial market risk in their operations, we have been adversely affected by these conditions and could be adversely impacted by similar circumstances in the future. Our ability to access the capital markets to refinance outstanding indebtedness or raise capital could be impaired during significant financial market disruptions.\nAs discussed further in subsequent risk factors, in addition to the effects of financial markets volatility, a prolonged economic recession may have other adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our investment strategy is not successful, we could suffer unexpected losses.\nThe success of our investment strategy is crucial to the success of our business. Specifically, our fixed maturity securities portfolio is subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022interest rate risk, which is the risk that interest rates will decline and funds reinvested will earn less than expected;\n\u2022market value risk, which is the risk that invested assets will decrease in value due to changes in yields realized on the assets and prevailing market yields for similar assets, an unfavorable change in the liquidity of the asset or an unfavorable change in the financial prospects or a downgrade in the credit rating of the issuer of the asset;\n\u2022credit risk, which is the risk that the value of certain investments become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of those instruments or the deterioration in performance or credit quality of the underlying collateral of certain structured securities and, ultimately, the risk of permanent loss in the event of default by an issuer or underlying credit;\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K 19\n\u2022market fundamentals risk, which is the risk that there are changes in the market that can have an unfavorable impact on securities valuation such as availability of credit in the capital markets, re-pricing of credit risk, reduced market liquidity due to broker-dealers' unwillingness to hold inventory, and increased market volatility;\n\u2022concentration risk, which is the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of deterioration in the financial condition of those issuers or the market value of their securities;\n\u2022liquidity risk, which is the risk that liabilities are surrendered or mature sooner than anticipated requiring the sale of assets at an undesirable time to provide for policyholder surrenders, withdrawals or claims; and,\n\u2022regulatory risk, which is the risk that regulatory bodies or governments, in the U.S. or in other countries, may make substantial investments or take significant ownership positions in, or ultimately nationalize, financial institutions or other issuers of securities held in our investment portfolio, which could adversely impact the seniority or contractual terms of the securities. Regulatory risk could also come from changes in tax laws or bankruptcy laws that could adversely impact the valuation and/or after tax yields of certain invested assets.\nAlthough our defined benefit pension plan has been frozen since 2002, declining financial markets could also cause, and in the past have caused, the value of the investments in this plan to decrease, resulting in additional pension expense, a reduction in other comprehensive income and an increase in required contributions to this plan, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe determination of fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio includes methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe determination of fair value is made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. The use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of market disruption, including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. In such cases, fair value determination may require more subjectivity and management judgment and those fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments could ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in fair value could vary significantly. The difference between fair value and amortized cost, net of applicable deferred income taxes and the related impact on DAC associated with annuity contracts and life insurance products with account values is reflected as a component of AOCI within shareholders' equity. Decreases in the fair value of investments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEquity method adjustments on certain investments in limited partnership interests as well as fair value accounting for equity securities and derivatives may reduce profitability and/or cause volatility in our results of operations.\nWe invest in limited partnership interests, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. This means that our proportionate share of the changes in fair value of the underlying net asset values are reported in net investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result, the amount of net investment income recognized from these investments can vary substantially from period to period. Equity and credit market volatility may reduce net investment income from these types of investments and negatively impact the results of operations. Changes in fair value from applying fair value accounting to equity securities, which are reported in net investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, may cause volatility in our results of operations.\n20 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation\nThe application of fair value accounting for derivatives and embedded derivatives in FIA and IUL products may cause volatility in our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Property and Casualty Segment\nCatastrophe events, as well as significant weather events not designated as catastrophes, can have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnderwriting results of property and casualty insurers are subject to weather and other conditions prevailing in an accident year. While one year may be relatively free of major weather or other disasters - not all of which are designated by the insurance industry as a catastrophe, another year may have numerous such events causing results for such a year to be materially worse than for previous years.\nOur Property and Casualty insurance subsidiaries have experienced, and we anticipate that in the future they will continue to experience, catastrophe losses. A catastrophe event, a series of multiple catastrophe events or a series of non-catastrophe severe weather events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries.\nVarious events can cause catastrophes, including hurricanes, windstorms, hail, severe winter weather, wildfires, earthquakes, explosions and terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty lines, most of the catastrophe-related claims of our insurance subsidiaries are related to property coverages. Our ability to provide accurate estimates of ultimate catastrophe losses is based on several factors, including:\n\u2022the proximity of the catastrophe occurrence date to the date of our estimate;\n\u2022potential inflation of property repair costs in the affected area;\n\u2022the occurrence of multiple catastrophes in a geographic area over a relatively short period of time; and\n\u2022the outcome of litigation which may be filed against us by policyholders, state attorneys general and other parties relative to loss coverage disputes and loss settlement payments.\nBased on 2020 direct premiums earned, 57.5% of the total annual premiums for our Property and Casualty business were for policies issued in the ten largest states in which the insurance subsidiaries write property and casualty coverage. Included in this top ten group are certain states which are considered to be more prone to catastrophe occurrences: California, Texas, North Carolina, Minnesota, South Carolina, Louisiana and Colorado.\nClimate change may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change presents risk to us and there are concerns that the increased frequency and severity of weather-related catastrophes and other losses is indicative of changing weather patterns, whether as a result of climate-warming trends (global climate change) caused by human activities or otherwise, which could cause such events to persist. Increased weather-related catastrophes could lead to higher overall losses, which we may not be able to recoup, particularly in a highly regulated and competitive environment, and higher reinsurance costs. Certain catastrophe models assume an increase in frequency and severity of certain weather or other events, which could result in a disproportionate impact on insurers with certain geographic concentrations of risk. This could also likely increase the risks of writing property insurance in coastal areas or areas susceptible to wildfires or flooding, particularly in jurisdictions that restrict pricing and underwriting flexibility. The threat of rising sea levels or other catastrophe losses as a result of global climate change may also cause property values in coastal or such other communities to decrease, reducing the total amount of insurance coverage that is required.\nIn addition, global climate change could have an impact on our fixed maturity security and limited partnership portfolios, resulting in realized and unrealized losses in future periods that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. It is not possible to foresee which, if any, assets, industries or markets may be materially and adversely affected, nor is it possible to foresee the magnitude of such effect. Further, it is also possible that the legal, regulatory and social responses to climate change could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K 21\nOur property and casualty loss reserves may not be adequate.\nOur Property and Casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain loss reserves to provide for their estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each reporting date. If these loss reserves prove inadequate, a loss is recognized and measured by the amount of the shortfall and, as a result, the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance subsidiaries may be adversely affected, potentially affecting their ability to distribute cash to us.\nReserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Reserves represent estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what the insurance subsidiaries expect the ultimate settlement and adjustment of claims will cost, net of salvage and subrogation. Estimates are based on assessments of known facts and circumstances, assumptions related to the ultimate cost to settle such claims, estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency, changing judicial theories of liability, and other factors. These variables are affected by both internal and external events, including changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, unpredictability of court decisions, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, risks inherent in major litigation and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Significant reporting lags may exist between the occurrence of an insured event and the time it is actually reported. Our insurance subsidiaries adjust their reserve estimates regularly as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, we cannot be certain that the ultimate liability will not exceed amounts reserved, with a resulting adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Supplemental Segment\nActual experience may differ from actuarial assumptions, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nHistorical results may not be indicative of future performance due to, among other things, changes in our mix of business, regulatory actions or changes in legal doctrine impacting our products or lines of business, or any number of economic cyclical effects. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of future benefit liabilities but are instead actuarial and statistical-based estimates. Actual experience may differ from our reserve assumptions. There are no assurances that reserves will be sufficient to fund our future liabilities in all scenarios. Future loss development may require reserves to be increased, which could adversely affect earnings in current and future periods. Adjustments to reserve amounts may be required in the event of changes from the assumptions regarding future morbidity, mortality, persistency, and interest rates used in calculating the reserve amounts, which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Life and Retirement Segments\nA sustained period of low interest rates or interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect net interest margin derived from the difference between interest earned on investments and interest paid under fixed annuity and life insurance products with account values.\nSignificant changes in interest rates expose us to the risk of not earning the appropriate level of income or experiencing losses based on the differences between the interest earned on investments and the credited interest paid on outstanding fixed annuity and life insurance products with account values. Significant changes in interest rates may affect:\n\u2022the ability to maintain appropriate interest rate spreads over the rates guaranteed in fixed annuity and life products with account values;\n\u2022the book yield of the investment portfolio; and\n\u2022the net unrealized investment gains (losses) in the portfolio and the related after tax effect on shareholders' equity and total capital.\nBoth rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect the income derived from interest rate spreads on annuity and life insurance products with account values. During periods of falling interest rates or a sustained\n22 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation\nperiod of low interest rates, investment earnings will be lower because new investments in fixed maturity securities likely will bear lower interest rates. We may not be able to fully offset the decline in investment earnings with lower crediting rates on fixed annuity products, particularly in a multi-year period of low interest rates. As of the time of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, yields on new investments remain at historically low levels. If interest rates do remain low over an extended period of time, it could pressure investment income by having to invest insurance cash flows and reinvest the cash flows from the investment portfolio in lower yielding securities.\nDuring periods of rising interest rates, there may be competitive pressure to increase the crediting rates on fixed annuity products. We may not, however, immediately have the ability to acquire investments with interest rates sufficient to offset an increase in crediting rates under fixed annuity products. Therefore, changes in interest rates could affect interest rate spreads.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect business in other ways. For example, a rapidly changing interest rate environment may result in less competitive crediting rates on certain fixed rate products which could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and/or increases in the level of life insurance and fixed annuity product surrenders and withdrawals. New business volume also could be negatively impacted by product or agent compensation changes which we might make to mitigate the income effect of spread compression. Interest rate fluctuations that impact future profits may also impact DAC amortization.\nThe Retirement business may be, and in the past has been, adversely affected by volatile or declining financial market conditions.\nConditions in the U.S. and international financial markets affect the sale and profitability of retirement products. In general, sales of fee-based products decrease when financial markets are declining or experiencing a higher than normal level of volatility over an extended period of time. Therefore, weak and/or volatile financial market performance may adversely affect sales of fee-based products to potential customers, may cause current customers to withdraw or reduce the amounts invested in fee-based products and may reduce the market value of existing customers' investments in fee-based products, in turn reducing the amount of fee-based product revenues generated. In addition, some variable annuity products offer guaranteed minimum death benefit features, which provide for a benefit if the contractholder dies and the contract value is less than a specified amount. A decline in the financial markets could cause the contract value to fall below this specified amount, increasing exposure to losses from variable annuity products featuring guaranteed minimum death benefits. Declining or volatile financial markets that impact future profits may also impact DAC amortization.\nDeviations from assumptions regarding future market appreciation, interest spreads, business persistency, mortality and morbidity used in calculating life and annuity reserves and DAC amortization could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe processes of calculating reserves and DAC amortization for the life and annuity businesses involve the use of a number of assumptions, including those related to market appreciation (the rate of growth in market value of the underlying variable annuity sub-accounts due to price appreciation), interest spreads (the interest rates expected to be received on investments less the rate of interest credited to contractholders), business persistency (how long a contract stays with us), mortality (the relative incidence of death over a given period of time) and morbidity (the relative incidence of disability resulting from disease or physical impairment). We periodically review the adequacy of these reserves and DAC recoverability on an aggregate basis and, if future experience is estimated to differ significantly from previous assumptions, adjustments to reserves and DAC amortization may be required that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA reduction or elimination of the tax advantages of retirement and life products and/or a change in the tax benefits of various government-authorized retirement programs, such as 403(b) products and individual retirement accounts (IRAs), could make our products less attractive to clients and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant part of our retirement business involves fixed and variable 403(b) tax-qualified products, which are purchased voluntarily by individuals employed by public school systems or other tax-exempt organizations. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that affect the relative tax and other advantages of our life and retirement products to clients or\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K 23\nthe tax benefits of programs utilized by our customers. As a result of persisting economic conditions, revenue challenges exist at federal, state and local government levels. These challenges could increase the risk of future adverse impacts on current tax-advantaged products or result in notable reforms to educator pension programs. Also, see Part I - Item 1, Regulation of this report.\nCurrent federal income tax laws generally permit the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by holders of retirement and life insurance products. Taxes, if any, are generally payable on income attributable to a distribution under the contract for the year in which the distribution is made. From time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of such deferral of taxation on the accretion of value within life insurance and non-qualified annuity contracts. Enactment of this legislation, or other tax reform efforts could result in fewer sales of life insurance and retirement products.\nStrategic Risks\nLack of successful execution on acquisition integration strategies could result in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe accounted for the NTA and BCG acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized on our consolidated balance sheet at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date, including recognition of intangible assets. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets is recognized as goodwill.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected goodwill of $24.1 million and intangible assets of $158.5 million recognized in connection with the NTA and BCG acquisitions (see Part II - Item 8, Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). To the extent the acquisitions do not provide the modeled returns, the value of goodwill or intangible assets could become impaired and thus, we may be required to recognize material non-cash charges relating to such impairment, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe personal lines insurance and retirement markets are highly competitive and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by competitive forces.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and compete with numerous insurance companies, as well as mutual fund families, independent agent companies and financial planners. In some instances and geographic locations, competitors have specifically targeted the educator marketplace with specialized products and programs. We compete in our target market with a number of national providers of personal automobile and property insurance and life insurance and retirement products.\nThe insurance industry consists of a large number of insurance companies, some of which have substantially greater financial resources, more diversified product lines, more sophisticated product pricing, greater economies of scale and/or lower-cost marketing approaches compared to us. In our target market, we believe that the principal competitive factors in the sale of property and casualty insurance products and supplemental insurance products are overall service, worksite sales and service, price, and name recognition. We believe that for our market, the principal competitive factors in the sale of retirement products and life insurance products are worksite sales and service, product features, perceived stability of the insurer, price, overall service and name recognition.\nParticularly in the Property and Casualty business, our insurance subsidiaries have experienced pricing and profitability cycles. During these periods of intense competition, they may be unable to add policyholders and increase revenues without adversely impacting profit margins. With respect to these cycles, the factors having the greatest impact include significant and/or rapid changes in loss costs, including changes in loss frequency and/or severity, prior approval and restrictions in certain states for price increases, intense price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards, aggressive marketing, and increased advertising, which have resulted in higher industry-wide combined loss and expense ratios. During the current cycle, and potentially beyond, competition from direct writers and large, mass market carriers has been particularly aggressive, evidenced in part by their significant national advertising expenditures. In addition, advancements in vehicle technology and safety features, such as accident prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles - once widely available and utilized, as well as expanded availability of usage-based insurance, could materially alter the way that automobile insurance is marketed, priced and underwritten. The\n24 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation\ninability of our insurance subsidiaries to effectively anticipate the impact of these issues on our business and compete successfully in the property and casualty business could adversely affect their financial condition and results of operations and the resulting ability to distribute cash to us.\nIn the Retirement business, there are several factors driving increased competition. First, the current IRS Section 403(b) regulations have made the 403(b) market similar to the 401(k) market. These changes have increased and could continue to increase the number of competitors in the 403(b) market, as it has become more attractive to some of the larger companies experienced in 401(k) plans, including both insurance and mutual fund companies, that had not previously been active competitors in this business. Further, while not yet widespread, there has been continued pressure in some states to adopt state-sponsored or mandated 403(b) plans with single-provider or limited-provider options; this pressure has come from competitor lobbying efforts and state legislature pension reform initiatives. The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to compete successfully in these circumstances could adversely affect their financial condition and results of operations and the resulting ability to distribute cash to us.\nIf we are not able to effectively develop and expand our marketing operations, including agents and other points of distribution, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur agencies are owned primarily by non-employee, independent contractor Exclusive Distributors with most agencies operating in outside offices with licensed producers. The economic viability of each agency is directly dependent on the productivity of the agency and the success at penetrating, serving and cross-selling our educator market.\nOur success in marketing and selling our products is largely dependent upon the efforts of our agent sales force and the success of their agency operations. As we expand our business, we may need to expand the number of agencies marketing our products. If we are unable to appoint additional agents, fail to retain high-producing agents, are unable to maintain the productivity of those agency operations or are unable to maintain market penetration in existing territories, sales of our products could likely decline and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to maintain secure access to educators, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to successfully increase new business in the educator market is largely dependent on our ability to effectively access educators either in their school buildings or through other approaches. While this is especially true for the sale of 403(b) tax-qualified retirement products via payroll deduction, any significant decrease in access, either through fewer payroll slots, increased security measures, impacts of state or federal level pension reform initiatives, requirements of national and state Do Not Call registries, or for other reasons, could adversely affect the sale of all lines of business and require us to change our traditional approach to worksite marketing and promotion, as well as contact with potential customers. With the current IRS regulations regarding Section 403(b) arrangements, including retirement products, our ability to maintain and increase our share of the 403(b) market, and the access it gives for other product lines, will depend on our ability to successfully compete in this market. Some school districts and benefit consultants have placed emphasis on the relative financial strength ratings of competing companies, as well as low cost product and distribution approaches, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other more highly-rated insurance companies.\nOur ability to maintain and obtain product and corporate endorsements from, and/or marketing agreements with, local, state and national education-related associations is important to our marketing strategy. In addition to teacher organizations, we have established relationships with various other educator, principal, school administrator and school business official groups. These contacts and endorsements help to establish our brand name and presence in the educational community and to enhance access to educators.\nOperational Risks\nA large-scale pandemic, the occurrence of terrorism or military actions may have an adverse effect on our business.\nA large-scale pandemic, the occurrence of terrorism or military and other actions, may result in loss of life, property damage, and disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K 25\ninvestment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets, changes in interest rates, reduced liquidity and economic activity caused by a large-scale pandemic. Additionally, a large-scale pandemic or terrorist act could have a material effect on sales, liquidity and operating results.\nFurther, the global pandemic caused by COVID-19 that was initially reported in December 2019 has developed into a worldwide crisis over subsequent months and is causing significant human suffering as well as widespread economic damage. The effects of the outbreak on the U.S. economy, our customers, our agents, our employees, our investments and our communities, as well as any preventative or protective actions that we, our employees and agency force, our third-party service providers and suppliers, or governments may take to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business and on our financial condition and results of operations. Impacts to our business have been and could continue to be widespread and may result in the following:\n\u2022employees contracting COVID-19;\n\u2022reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home;\n\u2022sustained lack of access to schools and educators that could materially impact our sales and premium volumes;\n\u2022public school systems facing budget constraints due to the economic impacts of the pandemic that could result in educator layoffs;\n\u2022unprecedented volatility in financial markets that could materially affect our investment portfolio valuations and returns as well as our ability to generate targeted spreads on indexed products;\n\u2022regulatory mandates and/or legislative changes, including premium grace periods and premium credits;\n\u2022changes in frequency and/or severity of claims;\n\u2022increased credit risk;\n\u2022business disruption for insurance agents who market and sell our insurance products; and\n\u2022business disruptions to third parties at which we outsource certain business functions to or on which we rely for technology.\nThe full extent to which COVID-19 could affect the global economy, the financial markets and our business, our financial condition and our results of operations will depend on future developments and factors that cannot be predicted.\nData security breaches or denial of service on our websites could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nUnauthorized access to and unintentional dissemination of our confidential, highly-sensitive customer, employee or company data or other breaches of data security in our facilities, networks or databases, or those of our agents or third-party vendors - including information technology and software vendors, could result in loss or theft of assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption that may expose us to liability and/or regulatory action and may have an adverse impact on our customers, employees, investors, reputation and business. In addition, any compromise of the security of company data or prolonged denial of service on our websites could harm our business and reputation. Additionally, we recognize the increased external threats of data breaches in the marketplace resulting in non-public data of customers becoming increasingly available in the public domain.\nSuccessful execution of our business growth strategy is dependent on effective implementation of new or enhanced technology systems and applications.\nOur ability to effectively execute our business growth strategy and leverage potential economies of scale is dependent on our ability to provide the requisite technology components for that strategy. While we have effectively upgraded our infrastructure technologies with improvements in our data center, a new communications platform and enhancements to our disaster recovery capabilities, our ability to replace or supplement dated, monolithic legacy business systems - such as our Life, Retirement and Property and\n26 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation\nCasualty policy administrative systems - with more flexible, maintainable, and customer accessible solutions will be necessary to achieve our plans. The inherent difficulty in replacing and/or modernizing these older technologies, coupled with our limited experience in these endeavors, presents an increased risk of failing to deliver these technology solutions in a cost effective and timely manner. Our scale will require us to develop innovative solutions to address these challenges, including consideration of \"software as a service\" arrangements and other third-party based information technology capabilities. More modern approaches to software development and utilization of third-party vendors can augment our internal capacity for these implementations, but may not adequately reduce the operational risks of timely and cost effective delivery.\nLoss of key vendor relationships could affect our operations.\nWe increasingly rely on services and products provided by a number of vendors in the U.S. and abroad. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware and software, including on-demand software, and vendors of services such as investment management advisement, information technology services - such as those associated with the Life, Retirement and Property and Casualty policy administrative systems - and delivery services for customer policy-level communications. In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, we may suffer operational difficulties and financial losses.\nOur ability to attract, develop, and retain talent to maintain appropriate staffing levels, and establish a successful work culture is critical to our success.\nCompetition from within the insurance industry and from other industries, including the technology sector, for qualified employees with highly specialized knowledge in areas such as underwriting, data and analytics, technology and e-commerce, has often been intense and we have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees.\nFactors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include:\n\u2022Compensation and benefits\n\u2022Training and re-skilling programs\n\u2022Reputation as a successful business with a culture of fair hiring, and of training and promoting qualified employees\n\u2022Recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect employees\nThe unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our products and offerings and years of industry experience and, in some cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nFinancial Strength, Credit and Counterparty Risks\nLosses due to defaults by others could reduce our profitability or negatively affect the value of our investments.\nThird-party debtors may not pay or perform their obligations. These parties may include the issuers whose securities we hold, customers, reinsurers, borrowers under mortgage loans, trading counterparties, derivative counterparties, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, operational failure or other reasons.\nDuring or following an economic downturn, our municipal bond portfolio could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue. States are currently barred from seeking protection in federal bankruptcy court. However, federal legislation could possibly be enacted to allow states to declare bankruptcy in connection with deficit reductions or mounting unfunded pension liabilities, which could adversely impact the value of our municipal bond portfolio.\nThe default of a major market participant could disrupt the securities markets or clearance and settlement systems in the U.S. or abroad. A failure of a major market participant could cause some clearance and\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K 27\nsettlement systems to assess members of that system, including our broker-dealer and Registered Investment Adviser regulatory entities, or could lead to a chain of defaults that could adversely affect us. A default of a major market participant could disrupt various markets, which could in turn cause market declines or volatility and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nUncollectible reinsurance, as well as reinsurance availability and pricing, can have a material adverse effect on our business volume and profitability.\nReinsurance is a contract by which one insurer, called a reinsurer, agrees to cover a portion of the losses incurred by a second insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the second insurer. Although a reinsurer is liable to our insurance subsidiaries according to the terms of the reinsurance policy, the insurance subsidiaries remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. As a result, reinsurance does not eliminate the obligation of our insurance subsidiaries to pay all claims, and each insurance subsidiary is subject to the risk that one or more of its reinsurers will be unable or unwilling to honor its obligations.\nAlthough we limit participation in our reinsurance programs to reinsurers with high financial strength ratings and also limit the amount of coverage from each reinsurer, our insurance subsidiaries cannot guarantee that their reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all. Reinsurers may become financially unsound by the time that they are called upon to pay amounts due, which may not occur for many years.\nAdditionally, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions beyond our control. For example, significant losses from hurricanes or terrorist attacks, an increase in capital requirements, or a future lapse of the provisions of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act could have a significant adverse effect on the reinsurance market.\nIf one of our insurance subsidiaries is unable to obtain adequate reinsurance at reasonable rates, that insurance subsidiary would have to increase its risk exposure and/or reduce the level of its underwriting commitments, which could have a material adverse effect upon the business volume and profitability of the subsidiary. Alternatively, the insurance subsidiary could elect to pay the higher than reasonable rates for reinsurance coverage, which could have a material adverse effect upon its profitability until policy premium rates could be raised, in some cases subject to approval by state regulators, to incorporate this additional cost.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties, including reinsurers who reinsure business from our insurance companies.\nOur insurance subsidiaries may cede certain risks to third-party insurance companies through reinsurance. HMLIC entered into a reinsurance agreement with RGA to effectuate the reinsurance of a block of in force fixed and variable annuities on a coinsurance and modified coinsurance basis. The variable portion of the reinsured annuities is reinsured on a modified coinsurance basis and assets supporting the variable account liabilities are still held in separate accounts. Because the reinsurance agreement covers a large volume of our in force annuity business, the transaction exposes us to a concentration of credit risk with respect to this counterparty. RGA's financial obligations for the general account liabilities of the reinsured annuity contracts are secured by its assets placed in a comfort trust for our sole use and benefit. Upon RGA's material breach of the reinsurance agreement, deterioration of its risk-based capital ratio to a certain level, or certain other events, we may recapture the reinsured business. However, in the event of RGA's insolvency, our right to use the assets in the trust account may be delayed. Also, if at the time of its insolvency the trust account is not funded at a level to fully discharge all its obligations, our claims to the extent not covered by the assets in the trust would be those of a general creditor.\nAny downgrade in or adverse change in outlook for our claims-paying ratings, financial strength ratings or credit ratings could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims-paying ratings and financial strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. In the evolving 403(b) retirement market, school districts and benefit consultants have placed an emphasis on the relative financial strength ratings of competing companies. Each rating agency reviews its ratings periodically and from time to time may modify its rating criteria including, among other factors, its expectations regarding capital adequacy, profitability and revenue growth. A downgrade in the ratings or adverse change in the ratings outlook of any of our insurance subsidiaries by a major rating agency could result in substantial loss of business for that subsidiary if school districts, policyholders or independent agents move their business to other companies having higher claims-paying ratings and financial\n28 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation\nstrength ratings than we have. This loss of business could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of that subsidiary.\nA downgrade of our debt rating also could adversely affect our cost and flexibility of borrowing, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn inability to access Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny changes in requirements to retain membership in the FHLB, or changes in regulation, could impact our eligibility for continued FHLB membership or our FHLB funding capacity. Any event that adversely affects amounts received from FHLB could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part II - Item 7, Financing Activities of this report for more information about FHLB activities.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nThe results of the recent U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections may create significant changes in tax rates, laws or regulations which could adversely impact our financial results.\nWith the change in administration, there are initiatives at the federal level to reverse the corporate tax cuts in the favorable Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), increasing the federal corporate income tax from the current rate of 21%. Any future legislative action could increase our costs, the impact of which could be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals as they relate to our businesses. For example, any proposals to make changes related to U.S. tax law, such as those involving a reduction or elimination of the tax advantages of retirement and life products as noted in Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors, Risks Related to Life and Retirement Segments of this report, may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nThe insurance industry is highly regulated.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Each jurisdiction has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. Furthermore, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. Regulation generally is designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to stockholders and non-policyholder creditors. Such regulations, among other things, impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments our insurance subsidiaries may hold. Certain states also regulate the rates insurers may charge for certain property and casualty products. Legislation and voter initiatives have expanded, in some instances, the states' regulation of rates and have increased data reporting requirements. Consumer-related pressures to roll back rates, even if not enacted by legislation or upheld upon judicial appeal, may affect our ability to obtain timely rate increases or operate at desired levels of profitability. Changes in insurance regulations, including those affecting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to distribute cash to us and those affecting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to write profitable property and casualty insurance policies in one or more states, may adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance subsidiaries. In addition, consumer privacy requirements may increase our cost of processing business. Our ability to comply with laws and regulations, at a reasonable cost, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success.\nThe NAIC has adopted a system of assessing minimum capital adequacy that is applicable to our insurance subsidiaries. This system, known as risk-based capital, is used to identify companies that may merit further regulatory action by analyzing the adequacy of the insurer's surplus in relation to statutory requirements. Our insurance subsidiaries could be adversely affected by regulations that change statutory surplus and risk-based capital requirements. Insurance companies write business based, in part, upon guidelines including capital ratios considered by the NAIC and various rating agencies. Some of these ratios include risk-based capital ratios for property and casualty insurance companies, supplemental insurance companies and life insurance companies, as well as a ratio of premiums to surplus for property and casualty insurance companies. Risk-based capital ratios measure an insurer's capital adequacy and consider various risks such as underwriting, investment, credit, asset concentration and interest rate. If our insurance subsidiaries cannot maintain profitability in the future or if significant investment valuation losses are incurred, they may be required to draw on their surplus, thereby reducing capital adequacy, in order to pay dividends to us to enable us to meet our financial obligations. As their\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K 29\nsurplus is reduced by the payment of dividends, continuing losses or both, our insurance subsidiaries' ability to write business and maintain acceptable financial strength ratings could also be reduced. This could have a material adverse effect upon the business volume and profitability of the insurance subsidiaries as well as result in increased regulatory scrutiny or action by state regulatory authorities.\nBecause state legislatures remain concerned about the availability and affordability of property and casualty insurance and the protection of policyholders, our insurance subsidiaries expect that they will continue to face efforts by those legislatures to expand regulations to address these concerns. Resulting new legislation could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries.\nIn the event of insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any of our insurance subsidiaries, our creditors and stockholders would have no right to proceed against any such insurance subsidiary or cause the liquidation or bankruptcy of any such insurance subsidiary under federal or state bankruptcy laws. The insurance laws of the domiciliary state would govern such proceedings and the relevant insurance commissioner would act as liquidator or rehabilitator for the insurance subsidiary. Creditors and policyholders of any such insurance subsidiary would be entitled to full payment from the assets of the insurance subsidiary before us, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution.\nThe financial position of our insurance subsidiaries also may be affected by court decisions that expand insurance coverage beyond the intention of the insurer at the time it originally issued an insurance policy.\nDodd-Frank created FIO within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. FIO studies the current insurance regulatory system and is charged with monitoring and providing specific reports on various aspects of the insurance industry. However, FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance. FIO has suggested an expanded federal role in some circumstances. Additional regulations could adversely affect the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, financial condition and results of operations of us, insurers of similar size and/or the insurance industry as a whole.\nRegulatory initiatives, including the enactment of Dodd-Frank, could adversely affect liquidity and volatility of financial markets in which we participate.\nIn response to the credit and financial crisis, U.S. and overseas governmental and regulatory authorities are considering or implementing enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or stabilize the institutions under their supervision. Such measures are leading to stricter regulation of financial institutions. Changes from Dodd-Frank and other U.S. and overseas governmental initiatives have created uncertainty and could continue to adversely impact liquidity and increase volatility of the financial markets in which we participate and, in turn, negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations. The executive branch has requested a review of financial regulations including Dodd-Frank, which may eliminate or mitigate this risk.\nStatutory and regulatory developments could adversely impact our business by increasing costs or making our business less profitable.\nThe costs of running our business and its profitability could be adversely impacted by laws, rules and regulations that affect the business and financial communities, including changes to the interpretation or enforcement of laws governing standards of care applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisors. New laws, rules and regulations, or changes to the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, rules or regulations, could also result in limitations on the products and services we offer or plan to offer to clients, modifications to our current or future business practices, compressed margins, increased capital requirements, and additional costs. For example, in June 2019, the SEC adopted new Regulation Best Interest, which imposes an overarching of conduct that requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to act in the best interest of their retail customers when making securities recommendations and imposes a number of new compliance and disclosure obligations on broker-dealers. Other state legislatures (including Nevada, New Jersey and Massachusetts) have or are considering, statutes that impose fiduciary standards and other obligations on broker-dealers and investment advisers operating in their states. The DOL also recently adopted its final rule regarding ERISA fiduciary investment advice, which focuses on, among other things, the fiduciary status of rollover recommendations made by financial professionals to retirement investors. We expect that these laws, regulations and proposals could negatively impact our business, including by increasing our legal, compliance and information technology costs, and potentially other costs, including greater risks of client lawsuits and enforcement activity by regulators. These changes may also affect the products and services we choose to offer\n30 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation\nto clients, as well as the compensation that we and our financial professionals receive in connection with such products and services, which could adversely impact our ability to recruit and retain key personnel.\nIt is also unclear how and whether other regulators, such as other state securities and insurance regulators may respond to, or enforce elements of, these new laws and regulations, or develop their own similar laws and regulations. The impacts, degree and timing of the effect of these laws and regulations on our business cannot now be anticipated or planned for, and may have further adverse impacts on our products and services, and the results of our operations.\nFurther, the Dodd-Frank Act enacted wide-ranging changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry providing greater oversight of financial industry participants, enhanced public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures, and greater protections to individual consumers and investors. Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to implementing regulations that are yet to be adopted by the applicable regulatory agencies. Compliance with adopted regulations could affect the products and services we choose to offer and would likely result in increased compliance costs.\nOur business costs and profitability may be adversely impacted by current and future rule making and enforcement activity by the various federal, state and other regulatory organizations to which we are subject.\nLitigation may harm our financial strength or reduce our profitability.\nCompanies in the insurance industry have been subject to substantial litigation resulting from claims, disputes and other matters. Most recently, they have faced expensive claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging, among other things, improper sales practices and improper claims settlement procedures. Negotiated settlements of certain such actions have had a material adverse effect on many insurance companies. The resolution of similar future claims against any of our insurance subsidiaries, including the potential adverse effect on our reputation and charges against the earnings of our insurance subsidiaries as a result of legal defense costs, a settlement agreement or an adverse finding or findings against our insurance subsidiaries in such a claim, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries.\nEvents, including those external to our operations, could damage our reputation.\nThere are many events which may harm our reputation, including, but not limited to, those discussed in this Item 1A regarding regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, and cyber or other information security incidents. Any negative public perception, founded or otherwise, can be widely and rapidly shared over social media or other means, and could cause damage to our reputation. Damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our insurance products, reduce our ability to recruit and retain employees, or lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of our operations.\nAs an insurance company, we are paid to accept certain risks. Those who conduct our business, including executive officers and members of management, employees and independent agents, do so in part by making decisions that involve exposing us to risk. These include decisions such as maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline, maintaining effective claims management and customer service performance, managing our investment portfolio, delivering effective technology solutions, complying with established sales practices, executing our capital management strategy, exiting a line of business and/or pursuing strategic growth initiatives, and other decisions. Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks or unintentionally failing to comply with internal policies and practices, there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures will be effective. If our employees and independent agents take excessive risks and/or fail to comply with internal policies and practices, the impact of those events may damage our market position and reputation.\nIndividual states may impose additional cybersecurity regulations, increasing the complexity of compliance.\nOur businesses must comply with regulations to control the privacy of customer, employee and third party data. State and federal regulations regarding data privacy, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, are becoming increasingly more onerous. A misuse or mishandling of confidential or proprietary information could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. Third parties, including third party administrators and cloud-based systems, are also subject to cyber-breaches of confidential information, along with the other risks outlined above, any one of which may result in us incurring substantial remediation costs and other\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K 31\nnegative consequences, including a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.", "PERMNO": 77120, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "HMN"}
