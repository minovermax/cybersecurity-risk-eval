Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our business, financial condition or operating results to be harmed, including risks regarding the following:\n\u25cf we have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future which, together with our limited working capital and unpredictable Rubraca sales, raises substantial doubt about our financial viability and as to whether we will be able to continue as a going concern;\n\u25cf we will require substantial additional funding which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, for a number of reasons, including market conditions, our ability to generate positive data from our clinical studies, and the need for our stockholders to approve an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to issue, and failure to obtain additional funding may impact our ability to continue our development programs and successfully commercialize Rubraca and our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u25cf the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues and our ability to continue to operate our business;\n\u25cf servicing our long-term debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt;\n\u25cf we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to repay our debt upon a fundamental change, and provisions in our debt could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us;\n\u25cf we are highly dependent on revenues from the sale of Rubraca, and the rate and degree of market acceptance and commercial viability, including the safety, efficacy and potency of Rubraca and our other product candidates may limit the commercial success of Rubraca;\n\u25cf if our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for Rubraca or other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval are inadequate, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from sales of our products;\n\u25cf we cannot give any assurance that the Rubraca development program in other lines of therapies and indications will be successful or that our other product candidates will receive regulatory approval;\n\u25cf our expectations regarding the FDA and other regulatory authorities\u2019 interpretation of our data and information on our product candidates and the impact on our business of the FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 interpretation of our submissions, filing decisions by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, potential advisory committee meeting dates and advisory committee recommendations, and FDA and other regulatory authorities product approval decisions and related timelines;\n\u25cf the success of competing drugs that are or become available;\n\u25cf the success and timing of our non-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf our ability to verify the clinical benefit of Rubraca through our confirmatory trials and to satisfy other post-marketing requirements and post-marketing commitments, our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of Rubraca and our other product candidates, and the labeling under Rubraca and any other approval we may obtain;\n\u25cf our ability to engage and retain third-party manufacturers with sufficient capability and capacity to support the commercialization of Rubraca and our other product candidates, and the performance of such third-party manufacturers;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, including our ability to defend our intellectual property against challenges;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain our collaborations with our licensing partners to develop our product candidates;\n\u25cf the size and growth of potential markets for our product candidates and our ability to serve those markets;\n\u25cf the loss of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u25cf regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf our operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of investors or analysts, the trading price of our stock could decline;\n\u25cf the price of our stock has been, and may continue to be volatile, which will impact the value of your investment and our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u25cf future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, including through our equity incentive plans, could result in dilution of your investment and cause our stock price to fall.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 could materially adversely affect our business.\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (the \u201cWHO\u201d) declared that the recent novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern, and on March 11, 2020 the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. This has resulted in increased travel restrictions, quarantines, \u201cwork-at-\nhome\u201d and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and extended shutdown of certain non-essential businesses in the United States, and European and Asia-Pacific countries, including countries in which we commercialize Rubraca and countries in which we have planned or active clinical trials. With a renewed rise in the number of cases of the coronavirus in certain parts of the United States and Europe and the ongoing uncertainty regarding future trends in cases, these restrictions, quarantines, shutdowns and other disruption to businesses globally continue to evolve and, in many areas, increase. The effects of the coronavirus are difficult to assess or predict.\nOur ability to generate product revenue for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2021 was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily due to the ongoing effect the pandemic has had on oncology treatment and practice, and in particular, in ovarian cancer, resulting in fewer diagnoses and fewer patients going to in-person office visits in the U.S. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our U.S. and European sales forces have had physical access to hospitals, clinics, doctors and pharmacies curtailed and/or have been limited. Our European launches occurred in an environment in which our field-based personnel were not allowed to visit hospitals beginning as early as late February 2020. Similarly, we launched Rubraca for prostate cancer in the U.S beginning in May 2020, but our physical access to hospital, clinics, doctors and pharmacies remains limited. It is difficult to discern or predict any trend in new patient starts due to the unpredictability of the COVID-19 situation and the changing competitive landscape.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has had a major impact on the financial markets, the global economy or the economies of particular countries or regions. Specifically, the COVID-19 outbreak could result in reduced operations of third-party manufacturers upon whom we rely, disrupt our supply chain, or otherwise limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials to manufacture Rubraca and our product candidates. While we believe that we have sufficient supply of Rubraca and our product candidates to continue our commercial and clinical operations as planned, Rubraca and our product candidates, or materials contained therein, come from facilities located in areas impacted by COVID-19 or that may be impacted, as the COVID-19 outbreak or its disruption worsens. If any third party in our supply or distribution chain for materials or finished product are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, including staffing shortages, production slowdowns and disruptions in delivery systems, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture and distribute Rubraca for commercial sales and our product candidates for our clinical trials and research and development operations. There is no guarantee that the recent COVID-19, or any potential future, outbreak would not impact our future supply chain, which could have a material adverse impact on our clinical trial plans and business operations.\nOur sales force has had physical access to hospitals, clinics, doctors and pharmacies curtailed and/or has been limited, which may have a material adverse effect on our future sales. While digital tools are available to our field employees to facilitate remote meetings with healthcare providers, we cannot ensure that these methods will be effective. Additionally, patients who might be currently using Rubraca, or might otherwise be eligible to use our products, may be unable to meet with their healthcare providers in-person, which may reduce the number of prescription refills or new patient starts, affecting our revenues from Rubraca both in our currently approved ovarian cancer indications, as well as impacting our current launch in BRCA-mutant metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, which was approved during the second quarter of 2020.\nWe did not see material disruption to our clinical trials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021. However, with the increase in cases of COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant, and the potential for quarantines, unavailability of medical services regarded as non-essential, or reluctance of patients to seek treatment, we may see delays in enrollment during 2022. For example, new patient recruitment in clinical studies, including LuMIERE, may be affected and the conduct of clinical trials may vary by geography as some regions are more adversely affected.\nIn addition, COVID-19 could affect our employees, our agents and their employees or the employees of companies with which we do business, thereby disrupting our business operations. We have implemented work-at-home policies and may experience limitations in employee resources. Our increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business. The effects of working from home and other burdens imposed by COVID-19 on individuals may impact our employee retention. In addition, our reliance on personnel working from home could increase our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations or delay necessary interactions with local and federal regulators, manufacturing sites, research or clinical trial sites and other important agencies and contractors.\nOn March 18, 2020, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (\u201cFFCR Act\u201d), and on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act were each enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FFCR Act and the CARES Act contain numerous income tax provisions, such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed an additional coronavirus relief package entitled the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\u201cARPA\u201d), which included, among other things, provisions relating to stimulus payments to some Americans, extension of several CARES Act relief programs, expansion of the child tax credit, funding for vaccinations and other COVID-19 related assistance programs. The CARES Act, FFCR Act, and the ARPA have not had a material impact on the Company; however, we will continue to examine the impacts that these Acts, as well as any future economic relief legislation, may have on our business.\nThe trading prices for our common stock and of other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result of this volatility and uncertainties regarding the future impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations, we may face difficulties raising capital or may only be able to raise capital on unfavorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the coronavirus could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock. A number of governments in places where we have operations have adopted stimulus programs to assist businesses effected by COVID-19, including by facilitating lending arrangements. We may access these loan programs for additional working capital although there can be no guarantee that we will obtain any such loans and we do not currently know the terms of such loan programs.\nThe effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of COVID-19 could have a material impact on the losses we experience. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which together with our limited working capital raises substantial doubt about our financial viability and as to whether we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditor\u2019s report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes an explanatory paragraph related to the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in April 2009. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had net losses of $264.5 million, $369.2 million and $400.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $2,877.3 million. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a high degree of risk and requires substantial capital investment. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We have limited working capital. We have received regulatory approval to market Rubraca in the U.S. and in Europe, but do not know whether Rubraca will be approved in other jurisdictions or in additional tumor types and indications, or whether it will achieve market acceptance and be commercially successful in the long run. Although we generate revenues from product sales, these revenues have not been sufficient, and may never be sufficient, to support our operations. Rubraca revenues have not been consistent in prior quarters, mainly as a result of the impact of COVID-19 and competition from other products on the market. We expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. We require significant cash resources to execute our business plans and we will need to raise additional cash to continue to fund our operating plan. We expect to finance our operating plan through a combination of public or private equity or debt offerings, collaborations, strategic alliances and other similar licensing arrangements in both the short term and the long term. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, for a number of reasons, including market conditions, our ability to generate positive data from our clinical studies, and the need for our stockholders to approve an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to issue. The aforementioned factors, which are largely outside of our control, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of filing of this annual report. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of\nliabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of filing of this annual report. If we are forced to scale down, restructure, limit or cease operations, our stockholders could lose all of their investment in our Company.\nWe will require substantial additional funding which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing, we will be unable to continue our development programs, fund our operating plan and continue as a going concern.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to advance the clinical development of our products and launch and commercialize our products. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we do not expect in the foreseeable future and which we may never do in sufficient amounts, we expect to finance our operating plan through a combination of public or private equity or debt offerings, collaborations, strategic alliances and other similar licensing arrangements in both the short term and long term. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, our ability to generate positive data from our clinical and pre-clinical studies, the condition of the capital markets and the other risks described in these risk factors. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will not be able to fund our operating plan and may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. We may not be able to continue our operations.\nIn addition, in order to continue to raise capital through the sale of equity securities (or securities convertible into our equity securities), we will need our stockholders, at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, to consider again and to approve a proposal to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to issue. We cannot be certain that our stockholders will approve such a proposal. In the event our stockholders do not approve such a proposal, our ability to raise capital to fund our operations beyond the next 12 months will be significantly limited and we will need to consider potentially more costly sources of funding, potentially through incurring further indebtedness or entering into strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements for one or more of our products or product candidates in which we may have to give up certain of our future commercialization rights for interim funding. We cannot be certain that such other sources of funding will be available to us or on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to meet our requirements and to continue our operations.\nServicing our long-term debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $300.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d), $85.8 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes (2019 Issuance)\u201d), and $57.5 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of a new series of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes (2020 Issuance))\u201d and together with the 2024 Notes and 2025 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d). In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had $147.2 million outstanding aggregate principal amount pursuant to our ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement. We are obligated to begin repaying the ATHENA clinical trial financing on a quarterly basis, beginning on the earliest to occur of (i) the termination of the ATHENA Trial, (ii) the approval by the FDA of an update to the label portion of the Rubraca new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) to include in such label the treatment of an indication resulting from the ATHENA Trial, (iii) the date on which we determine that the results of the ATHENA Trial are insufficient to achieve such an expansion of the Rubraca label to cover an indication based on the ATHENA Trial and (iv) September 30, 2022 (the \u201cRepayment Start Date\u201d).\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on the Notes, to pay the repurchase price for the Notes on a fundamental change or to begin repaying the ATHENA clinical trial financing when due, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may not have sufficient cash in the future to service our debt. If we are unable to generate such cash flow or secure additional sources of funding, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these\nactivities or engage in these activities on desirable terms. If we fail to meet our obligations under the Notes, we will be in default, which may also cause a default under, and an acceleration of, our other debt obligations.\nWe may not be able to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, or the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement upon a change of control, and our future and current debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture, prior to the maturity date of the Notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, in the event of a change of control of us, we must pay to the lenders under the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement, 1.75 times the amount we have borrowed thereunder if the change of control occurs prior to the Repayment Start Date, or 2 times the amount we have borrowed thereunder if the change of control occurs after the Repayment Start Date (minus the amount of all quarterly payments previously paid to the lenders) (the \u201cDischarge Amount\u201d). We may not have or be able to borrow the funds required to repurchase the Notes on the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes may otherwise be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness, including limitations on repurchase of certain debt set forth in the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing other current indebtedness, such as the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement, or our future indebtedness. For example, an event of default under the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement (which includes, among other events, breaches or defaults under or terminations of our material in-license agreements related to Rubraca and defaults under our other material indebtedness), the lenders have the right to declare the Discharge Amount to be immediately due and payable. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes when required.\nWe may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above; and we may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement and any future indebtedness we may incur.\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in any debt instruments that we enter into in the future, some of which may be secured debt, such as the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes or the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement when due. Our ability to refinance the Notes or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, agreements that govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of some or all of our debt.\nProvisions in the indenture and the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.\nCertain provisions in the Notes and the indentures governing the Notes, and in the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement, could make a third-party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then holders will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes, the indentures governing the Notes and the ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that holders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are highly dependent on the commercial success of Rubraca; Rubraca may not achieve market acceptance and may not be commercially successful and we may not attain profitability and positive cash flow from operations.\nRubraca is commercially available in the U.S. and Europe. The degree of market acceptance and the commercial success of Rubraca will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our sales and marketing strategy and operations\u037e\n\u25cf maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to Rubraca and our commercial activities, including the post\u00ad-marketing requirements and post\u00ad-marketing commitments required by the FDA and the EMA, to verify Rubraca\u2019s clinical benefit or safety by completing certain confirmatory trials, pharmacology studies and additional diagnostic development\u037e\n\u25cf the acceptance of Rubraca by patients and the medical community and the availability, perceived advantages and relative cost, safety and efficacy of alternative and competing products and therapies\u037e\n\u25cf the continued acceptable safety profile of Rubraca and the occurrence of any unexpected side effects, adverse reactions or misuse, or any unfavorable publicity in these areas\u037e\n\u25cf the ability of our third\u00ad-party manufacturers to manufacture commercial supplies of Rubraca, to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies, and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are, to the extent required, compliant with cGMP regulations\u037e\n\u25cf the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from managed care plans, private health insurers and other third-party payors and the willingness and ability of patients to pay for Rubraca\u037e\n\u25cf the development or commercialization of competing products or therapies\u037e\n\u25cf marketing and distribution support for Rubraca, including the degree to which the approved labeling supports promotional initiatives for commercial success\u037e\n\u25cf the actual market\u00ad size for Rubraca, which may be different than expected\u037e\n\u25cf our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to Rubraca\u037e\n\u25cf our ability to avoid third party patent interference or patent infringement claims\u037e and\n\u25cf our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, including for pricing and reimbursement, to commercialize Rubraca in markets outside of the U.S. and Europe.\nAs many of these factors are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to grow meaningful revenue through the sale of Rubraca. In addition, we may experience significant fluctuations in sales of Rubraca from period to period. We have two other product candidates, lucitanib and FAP-2286, in clinical development. Any inability on our part to successfully commercialize Rubraca in the United States, Europe and any other territories where it may be approved, or any significant delay in such approvals, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute upon our business strategy and, ultimately, to generate sufficient revenues from Rubraca to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations.\nIf our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for Rubraca or our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval are inadequate, we may be unable to generate revenue from sales of our products.\nPrior to the launch of Rubraca, we had not commercialized any drug products as a company. To achieve commercial success for Rubraca and any product candidate that may be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must continue to maintain or expand our sales, marketing, managerial and other non\u00adtechnical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We are competing with companies that currently have extensive, well\u00ad-funded, and more experienced sales and marketing operations. We may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nWe have built a field organization and other capabilities for the sales, marketing and distribution of Rubraca in the United States and in Europe, and there are significant risks involved with building and managing a sales organization. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to effectively commercialize Rubraca on our own include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit, train, retain and incentivize adequate numbers of qualified and effective sales and marketing personnel\u037e\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to generate sufficient sales leads and to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to use or prescribe Rubraca\u037e and\n\u25cf our inability to effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for Rubraca or if we are unable to fully establish and maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for Rubraca outside of the United States or for any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue or may not become profitable. If the cost of establishing and maintaining a sales and marketing organization exceeds the cost\u00ad-effectiveness of doing so, we may not become profitable.\nWith respect to our product candidates, we may elect to collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems in certain territories. To the extent that we enter into licensing or co-promotion arrangements for any of our product candidates, our product revenue may be lower than if we directly marketed or sold our approved products. In addition, any revenue we receive as a result of such arrangements would depend in whole or in part upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful and are generally not within our control. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates that receive regulatory approval. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer, and we may incur significant additional losses.\nWe cannot give any assurance that the Rubraca development program in other lines of therapies and indications will be successful or that our other product candidates will receive regulatory approval.\nTo date, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the acquisition and development of our product candidates. Our business depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nEach of our product candidates requires clinical development, management of clinical, non-clinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, obtaining manufacturing supply, building of a commercial organization and significant marketing efforts in order to generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. To date, we have received regulatory approval from the FDA and EMA to market Rubraca in the United States and Europe, respectively. We may not receive regulatory approvals for Rubraca for broader indications and lines of therapy or other tumor types and we may never receive regulatory approval for other product candidates. In addition, certain of our product development plans may contemplate the development of companion diagnostics by third-party collaborators. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation as medical devices and must themselves be approved for marketing by the FDA or certain other foreign regulatory agencies before our product candidates may be commercialized.\nWe cannot be certain that Rubraca will be successfully developed to expand its current label to include other indications or that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. Two of our product candidates, CO-101 and rociletinib, encountered development and regulatory setbacks after initial promising data, leading us to discontinue enrollment in ongoing clinical trials. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our other product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, upon our diagnostic collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostics, where required, to be used with our product candidates, as well as the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates, and for other indications for Rubraca, in the United States, Europe and in additional foreign countries. While the scope of regulatory approval is similar in other countries, obtaining separate regulatory approval in many other countries requires compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of non-clinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through non-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. It is not uncommon for companies in the biopharmaceutical industry to suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Indeed, based on the negative results of a pivotal study, we ceased further development of our previous product candidate CO-101, and we decided to discontinue ongoing development of rociletinib as a result of the issuance of a Complete Response Letter by the FDA. Additionally, our future clinical trial results may not be successful.\nAlthough we have clinical trials ongoing, we may experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials, and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u25cf obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u25cf reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf obtaining institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) approval at each site;\n\u25cf recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u25cf developing and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis;\n\u25cf having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25cf adding new clinical trial sites; or\n\u25cf manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Furthermore, we rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations, trial sites or manufacturing sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial\nprospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for Rubraca in other indications and lines of therapy or for our other product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have obtained regulatory approval for Rubraca in the United States and Europe, and it is possible that Rubraca may not obtain regulatory approval for broader indications and lines of therapy or other tumor types or that any of our other existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Indeed, with the issuance of a Complete Response Letter by the FDA with respect to the rociletinib NDA, we decided to discontinue ongoing development of rociletinib.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval or approval may be delayed for many reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u25cf the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from non-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, MAA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the EU or elsewhere;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the companion diagnostics we contemplate developing with partners; and\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThis lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if and when approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing and clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, pricing, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices and good clinical practices for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u25cf restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25cf fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u25cf refusal by the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u25cf product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nAll of the foregoing limitations, obligations, and requirements also apply to Rubraca, for which we have received regulatory approval in the United States and the EU for certain indications.\nWe may seek approval from U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities for one or more product candidates on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, we received accelerated approval from the FDA for the initial indication for Rubraca and conditional marketing authorization from the EMA for the initial indication for Rubraca. Each of these approval pathways has certain conditions to approval, some of which may be post-approval, such as the conduct of a post-approval, or confirmatory, trial using due diligence. If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that are conditions of a product\u2019s accelerated or conditional approval, if the confirmatory trial shows unfavorable results or increased or additional undesirable side effects, or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product candidate, the availability of accelerated or conditional approval may be withdrawn or our conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change a product candidate\u2019s labeled indications or even withdraw the product, if approved, from the market.\nThe FDA\u2019s, EMA\u2019s and comparable foreign authorities\u2019 policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States, the EU or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nRubraca and our other product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nAdverse events (\u201cAEs\u201d) attributable to our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign authorities. Clinical studies conducted to date have generated AEs related to our product candidates, some of which have been serious. Patients treated with Rubraca have commonly experienced nausea, vomiting, constipation, dysgeusia, anemia/decreased hemoglobin, decreased appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia and fatigue/asthenia. In studies of lucitanib, hypertension, proteinuria and subclinical hypothyroidism requiring supplementation are the most common AEs observed. As is the case with all oncology drugs, it is possible that there may be other potentially harmful characteristics associated with their use in future trials, including larger and lengthier Phase III clinical trials. As we evaluate the use of our product candidates in combination with other active agents, we may encounter safety issues as a result of the combined safety profiles of each agent, which could pose a substantial challenge to that development strategy.\nResults of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related AEs could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf sales of such product may decline;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw or restrict approvals of such product;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u25cf we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf additional nonclinical or clinical studies, changes in labeling or changes to manufacturing processes, specifications and/or facilities may be required\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of the above occurrences would harm or prevent sales of such product, prevent us from achieving or maintain market acceptance of a product candidate, increase our expenses and impair our ability to successfully commercialize Rubraca. As Rubraca is commercially available, it may be used in a wider population and in a less rigorously controlled environment than in clinical studies. As a result, regulatory authorities, healthcare practitioners, third-party payors or patients may perceive or conclude that the use of Rubraca is associated with previously unknown serious adverse effects, undermining our commercialization efforts.\nFailure to successfully validate, develop and obtain regulatory approval for companion diagnostics could harm our drug development strategy.\nWhere appropriate in the context of our clinical development strategy, we seek to identify patient subsets within a disease category who may derive selective and meaningful benefit from the product candidates we are developing. In collaboration with partners, we may develop companion diagnostics to help us to more accurately identify patients within a particular subset, both during our clinical trials and in connection with the commercialization of our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We do not develop companion diagnostics internally and thus we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of our third-party collaborators in developing and obtaining approval for these companion diagnostics. We and our collaborators may\nencounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for the companion diagnostics, including issues relating to selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation. Any delay or failure by our collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostics could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates. In addition, our collaborators may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostics, and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostics in the clinical community. If such companion diagnostics fail to gain market acceptance, it would have an adverse effect on our ability to derive revenues from sales of our products. In addition, the diagnostic company with whom we contract may decide to discontinue selling or manufacturing the companion diagnostic that we anticipate using in connection with development and commercialization of our product candidates or our relationship with such diagnostic company may otherwise terminate. We may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain access to an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and/or delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our non-clinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing non-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our non-clinical and clinical studies, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with GCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the EMA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical and non-clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially influence our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely completely on third parties to manufacture our clinical drug supplies and our commercial supplies of Rubraca, and our development and commercialization of any of our product candidates could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to maintain approval of the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of drug product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have nor do we plan to acquire the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our clinical drug supplies for use in the conduct of our clinical trials, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We do not control the manufacturing operations of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the cGMP regulatory requirements for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have limited control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly affect our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nWe rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our products. There are a limited number of suppliers of raw materials that we use to manufacture our drugs, including Chinese suppliers, and there may be a need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the materials necessary to produce our products for clinical trials and for commercial sale. We do not have direct control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any direct agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product or product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer, could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\nWe are dependent on our third-party manufacturers to conduct process development and scale-up work necessary to support greater clinical development and commercialization requirements for our product candidates. Carrying out these activities in a timely manner, and on commercially reasonable terms, is critical to the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. We expect that our third-party manufacturers are capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated clinical and full-scale commercial demands, however if third parties with whom we currently work are unable to meet our supply requirements, we will need to secure alternate suppliers. While we believe that there are other contract manufacturers having the technical capabilities to manufacture our product candidates, we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. It may also take a significant period of time to establish an alternative source of supply for our products, product candidates and components and to have any such new source approved by the FDA or any applicable foreign regulatory authorities.\nWe expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. While we have long-term agreements with Lonza for the manufacture of API for Rubraca and with the manufacturer of the finished drug product, those are our single sources for the supply of Rubraca API and finished drug product, respectively, and we have not entered into agreements with any alternate suppliers. We currently obtain our supplies of finished drug product through individual purchase orders as described in the current supply agreement.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the availability of key raw materials, such as the radioisotopes used in the manufacture of our product candidates.\nThe manufacture of our product candidate 177Lu-FAP-2286 and companion imaging agent 68Ga-FAP-2286 will require the use of raw materials that are subject, at times, to global supply constraints that have the potential to delay our work on the products incorporating those raw materials. For example, any limitation on our ability to source adequate supply of lutetium-177 for 177Lu-FAP-2286 could prevent us from gathering sufficient data in clinical trials, or to the extent that we obtain regulatory approval for marketing for this product candidate, a limited supply may prevent us from\nmeeting commercial demands. Supply constraints for lutetium-177 could also materially increase the manufacturing costs of 177Lu-FAP-2286, which would increase the cost of our clinical trials and reduce the commercial potential of the product candidate.\nIn addition, we plan to use 68Ga in our development of imaging agent 68Ga-FAP-2286. Increased future demand for 68Ga may exceed current production capacities. If we are not able to obtain sufficient quantities of gallium-68 for use in 68Ga-FAP-2286, we may not be able to gather sufficient data on 68Ga-FAP-2286 to use in clinical trials or to possibly seek the approval of 68Ga-FAP-2286. In addition, to the extent the approval of our product candidates depends on the screening and monitoring of the patient population with a companion imaging agent such as 68Ga-FAP-2286 in our clinical trials, we would experience a corresponding delay in approval and commercialization of these product candidates if we are not able to obtain sufficient 68Ga.\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and major operators of cancer clinics.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our other product candidates, the product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, health care payors, patients and the medical community, which are critical to commercial success. Market acceptance of any product candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u25cf the timing of market introduction of such product candidate as well as competitive products;\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which the drug is approved, and the product label approved by regulatory authorities, including any warnings that may be required on the label;\n\u25cf the approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for the companion diagnostic;\n\u25cf acceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer clinics and patients of the drug as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u25cf the potential and perceived advantages of such product candidate over alternative treatments, especially with respect to patient subsets that we are targeting with such product candidate;\n\u25cf the safety of such product candidate seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u25cf the cost, safety and efficacy of the product in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u25cf relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and patients, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, and we may not become or remain profitable.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. In addition, the competition in the oncology market is intense. We have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions (see Part I, Item 1 - Business, Competition section).\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. GlaxoSmithKline plc gained rights to Zejula through its acquisition of Tesaro Inc., which was completed in January 2019. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in\nour competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, drug products that are more effective or less costly than any drug candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop. If approved, our product candidates will face competition from commercially available drugs, as well as drugs that are in the development pipelines of our competitors and later enter the market.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make our product candidates less competitive. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA, European Commission or other regulatory approval or discovering, developing and commercializing medicines before we do, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nReimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. We have received marketing authorization for Rubraca in the United States and the EU for multiple indications. We intend to seek additional approvals to market Rubraca and other product candidates in the United States, Europe and other selected foreign jurisdictions. Market acceptance and sales of our products in both domestic and international markets will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our products and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures. Government and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. These payors may conclude that our products are less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than existing or later introduced products, and third-party payors may not approve our products for coverage and reimbursement or may cease providing coverage and reimbursement for these products.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to the payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our products. Even if we obtain coverage for our products, third-party payors may not establish adequate reimbursement amounts, which may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. The U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform. In particular, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 revised the payment methodology for many products under the Medicare program in the United States. This has resulted in lower rates of reimbursement. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), was enacted. The Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Such government-adopted reform measures may adversely affect the pricing of healthcare products and services in the United States or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third-party payors.\nMoreover, payment methodologies, including payment for companion diagnostics, may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the CMS has begun bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting and, in 2018, the CMS began paying for clinical laboratory services based on a weighted average of reported prices that private payors, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicaid Managed Care plans pay for laboratory services.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Recently there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect the demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, as well as our ability to set satisfactory prices for our products, to generate revenues, and to achieve and maintain profitability.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly in Europe, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our product candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a particular country, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability of our products in such country.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. Further, we will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. Our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel, especially Patrick J. Mahaffy, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Lindsey Rolfe, our Executive Vice President of Clinical Development and Pharmacovigilance and Chief Medical Officer, Gillian C. Ivers-Read, our Executive Vice President, Technical Operations and Chief Regulatory Officer and Dr. Thomas Harding, our Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer whose services are critical to the successful implementation of our product candidate acquisition, development and regulatory strategies.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific, development and commercial teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Pursuant to their employment arrangements, each of our executive officers may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time by providing as little as thirty days advance notice. Our employment arrangements with all of our employees provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or, other than our executive officers, without notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, financial condition and prospects. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level and senior scientific and medical personnel.\nAs of February 17, 2022, we employed 413 employees. As our development plans and strategies develop, we expect to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we have to offer. In order to induce valuable employees to continue their employment with us, we have provided stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time is significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited.\nOur employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors, may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors, may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by those parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent failures to comply with the laws and regulations of the FDA and other similar regulatory agencies, provide accurate information to such authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, including cGMP requirements, comply with federal and state data privacy, securities, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee or contractor misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Ethics and other compliance policies, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and contractors, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant effect on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nOur relationships with healthcare professionals, investigators, consultants, customers (actual and potential) and third-party payors are and will continue to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency and disclosure (or \u201csunshine\u201d) laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. These laws may affect, among other things, our current activities with clinical study investigators and research subjects, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing, disease awareness, and patient assistance programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment will be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or special intent to violate the law in order to have committed a violation; in addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;\n\u25cf federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil \u201cqui tam\u201d or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d actions, against individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from federal programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u25cf the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also imposes certain requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information\u037e\n\u25cf the federal civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s election of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a Federal or state governmental program;\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members\u037e\n\u25cf federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers\u037e\n\u25cf federal government price reporting laws, which require drug manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government agencies, including CMS, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on marketed products. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may result in potentially significant discounts on products subject to reimbursement under federal healthcare programs and increased infrastructure costs, and may potentially limit a drug manufacturer\u2019s ability to offer certain marketplace discounts\u037e and\n\u25cf analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-\u00adkickback, false claims, consumer protection and unfair competition laws which may apply to pharmaceutical business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements as well as submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-\u00adparty payer, including commercial insurers\u037e state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources\u037e state laws that require drug manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities\u037e and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIn addition, the research and development of our product candidates outside the United States, and any sales of our products or product candidates once commercialized outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs, including investments in infrastructure and additional resources. Because of the breadth of these laws and the\nnarrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our consulting agreements and other relationships with physicians, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Governmental and enforcement authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nCompliance with data privacy laws and regulations is complex and could expose us to a variety of risks.\nWe operate in an environment that relies on the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of individuals\u2019 personal information, and that also, in many situations, requires that data to be transferred across borders of numerous countries in which there are different, and potentially conflicting, data privacy laws in effect. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, impose stringent requirements on how we and third parties with whom we contract collect, share, export or otherwise process personal information, and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Breaches of our systems or those of our third-party contractors, or other failures to protect the data we collect from misuse or breach by third parties, could expose such personal information to unauthorized persons.\nAny event involving the substantial loss of personal information or other privacy violations could give rise to significant liability, reputational harm, damaged relationships with business partners, and potentially substantial monetary penalties under laws enacted or being enacted around the world. Such events could also lead to restrictions on our ability to use personal information and/or transfer personal information across country borders.\nOur business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.\nWe are subject to a number of anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act. Our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws applicable to us could result in penalties, which could harm our reputation and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. The FCPA also requires public companies to maintain accurate books and records and devise a system of sufficient internal accounting controls. We regularly review and update our policies and procedures and internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that we, our employees, distributors and other intermediaries comply with the anti-corruption laws to which we are subject. However, there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any policies, procedures and internal controls, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the policies, procedures and internal controls. There can be no assurance that such policies or procedures or internal controls will work effectively at all times or protect us against liability under these or other laws for actions taken by our employees, distributors and other intermediaries with respect to our business.\nThe SEC and the Department of Justice continue to view FCPA enforcement activities as a high priority. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, contractors or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international operations, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such\nproduct liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates, if approved. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for our product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u25cf costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf increase in insurance premiums;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf loss of revenues from product sales;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u25cf a decline in our stock price.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We have a program of product liability insurance covering our ongoing clinical trials; however, the amount of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by our CROs or other vendors, contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nWe and our business partners maintain sensitive company data on our computer networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary business information, as well as certain clinical trial information. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more commonplace and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, including by means of ransomware, social engineering or other means, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, misappropriation of information and corruption of data. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. This includes events where we or our CROs, vendors, contractors or consultants are not targeted but are indirectly impacted by a cyber-attack. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of our workforce is currently working remotely. This could increase our cybersecurity risk, create data accessibility concerns and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and business operations. For example, the loss of, or inability to access, even temporarily, clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Additionally, healthcare providers have become a frequent target of cybersecurity attacks, and if clinical trial sites suffer a disruption as a result of such an attack, their ability to continue to participate in the trial or to provide trial data to us may be impacted. For example, the Ireland Health Service Executive suffered a\nmajor ransomware and extortion attack in May 2021 that impacted the provision of health services across Ireland. While our clinical trials were not delayed or adversely impacted and our data was not compromised, several of our clinical trial sites were impacted by the attack. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our products and product candidates, including clinical trial supply, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business and development programs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, information security policies and contractual obligations relating to privacy and data protection, including the use, processing, and cross-border transfer of personal information. These laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, or monetary penalties, and otherwise may harm our business. We receive, generate and store significant and increasing volumes of sensitive information and business-critical information, including employee and personal data, research and development information, commercial information, and business and financial information. Cyber-attacks, breaches, interruptions or other data security incidents could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under federal or state laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, significant remediation costs, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. In the United States and Europe, notice of breaches of personal information must be made to affected individuals, and for extensive breaches, notice may need to be made to the media or U.S. state attorneys general or other governmental authorities. Such a notice could harm our reputation and ability to compete.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the EU could be costly and difficult to comply with and could harm our business.\nThe United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. We have based in the UK a significant portion of our non-U.S. clinical, regulatory affairs, and pharmacovigilance operations, as well as our European commercial organization. In anticipation of Brexit, we have taken steps to relocate certain activities from the UK in order to remain in compliance, post-Brexit, with certain laws and regulations in the EU. While the regulatory environment in the UK is currently consistent with that of the EU, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. As such, we could be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the UK that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU, resulting in the duplication of certain costs and new challenges to operate in Europe. The full effect of Brexit is uncertain, and consequently, we cannot at this time fully predict what the outcome may have on our business, particularly if our European operations or presence become a more significant part of our business.\nFluctuations in the value of the Euro or UK pound sterling could negatively impact our results of operations and increase our costs.\nWe generate revenues from sales of Rubraca in the UK and the EU. We also conduct research and development activities in the UK and other European countries and some of the payments for these activities are denominated in Euros and UK pounds sterling. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk, and our results of operations may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro or UK pound sterling, such as the decline in value of the UK pound sterling following the results of the UK\u2019s referendum on withdrawal from the EU. We currently have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts to reduce the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and foreign currency hedging is inherently risky and may result in unanticipated losses.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including the components of our product candidates and other hazardous compounds, and which is expected to include radioactive material contained in FAP-2286. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities, pending use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our research and development efforts and business operations, injury to our employees and others, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up\nand liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nEnvironmental, social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation.\nIncreasingly, in addition to the importance of their financial performance, companies are being judged by their performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, which are considered to contribute to the long-term sustainability of companies\u2019 performance.\nA variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on such ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition, investment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures to their investment decisions. Topics taken into account in such assessments include, among others, the company\u2019s efforts and impacts on climate change and human rights, ethics and compliance with law, and the role of the company\u2019s board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues. In addition to the topics typically considered in such assessments, in our healthcare industry, issues of the public\u2019s ability to access our medicines are of particular importance.\nIn light of investors\u2019 increased focus on ESG matters, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will successfully meet society\u2019s expectations as to our proper role. Any failure or perceived failure by us in this regard could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business, share price, financial condition, or results of operations, including the sustainability of our business over time.\nClimate change, extreme weather events, earthquakes and other natural disasters could adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, extreme weather events and changing weather patterns such as storms, flooding, droughts, fires and temperature changes have become more common. As a result, we are potentially exposed to varying natural disaster or extreme weather risks such as hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, droughts or floods, or other events that may result from the impact of climate change on the environment, such as sea level rise. For example, in the event of a major earthquake, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities, and loss of life, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe potential impacts of climate change may also include increased operating costs associated with additional regulatory requirements and investments in reducing energy, water use and greenhouse gas emissions.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our technologies are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in other foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the\nperiod of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Furthermore, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third-party or instituted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cU.S. PTO\u201d) to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nBecause Rubraca does not contain a previously approved active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a five-year period of new chemical entity (\u201cNCE\u201d) exclusivity following its December 19, 2016 approval during which time generic competitors cannot file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) for a generic version of Rubraca, unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV Certification that one or more patents listed in the Orange Book for Rubraca are invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by a proposed ANDA product, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original drug approval. That is, under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, December 19, 2020 was the earliest date that a generic competitor could submit an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to market a generic version of Rubraca. Since that time, generic entities have been permitted to file an ANDA for rucaparib with a Paragraph IV certification asserting that one or more patents listed in the Orange Book for Rubraca are either not infringed, invalid, or not enforceable. We have not received any Paragraph IV certification notice letters, and to our knowledge, no ANDA filings for rucaparib have been made to date. If a Paragraph IV Certification is made, the generic company is required to provide a Paragraph IV Notice Letter advising Clovis of the certification. If that occurs, Clovis will have the opportunity to bring a patent infringement action against the generic company. If such a suit is filed within the 45-day period following receipt of the Paragraph IV Notice Letter, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a 30-month stay on FDA\u2019s ability to grant final approval of the proposed generic product. The 30-month stay generally runs from the date the Paragraph IV Notice Letter is received. However, when a Paragraph IV certification is received during the five-year period of NCE exclusivity following the date of first NDA approval, the thirty-month stay extends from five years after the date that product was first approved. The 30-month stay may be shortened or lengthened, including due to a settlement of a lawsuit, a court order (including a decision by the district court on the merits of the case), or patent expiration. The party filing the ANDA may also counterclaim in the litigation that one or more of our patents are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed. If all of the Orange-Book listed patents were found invalid, enforceable, and/or not infringed, a competing generic product could be marketed prior to expiration of those patents, which would harm our business.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the U.S. PTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nWe may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our drug discovery and development efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including interference, inter parties review and reexamination proceedings before the U.S. PTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy or patient selection methods, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtain a license, limit our uses, or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, limit our uses, pay royalties or redesign our infringing product candidates, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.\nThe patent protection, patent prosecution and patent enforcement for some of our product candidates is dependent on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek and gain the right to fully prosecute, maintain and enforce the patents relating to our product candidates, there may be times when platform technology patents that relate to our product candidates are controlled by our licensors. This is the case with the method of use patents licensed under the AstraZeneca license. If AstraZeneca or any of our future licensing partners fail to appropriately prosecute, maintain or enforce, as applicable, patent protection for patents covering any of our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to our product candidates from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe license the use, development and commercialization rights for all of our product candidates, and may enter into similar licenses in the future. Under each of our existing license agreements we are subject to commercialization and development, diligence obligations, milestone payment obligations, royalty payments and other obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach our license agreements, including by failing to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or commercialize the product candidate, our licensing partners may have the right to terminate the license in whole or in part. Generally, the loss of any one of our licenses or other licenses in the future could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u25cf others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u25cf we or our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u25cf we or our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u25cf others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u25cf issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u25cf our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u25cf we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u25cf the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock, Convertible Senior Notes and Long-term Debt\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate. If our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our stock could decline.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. As a result, although we may provide sales guidance for Rubraca from time to time, you should not rely on Rubraca sales results in any period as being indicative of future performance. In addition, such guidance is based on assumptions that may be incorrect or that may change from quarter to quarter, and it may be particularly difficult to correctly forecast sales in indications for which we have recently received marketing approval. Moreover, sales of Rubraca have, on occasion, been below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and have been below prior period sales, and sales of Rubraca in the future may also be below prior period sales, our own guidance and/or the expectations of securities analysts and investors. To the extent that we do not meet any guidance we may give or the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price may be adversely impacted, perhaps significantly. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf customer ordering patterns for Rubraca, which may vary significantly from period to period;\n\u25cf the overall level of demand for Rubraca, including the impact of any competitive products and the duration of therapy for patients receiving Rubraca;\n\u25cf the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for Rubraca is available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed care programs and other third-party payors;\n\u25cf our ability to establish or demonstrate to patients and the medical community the safety, efficacy or value of Rubraca and its perceived advantages compared to existing and future therapies in the recurrent ovarian cancer indications and other indications for which Rubraca may receive approval in the future;\n\u25cf changes in the amount of deductions from gross sales, including government-mandated rebates, chargebacks and discounts that can vary because of changes to the government discount percentage, including increases in the government discount percentage resulting from price increases we have taken or may take in the future, or due to different levels of utilization by entities entitled to government rebates and discounts and changes in patient demographics;\n\u25cf increases in the scope of eligibility for customers to purchase Rubraca at the discounted government price or to obtain government-mandated rebates on purchases of Rubraca;\n\u25cf changes in our cost of sales;\n\u25cf the incidence rate of new patients in Rubraca\u2019s approved indications;\n\u25cf the timing, cost and level of investment in our sales and marketing efforts to support Rubraca sales; and\n\u25cf the timing, cost and level of investment in our research and development and other activities involving Rubraca, lucitanib and our other product candidates by us or our collaborators.\nFurther, changes in our operations, such as increased development, manufacturing and clinical trial expenses in connection with our development programs, or our undertaking of additional programs, or business activities, or entry into strategic transactions, including potential future acquisitions of products, technologies or businesses may also cause significant fluctuations in our expenses.\nFor these and other reasons, it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future sales of Rubraca, operating expenses or future profits or losses. As a result, our operating results in future periods could be below any guidance we may give or the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps substantially.\nThe price of our stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. During the 12-month period ended December 31, 2021, the price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from $2.70 per share to $10.34 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, these factors include:\n\u25cf our ability and the perception of others as to whether we will be able to continue as a going concern;\n\u25cf adverse results of regulatory actions or decisions;\n\u25cf our failure to successfully commercialize our products;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated adverse results or delays in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of any of our products;\n\u25cf changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u25cf disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our products;\n\u25cf our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u25cf inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved drug product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u25cf our dependence on third parties, including CMOS and CROs, as well as our partners that provide us with companion diagnostic products;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed any financial guidance or expectations regarding development milestones that we may provide to the public;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u25cf overall performance of the equity markets and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries;\n\u25cf introduction of new products offered by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf issuances of debt or equity securities and perceptions of our ability to issue additional debt and equity securities to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our operations;\n\u25cf significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u25cf trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf publication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u25cf ineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u25cf general political and economic conditions;\n\u25cf effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Select Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nBecause our outstanding Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, volatility or depressed prices of our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of our Notes. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling in our common stock by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders. Holders of the outstanding 2025 Notes are able to convert them at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 1, 2025. Holders of the outstanding 2024 Notes are able to convert them at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 1, 2024. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive shares of common stock. Any sales in the public market of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of such Notes could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price of our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities.\nFollowing periods of volatility in a company\u2019s stock price, litigation has often been initiated against companies. Following the decline in our stock price related to the rociletinib regulatory update in November 2015, a number of lawsuits have been filed against us and settled. The remaining litigation related to rociletinib are discussed in Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings. These proceedings and other similar litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement contains a number of covenants and other provisions, which, if violated, could result in the immediate acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nPursuant to our ATHENA clinical trial financing agreement, we are required to repay amounts we borrow from the lenders, capped at specific quarterly amounts, based upon the revenues generated from the sales of Rubraca and other amounts we receive in connection with any out-licensing arrangement or settlement we may enter into with respect to Rubraca. If the total payments made on or prior to December 30, 2025 are less than the total amount borrowed prior to such time, we also would be required to make an additional lump-sum payment to the lenders equal to the amount of that shortfall on that date. Following that date, quarterly payments continue until the lenders have received payments equal to twice the amount borrowed under the financing agreement.\nPursuant to the financing agreement, we have agreed to certain limitations on our operations, including limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and repayments of certain indebtedness, and to certain covenants, including with respect to the conduct of the ATHENA trial. Our obligations under the financing agreement are secured by first priority security interests in all of our assets related to Rubraca, including intellectual property rights.\nIf an event of default (including a breach or default under, or termination of, any of our material in-license agreements and defaults under our other material indebtedness) occurs under the financing agreement, the lenders have the right to demand immediate repayment of our obligations, which may be as high as twice the amount borrowed thereunder.\nIn addition, if we do not pay our obligations under the financing agreement when due, including at maturity or upon the occurrence of a liquidity event, which includes a change of control of us or upon demand following the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders would have the right to foreclose on the assets we have pledged as collateral and sell those assets, with the proceeds of the sale being applied to repay the indebtedness.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not breach the covenants or other terms of, or that an event of default will not occur under, the financing agreement and, if a breach or event of default occurs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary waivers or amendments from the lenders or refinance the related indebtedness on terms we find acceptable, or at all. A default under the financing agreement may also trigger defaults under the indentures governing our senior convertible notes.\nAs a result, any failure to pay our obligations when due, any breach or default of our covenants or other obligations under the financing agreement, or any other event that allows any lender to demand immediate repayment of borrowings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, the financing agreement may make us less attractive to potential acquirers; and in the event of a change of control of us, the required discharge of the financing agreement out of our available cash or acquisition proceeds would reduce proceeds available to our stockholders.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nShares of common stock that are reserved for future issuance under the Notes will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the terms of the Notes. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nPursuant to our equity incentive plan(s), our compensation committee (or its designee) is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our employees, directors and consultants. See Part II, Item 5 - Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for the number of shares of our common stock available for future grant under our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. Future option and restricted stock unit grants and issuances of common stock under our 2011 Plan may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Notes.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u25cf creating a staggered board of directors;\n\u25cf prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf permitting our board of directors to accelerate the vesting of outstanding option grants upon certain transactions that result in a change of control; and\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. Additionally, certain provisions of our outstanding Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. The repurchase price of the Notes must be paid in cash, and this obligation may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing an acquisition of the Company that would otherwise be beneficial to our security holders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. In fact, we have had analysts cease coverage of our company in 2021.\nThere may not be a viable public market for our common stock and as a result it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock had not been publicly traded prior to our initial public offering in November 2011. An active trading market for our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market may not be sustained. As a result of these and other factors, you may be unable to resell your shares at a price that is attractive to you or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares of common stock as consideration.", "PERMNO": 13107, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CLVS"}
