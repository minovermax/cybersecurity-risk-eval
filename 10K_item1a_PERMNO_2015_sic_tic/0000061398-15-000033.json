{"cik": "61398", "company": "MAGELLAN PETROLEUM CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-10-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information included in this report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating an investment in us. These risk factors and other uncertainties may cause our actual future results or performance to differ materially from any future results or performance expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in this report and in other public statements we make. In addition, because of these risks and uncertainties, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, our past financial performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe incurred losses from operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 of $43.4 million. In addition, working capital decreased from $25.6 million at June 30, 2014 to $3.9 million at June 30, 2015. We continue to experience decreased liquidity as a result of the recent decline in oil and gas commodity prices and other factors discussed below. Consequently, we have begun selling some non-core assets to fund our operations. However, proceeds from these asset sales may not provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the next twelve months. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements included in this report do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur current liquidity position is very constrained.\nDuring the twelve months ended June 30, 2015, we used $15.4 million in cash and, as of June 30, 2015, we had $1.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The decline in cash and cash equivalents is primarily the result of the cost of injecting CO2 in and managing the pilot program at Poplar, the loss from operations at Poplar due to the decrease in oil prices, and our general and administrative expenses. As of October 9, 2015, our cash balances amounted to approximately $620 thousand, and we currently have a monthly cash burn rate ranging between $500 thousand and $750 thousand. Accordingly, we are facing significant liquidity constraints in the short term, and there is a substantial risk that we will not be able to fund our activities on an ongoing basis. Although we have been implementing some cost savings initiatives and are working on alternatives to fund our activities, there is no assurance that those initiatives and alternatives will be successful. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Consolidated Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d included in this report.\nA legal proceeding initiated by Celtique may have a material adverse effect on our interests in the central Weald Basin of the UK.\nIn the central Weald Basin of the UK, we co-own equally with Celtique three licenses, PEDLs 231, 234, and 243, representing 124 thousand net acres that may be prospective for oil and gas development. During the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we received a cash call from Celtique for the advancement of estimated expenses in the amount of $2.0 million in connection with the Broadford Bridge-1 well, the site for which is located within the PEDL 234 license area, and we are evaluating our alternatives under the applicable joint operating agreement. During the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, Celtique initiated a legal proceeding against us with respect to that cash call and related issues. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies - Celtique Litigation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further information. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, which may have a material adverse effect on our interests in the central Weald licenses and/or require the payment of amounts for which we would need to obtain funding.\nOil prices have decreased substantially from historic highs and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Any additional decreases in prices of oil may materially and adversely affect our cash generated from operations, results of operations, financial position, our ability to repay our debt, and the trading price of our common stock.\nSince the second half of 2014, oil prices have declined significantly. After averaging $101.05 per barrel in the first half of calendar 2014, West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) oil prices averaged $85.54 per barrel for the second half of calendar 2014, declined to $59.48 per barrel on June 30, 2015, and were $49.63 per barrel on October 9, 2015. As a result of the decrease in oil prices, we incurred an impairment of oil and gas properties of $17.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. In addition, as a result of similarly decreased oil and natural gas prices in Australia, we incurred a loss on the sale of securities and an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment in securities totaling $15.1 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, which was largely attributable to an unrealized loss on our investment in the securities of Central. We may incur additional impairments of our oil and gas properties and losses on our investment in securities if prices do not increase. The possibility and amounts of any future impairments or losses are difficult to predict, and will depend, in part, upon future oil and natural gas prices. The International Energy Agency forecasts continued U.S. production growth and a slowdown in global demand growth in 2015. This environment could cause the prices for oil to remain at current levels or to fall to lower levels. If prices for oil continue to remain depressed for lengthy periods, we may be required to write down the value of our oil and gas properties, and some of our current projects may no longer be economically viable. In addition, sustained low prices for oil will negatively impact the value of our estimated proved reserves and reduce the amounts of cash we would otherwise have available to pay expenses and service our indebtedness.\nOur CO2-EOR project at Poplar may not be successful.\nIn August 2013, we initiated a five-well CO2-EOR pilot program for the Charles formation at the Poplar field to enhance oil recovery through the injection of CO2 into the formation. All five wells have been drilled to total depth, and we have conducted the initial CO2 injection phase of the program. Through June 30, 2015, we had incurred approximately $27.3 million in capitalized costs in connection with the pilot program, and we currently believe that costs related to the pilot program, including capital and certain operating expenditures, will be limited to i) the ongoing costs of operating the five wells, which form the CO2-EOR pilot and ii) the cost of purchasing CO2, to the extent the company decides to resume the injection of CO2 in the CO2-EOR pilot. While laboratory analysis and other tests indicate that a CO2-EOR project at Poplar should be technically and economically viable on a full-field and long-term basis, the additional production and reserves that may result from CO2-EOR methods are inherently difficult to predict. For example, although CO2 may be successfully injected through an injector well and initially result in satisfactory increased pressures, it is possible that such pressures may not be sustained at sufficient effective levels to sweep the oil across the formation to the production wells. If CO2-EOR methods at Poplar ultimately do not allow for the extraction of additional oil in the manner or to the extent that we anticipate, our future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our ability to utilize CO2 as an enhanced recovery technique is subject to the ability to obtain sufficient quantities of CO2. Although we currently have a short-term CO2 supply agreement for the pilot program, if the quantities of CO2 available to Poplar become limited, there may not be sufficient CO2 to produce oil in the manner or to the extent that we anticipate, and our future oil production volumes could be negatively impacted.\nSubstantially all of our currently producing properties are located in the Poplar field, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having revenue-producing operations currently concentrated in one geographic area.\nBecause our current revenue-producing operations are geographically concentrated in the Poplar field in the Montana portion of the Williston Basin, the success and profitability of our operations are disproportionately exposed to risks associated with regional factors. These include, among others, fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in the region, other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline, and rail transportation capacity constraints, available rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies, labor, and infrastructure capacity, and the effects of regional or local governmental regulations. In addition, our operations at Poplar may be adversely affected by seasonal weather and wildlife protection measures, which can intensify competition for the items described above during months when drilling is possible and may result in periodic shortages. The concentration of our operations in this region also increases exposure to unexpected events that may occur in this region such as natural disasters or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to cause a relatively significant number of our producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, and prevent development or production within originally anticipated time frames. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur Poplar production revenues and cash flows are concentrated with one purchaser, and that purchaser may reduce or discontinue purchases or become unable to meet its payment obligations to us.\nSales of our Poplar oil production are currently concentrated with an agreement with Plains Marketing, LP, who is the sole purchaser of our oil production at Poplar. If this purchaser reduces or discontinues purchases from us, or if we are unable to successfully negotiate a replacement agreement with this purchaser, who can terminate the agreement after a 90-day notice period, or if the replacement agreement has less favorable terms, the effect on us could be materially adverse if we are unable to obtain new purchasers for the oil produced at Poplar. In addition, if this purchaser were to experience financial difficulties or any deterioration in its ability to satisfy its payment obligations to us, our revenues and cash flows from Poplar could be adversely affected to a material extent.\nRegulations related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays that could affect the value of our potential unconventional play in the United Kingdom.\nWe along with Celtique currently have a 50%-50% working interest in a potential unconventional play in the central Weald Basin in southern England that is operated by Celtique. Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including unconventional gas resources. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Although the UK government lifted a temporary moratorium on hydraulic\nfracturing in December 2012 and an Office of Unconventional Gas and Oil has been established in the UK to coordinate the related activities of various regulatory authorities, hydraulic fracturing remains a publicly controversial topic, with media and local community concerns regarding the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater, and the environment generally. For example, local planning permission requirements in the UK may have the effect of restricting or delaying drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If hydraulic fracturing is significantly restricted or delayed at our potential unconventional play in the UK, or made more costly, the volumes of natural gas that can be economically recovered could be reduced, which would adversely affect the value of the play.\nOur use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our Australian NT/P82 prospect and other exploration and development activities.\nWe have incurred significant expenditures to acquire extensive 2-D and 3-D seismic data with respect to our NT/P82 exploration permit area in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore Northern Territory, Australia, and we use 2-D and 3-D seismic data in our other exploration and development activities. Even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators, and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.\nWe may not be successful in sharing the exploration and development costs of the fields, licenses, and permits in which we hold interests, such as our Australian NT/P82 prospect.\nOur current drilling plans depend, in certain cases, on our ability to enter into farm-in, farmout, joint venture, or other cost sharing arrangements with other oil and gas companies. For example, we are engaged in a farmout process for our NT/P82 exploration permit area, in which we plan to relinquish a portion of our working interest in, and operatorship of, NT/P82 in exchange for a commitment from the partner to drill exploration wells over the gas prospects identified in the block to meet our requirements under the terms of the permit. If we are not able to secure such farm-in, farmout, or other arrangements in a timely manner, or on terms which are economically attractive to us, we may be forced to bear higher exploration and development costs with respect to our fields and interests. We may also be unable to fully develop and/or explore certain fields if the costs to do so would exceed our available liquidity and capital resources. In either case, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe may not realize the expected value and potential liquidity from our significant investment in Central Petroleum Limited.\nOn March 31, 2014, we sold our non-core assets in the Amadeus Basin of Australia to Central Petroleum Limited, in exchange for AUD $20.0 million in cash and 39.5 million shares of Central's stock, which are listed for trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (\"ASX\") and which represented an approximately 11% equity ownership interest in Central. Under the terms of the agreement for that transaction, the Central shares were valued at AUD $15.0 million. As of June 30, 2015, the Central shares were carried on our balance sheet at a fair value of $4.2 million, based on the closing per share market price for Central stock as reported on the ASX on that date and applicable foreign currency translation adjustments.\nCentral is a Brisbane, Australia based junior exploration and production company that operates one of the largest holdings of prospective onshore acreage in Australia. Accordingly, Central and the value of its stock are subject to similar business, industry, and oil and natural gas price fluctuation risk factors that we are subject to, as well as Central's own particular risk factors based on its current circumstances and operating areas in Australia. As a result, or for other reasons, the market price of Central stock may experience significant fluctuations, including significant decreases. We do not control Central, and our investment is subject to the risk that Central may make business, financial, or management decisions with which we do not agree. Although the shares of Central that we hold are not restricted and may be sold on the ASX, the average daily trading volumes for Central stock relative to the number of Central shares that we hold may mean that our Central shares would need to be sold over a substantial period of time, exposing our investment return to risks of downward movement in the market price during the intended disposition period. Accordingly, we may ultimately realize a lower value and potential liquidity from our investment in Central than we expect.\nExploration and development drilling may not result in commercially producible reserves.\nCrude oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially producible crude oil or natural gas will be found. The cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain, and crude oil or natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\ndisputes with owners or holders of surface interests on or near areas where we intend to drill;\n\u2022\npressure or geologic irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nengineering and construction delays;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the availability of or increases in the cost of drilling rigs and crews, equipment, pipe, water, and other supplies.\nThe prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas affect the cost of, and demand for, drilling rigs, completion and production equipment, and other related services. However, changes in costs may not occur simultaneously with corresponding changes in commodity prices. The availability of drilling rigs can vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Although land drilling rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of demand, an undersupply of rigs in any region may result in drilling delays and higher drilling costs for the rigs that are available in that region. In addition, general and industry economic and financial downturns can adversely affect the financial condition of some drilling contractors, which may constrain the availability of drilling services in some areas.\nAnother significant risk inherent in drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state, local, and other governmental authorities. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and drilling permits, including delays that jeopardize our ability to realize the potential benefits from leased or licensed properties within the applicable lease or license periods, the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well, or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore on or develop the properties we have or may acquire.\nThe wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well if crude oil or natural gas is present, or whether it can be produced economically. The cost of drilling, completing, and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Drilling activities can result in dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs to cover initial drilling and completion costs.\nOur future drilling activities may not be successful. Although we have identified potential drilling locations, we may not be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from them.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services of our executive management team and other key personnel. The ability to retain officers and key employees is important to our success and growth. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on our business. Our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers, landmen, and other professionals. Competition for many of these professionals is intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel and professionals, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nWe have limited management and staff and are dependent upon partnering arrangements.\nWe had 20 total employees as of June 30, 2015. Due to our limited number of employees, we expect that we will continue to require the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, including reservoir engineering, land, legal, environmental, and tax services. We also plan to pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation, evaluation, and prospect leasing. Our dependence on third party consultants and service providers creates a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects.\nIf we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or poor performance by such parties, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThere are risks inherent in foreign operations and investments, such as adverse changes in currency values and foreign regulations relating to MPUK's, MPA's, and Central's exploration and development operations, and potential taxes or restrictions on dividends to MPC from foreign subsidiaries or investments.\nThe properties in which we have operating or investment interests that are located outside the US are subject to certain risks related to the indirect ownership and development of, or investment in, foreign properties, including government expropriation and nationalization, adverse changes in currency values and foreign exchange controls, foreign taxes, US taxes on the repatriation of funds to the US, and other laws and regulations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our properties, investments, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Although there are currently no foreign exchange controls on the payment of dividends to MPC by its subsidiaries or other entities in which it has invested, such payments could be restricted by foreign exchange controls, if implemented.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. Further declines in prices could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to grow.\nOur revenues, results of operations, future rate of growth, and the carrying value of our oil and gas properties depend heavily on the prices we receive for the crude oil and natural gas we sell. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The markets for crude oil and natural gas have historically been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas, and the productive capacity of the oil and gas industry as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply and the level of consumer demand for such fuels;\n\u2022\noverall global and domestic economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in oil, natural gas, and other fuel-producing and fuel-consuming areas;\n\u2022\nthe extent of US, UK, and Australian domestic oil and gas production and the consumption and importation of such fuels and substitute fuels in US, UK, Australian, and other relevant markets;\n\u2022\nthe availability and capacity of gathering, transportation, processing, and/or refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for crude oil or natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and liquefied natural gas;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including effects of weather conditions on prices and supplies in worldwide energy markets;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption and conservation;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporting countries to agree to and maintain crude oil prices and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe competitive position of each such fuel as a source of energy as compared to other energy sources;\n\u2022\nstrengthening and weakening of the US dollar relative to other currencies; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of governmental regulations and taxes on the production, transportation, and sale of oil, natural gas, and other fuels.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and gas price movements with any certainty, but in general we expect oil and gas prices to continue to fluctuate significantly.\nFurther and sustained declines in oil and gas prices would not only reduce our revenues but also could reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reserves. Further, oil and gas prices do not necessarily move in tandem. Future oil and gas sales would generate lower revenue if oil and natural gas prices were to continue to decline. Prices for sales of our oil production are primarily affected by global oil prices, and the volatility of those prices will affect future oil revenues.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do.\nWe face intense competition from major oil and gas companies and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies who seek oil and gas investments throughout the world, as well as the equipment, expertise, labor, and materials\nrequired to explore, develop, and operate crude oil and natural gas properties. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, and other resources vastly exceeding those available to us, and many crude oil and natural gas properties are sold in a competitive bidding process in which our competitors may be able and willing to pay more for development prospects and productive properties, or in which our competitors have technological information or expertise that is not available to us to evaluate and successfully bid for the properties. In addition, shortages of equipment, labor, or materials as a result of intense competition may result in increased costs or the inability to obtain those resources as needed. We may not be successful in acquiring, exploring, and developing profitable properties in the face of this competition.\nWe also compete for human resources. Over the last several years, the need for talented people across all disciplines in the industry has grown, while the number of talented people available has not grown at the same pace, and in many cases, is declining due to the demographics of the industry.\nOur acquisitions of or investments in new oil and gas properties or other assets may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.\nSuccessful property or other acquisitions or investments require an assessment of a number of factors sometimes beyond our control. These factors include exploration potential, future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, and potential environmental and other liabilities. These assessments are not precise, and their accuracy is inherently uncertain.\nIn connection with our acquisitions or investments, we typically perform a customary review of the properties that will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. We do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities. Normally, we acquire interests or otherwise invest in properties on an \"as is\" basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties.\nIn addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties. To the extent acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties, our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such acquisitions may be limited.\nIntegrating acquired properties and businesses involves a number of other special risks, including the risk that management may be distracted from normal business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems as well as retain and assimilate additional employees. Therefore, we may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Consideration paid for any future acquisitions or investments could include our stock or require that we incur additional debt and contingent liabilities. As a result, future acquisitions or investments could cause dilution of existing equity interests and earnings per share.\nOur operations are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations that result in substantial costs and other risks.\nUS federal, state, tribal, and local authorities, and corresponding UK and Australian governmental authorities, extensively regulate the oil and natural gas industry. Legislation and regulations affecting the industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion, raising the possibility of changes that may become more stringent and, as a result, may affect, among other things, the pricing or marketing of crude oil and natural gas production. Noncompliance with statutes and regulations and more vigorous enforcement of such statutes and regulations by regulatory agencies may lead to substantial administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including the assessment of natural resource damages, the imposition of significant investigatory and remedial obligations, and may also result in the suspension or termination of our operations. The overall regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost to place, design, drill, complete, install, operate, and abandon wells and related facilities and, in turn, decreases profitability.\nGovernmental authorities regulate various aspects of drilling for and the production of crude oil and natural gas, including the permit and bonding requirements of drilling wells, the spacing of wells, the unitization or pooling of interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, rights-of-way and easements, environmental matters, occupational health and safety, the sharing of markets, production limitations, plugging, abandonment, and restoration standards, and oil and gas operations. Public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain projects. Under certain circumstances, regulatory authorities may deny a proposed permit or right-of-way or impose conditions of approval to mitigate potential environmental impacts, which could, in either case, negatively affect our ability to explore or develop certain properties. Governmental authorities also may require any of our ongoing or planned\noperations on their leases or licenses to be delayed, suspended, or terminated. Any such delay, suspension, or termination could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur operations are also subject to complex and constantly changing environmental laws and regulations adopted by federal, state, tribal, and local governmental authorities in jurisdictions where we are engaged in exploration or production operations. New laws or regulations, or changes to current requirements, could result in material costs or claims with respect to properties we own or have owned. We will continue to be subject to uncertainty associated with new regulatory interpretations and inconsistent interpretations between various regulatory agencies. Under existing or future environmental laws and regulations, we could incur significant liability, including joint and several liability or strict liability under federal, state, and tribal environmental laws for noise emissions and for discharges of crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids or other pollutants into the air, soil, surface water, or groundwater. We could be required to spend substantial amounts on investigations, litigation, and remediation for these discharges and other compliance issues. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our operations could result not only in cleanup costs but also natural resources, real or personal property, and other compensatory damages and civil and criminal liability. Existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or enforced, or as they may be interpreted, enforced, or altered in the future, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, we may be subject to increased environmental law enforcement initiatives. For example, the EPA's current National Enforcement Initiatives include \"Ensuring Energy Extraction Activities Comply with Environmental Laws.\" According to the EPA's website, \"some techniques for natural gas extraction pose a significant risk to public health and the environment.\" To address these concerns, the EPA's goal is to \"address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health and/or the environment.\" This initiative could involve an investigation of our facilities and processes, and could lead to potential enforcement actions, penalties, or injunctive relief against us.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for crude oil and natural gas.\nDue to concerns about the risks of global warming and climate change, a number of various national and regional legislative and regulatory initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency has been adopting and implementing various rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the US Clean Air Act, the US Congress has from time to time considered other legislative initiatives to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas emission allowance cap and trade programs. In addition, in 2013, the US President announced a Climate Action Plan which, among other things, directs US federal agencies to develop a strategy for the reduction of methane emissions, including emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. In November 2014, the US President announced that the US would seek to cut net greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 in return for China's commitment to seek to peak emissions around 2030, with concurrent increases in renewable energy.\nLegislative and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur substantially increased capital, operating, maintenance, and compliance costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, costs to acquire emissions allowances, and costs to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislative or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislative and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more extreme weather conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our development and production activities, increase our costs of operations or reduce the efficiency of our operations, and potentially increase costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such conditions. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process related services provided by midstream companies, service companies, or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses, or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThis report contains estimates of our proved and probable reserves and the estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex. The process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic data for each reservoir. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from these estimates. Any significant variation of any nature could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our proved reserves, and the actual quantities and present value may be significantly less than we have previously estimated. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, costs to develop and operate properties, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by operators on adjacent properties. Probable reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the average, first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period preceding the measurement date, in accordance with SEC rules. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactual costs of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation, including severance and excise taxes.\nThe timing of production from oil and natural gas properties and of related expenses affects the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor required by the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes may not be the most appropriate discount factor in view of actual interest rates, costs of capital, and other risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book proved undeveloped reserves in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and may continue to limit in the future our ability to book proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue drilling programs on our undeveloped properties. In addition, we may be required to write down any booked proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill the scheduled wells within the required five-year timeframe.\nSubstantial capital is required for our business and projects.\nOur exploration, development, and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, farming-in other companies or investors to our exploration and development projects in which we have an interest, sales of non-core assets, and/or debt or equity financings. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices for oil and natural gas, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. If revenues decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices or decreased production, and our access to capital continues to be limited, we will have a reduced ability to explore and develop our properties and replace our reserves. If our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures, we must reduce our capital expenditures unless we can raise additional capital through debt, equity, or other financings or the divestment of assets. Debt or equity financing may not always be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, and the proceeds offered to us for potential divestitures may not always be of acceptable value to us.\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, we will not be able to sustain production.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful exploration, development, or acquisition activities, our reserves will decline over time. Recovery of any additional reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. We may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future. In addition, we may not be able to acquire proved or probable reserves at acceptable costs.\nFuture price declines may result in further write-downs of our asset carrying values.\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas operations. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether proved reserves have been discovered. If proved reserves are not discovered with an exploratory well, the costs of drilling the well are expensed.\nThe capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, on a depletion pool basis, cannot exceed the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of that depletion pool. If net capitalized costs exceed undiscounted future net revenues, we generally must write down the costs of each depletion pool to the estimated fair value (discounted future net cash flows of that depletion pool). For example, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, as a result of significant declines in oil commodity prices, we incurred an impairment loss of $17.4 million on our proved oil and gas properties. A further significant decline in oil or natural gas prices from current levels, or other factors, could cause a further impairment write-down of capitalized costs and a non-cash charge against future earnings. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date, even if oil or natural gas prices increase.\nOil and gas drilling and production operations are hazardous and expose us to environmental liabilities.\nOil and gas operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failure, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, or well fluids, and other environmental hazards and risks. Our drilling operations involve risks from high pressures and from mechanical difficulties such as stuck pipes, collapsed casings, and separated cables. If any of these or similar events occur, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to, or destruction of, property, natural resources, and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties; and\n\u2022\nsuspension of operations.\nOur liability for environmental hazards may include those created either by the previous owners of properties that we purchase, lease, or license, or by acquired companies prior to the date we acquire them. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase.\nWeakness in economic conditions or uncertainty in financial markets may have material adverse impacts on our business that we cannot predict.\nIn recent years, the US, UK, Australian, and global economies and financial systems have experienced turmoil and upheaval characterized by extreme volatility and declines in prices of securities, diminished liquidity and credit availability, inability to access capital markets, the bankruptcy, failure, collapse, or sale of financial institutions, increased levels of unemployment, and an unprecedented level of government intervention. Although some portions of the economy appear to have stabilized and may be recovering, the extent and timing of a recovery, and whether it can be sustained, are uncertain. Renewed weakness in the US, UK, Australian, or other large economies could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, purchasers of our oil and gas production may reduce the amounts of oil and gas they purchase from us and/or delay or be unable to make timely payments to us.\nIn addition, some of our oil and gas properties are operated by third parties that we depend on for timely performance of drilling and other contractual obligations and, in some cases, for distribution to us of our proportionate share of revenues from sales of oil and natural gas production. If weak economic conditions adversely impact our third party operators, we are exposed to the risk that drilling operations or revenue disbursements to us could be delayed or suspended.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nSome of the properties in which we have an ownership interest are operated by other companies. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the development and operation of those properties. The timing and success of drilling and development activities on those properties depend on a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator's:\n\u2022\ndetermination of the nature and timing of drilling and operational activities;\n\u2022\ndetermination of the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpertise and financial resources;\n\u2022\napproval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022\nselection of suitable technology.\nThe failure of an operator of our properties to adequately perform development and operational activities, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements, or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production, revenues, and reserves, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect our operating results.\nThe exchange rates between the US dollar and the British pound, as well as the exchange rates between the Australian dollar and the US dollar, have fluctuated in recent periods and may fluctuate substantially in the future. We expect that a majority of our revenues will be denominated in US dollars in the future. However, because of our UK development program, a portion of our expenses, including exploration costs and capital and operating expenditures, will continue to be denominated in British pounds. Accordingly, any material appreciation of the British pound against the US dollar could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our foreign exchange transaction loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, was $635 thousand and is included under general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.\nProposed changes to US tax laws, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe US President's budget proposals have included recommendations that would, if enacted, make significant changes to US tax laws applicable to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, and legislation has been previously introduced in the US Congress that would implement many of these proposals. These proposed changes include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\neliminating the current deduction for intangible drilling and development costs;\n\u2022\neliminating the deduction for certain US production activities for oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nrepealing the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; and\n\u2022\nextending the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\nThese proposed changes in the US tax laws, if adopted, or other similar changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOne Stone has significant influence on our major corporate decisions, including veto power over some matters, and could take actions that could be adverse to other stockholders. In addition, One Stone has rights as a holder of preferred stock that are senior to, and could disadvantage, holders of our common stock.\nIn May 2013, we issued 19.2 million shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to an affiliate of One Stone for approximately $23.5 million. Additional shares of Series A preferred stock have since been issued to the One Stone affiliate in payment of preferred stock dividends, and the One Stone affiliate held a total of 21.2 million shares of Series A preferred stock as of June 30, 2015, which represents approximately 32% of our outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. The certificate of designations governing the Series A preferred stock provides the holder of such stock with certain rights relating to our business and management, including the right to appoint a specified number of members of our board of directors (currently two); the right to vote on an as-converted basis with our common stockholders on matters submitted to a stockholder vote; the right to veto certain corporate actions, including some related party transactions and changes to our capital budget;\nand the right to receive a cash payment providing it with a specified rate of return in the event of certain change of control transactions. As a result of the foregoing, One Stone has significant influence on our major corporate decisions, and matters requiring stockholder approval. The interests of One Stone may differ from the interests of our other stockholders in some circumstances, and the ability of One Stone to influence certain of our major corporate decisions may harm the market price of our common stock by delaying, deferring, or preventing transactions that are or are perceived to be in the best interest of other stockholders or by discouraging third-party investors. In addition, the Series A preferred stock is senior to our common stock in terms of the right to receive dividends and payments in the event of a liquidation. These preferences could disadvantage the holders of our common stock, and may make it more difficult for us to raise equity capital in the future.\nOur interests in the United Kingdom are subject to licenses that could be forfeited if certain drilling requirements are not met.\nWe own certain interests in the UK that are subject to licenses issued by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change under the UK Petroleum Act 1998. In order to retain the interests granted by the licenses, we are required to meet certain drilling requirements. If these drilling requirements are not met or waived, the interests granted by the licenses would be forfeited.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses for investors.\nDuring the past several years, the stock markets in general and for oil and gas exploration and production companies in particular have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results and asset values of the underlying companies. In addition, due to relatively low trading volumes for our common stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the markets as a whole. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nchanges in crude oil or natural gas commodity prices;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\ninvestment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the business, earnings estimates, or market perceptions of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry, general market, or regional or global economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nannouncements of legislative or regulatory changes affecting our business or our industry.\nFluctuations in the market price of our common stock may be significant, and may result in declines in the market price and losses for investors.\nWe may issue a significant number of shares of common stock under outstanding stock options, future equity awards under our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, and our outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock, and common stockholders may be adversely affected by the issuance and sale of those shares.\nAs of June 30, 2015, we had 1,032,334 stock options outstanding, as adjusted to reflect the one share for eight share reverse split of our common stock completed on July 10, 2015, of which 679,057 were fully vested and exercisable, and 21,162,697 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock outstanding. As of that date, there were 169,453 shares of common stock remaining available for future awards under our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. If all of the 1,032,334 outstanding stock options, which have exercise prices ranging from $8.08 to $17.22 per share, are exercised, or the outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock are converted, the shares of common stock issued would represent approximately 15% and 32%, respectively, of the outstanding common shares. Sales of those shares could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, even if our business is doing well.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, its liquidity and value could be reduced.\nIn order for us to maintain the listing of our shares of common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the common stock must maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 as set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2). If the closing bid price of the common stock is below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, which occurred in December 2014-January 2015, then the closing bid price of the common stock must be $1.00 or more for 10 consecutive trading days during a 180-day grace period to regain compliance with the rule, which occurred in July 2015, after we completed a one share for eight shares reverse split of our common stock on July 10, 2015. On October 9, 2015, the closing market price of our common stock was $0.70 per share. If our common stock is delisted from trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, it may be eligible for trading on the OTCQB, but the delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ could adversely impact the liquidity and value of our common stock. In addition, the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market is one of the conditions to our ability to utilize the \u201cat-the-market\u201d (\u201cATM\u201d) common stock financing facility that we implemented on December 24, 2014, and a delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market could impair our ability to utilize the ATM facility and related shelf registration statement that was declared effective on December 3, 2014.\nThe recent reverse stock split of our shares of common stock may decrease the market trading liquidity of the shares due to the reduced number of shares outstanding, and may potentially have an anti-takeover effect.\nIn July 2015, we effected a one-for-eight reverse stock split of our shares of common stock in order to increase the bid price to more than $1.00 per share and thus maintain the listing for our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Although the reverse stock split was intended to avoid decreased liquidity for the shares in the event of a delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market, the liquidity of the shares may be adversely affected by the reverse stock split as a result of the reduced number of shares outstanding following the reverse stock split. In addition, the reverse stock split may have increased the number of stockholders who own odd lots (less than 100 shares) of our common stock, creating the potential for such stockholders to experience an increase in the cost of selling their shares and greater difficulty effecting such sales. Further, since the stockholder-approved reverse stock split was accomplished without a corresponding reduction in the number of shares authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation, the relative increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect by enabling the Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common stock in a transaction making it more difficult for a party to obtain control of us by tender offer or other means.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our common stockholders.\nSubject to the satisfaction of the dividend rights of our Series A convertible preferred stock, which provide for a dividend equivalent of 7.0% per annum on the issue price plus any accumulated unpaid dividends, payable in the form of cash, in kind (in the form of additional shares of Series A preferred stock), or a combination thereof (at our option), we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings, if any, to reduce our accumulated deficit and finance the growth and development of our business. The Series A preferred stock ranks senior to the common stock with respect to dividends and other rights, and we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and any other factors that our board determines to be relevant. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our common stockholders.\nOur largest stockholder beneficially owns a significant percentage of our common stock, and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAs of June 30, 2015, One Stone Holdings II LP owns 21,162,697 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock, and thereby currently beneficially owns approximately 32% of our common stock, assuming full conversion of the Series A preferred stock. The Series A preferred stock is entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with the common stock. In addition, two individuals affiliated with One Stone serve on our six-member board of directors. As a result, One Stone is able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our organizational documents, and significant corporate transactions. Further, for so long as One Stone owns at least 10% of the fully diluted common stock, assuming full conversion of the Series A preferred stock, One Stone will hold veto rights with\nrespect to capital expenditures greater than $15.0 million that are not provided for in the then-current annual budget, changes in our principal line of business, an increase in the size of our board to more than 12 members, and certain other matters.\nThe concentration of ownership and voting power with One Stone may make it more difficult for any other holder or group of holders of our common stock to be able to significantly influence the way we are managed or the direction of our business. The interests of One Stone with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings, and other corporate opportunities, and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may make it more difficult for another company to acquire us and for stockholders to receive any related takeover premium unless One Stone approves the acquisition.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a takeover premium on their investment.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various barriers to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be attractive to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize us to issue preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u2022\nclassify our board of directors so that only some of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting.\nThese provisions also may delay, prevent, or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest, or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their common stock.", "PERMNO": 89790, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "TELL"}
