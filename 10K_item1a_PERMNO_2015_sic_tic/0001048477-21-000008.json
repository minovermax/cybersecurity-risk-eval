{"cik": "1048477", "company": "BIOMARIN PHARMACEUTICAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently consider material, may impair our business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the value of our securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, quarantines, \u201cwork-from-home\u201d and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and extended shutdown of certain businesses around the world, including in many countries in which we operate. We experienced an impact on our product revenues and development programs in 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect that the outbreak will continue to adversely impact our financial results and our business generally. Ongoing and future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (or any future pandemic) on all aspects of our business and operations, including revenues, expenses, reserves and allowances, manufacturing, clinical trials and research and development costs, and the duration of such effects, are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. We anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will likely continue to have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely impact our product development programs, including preclinical study and clinical trial operations. We have been, and will likely continue to be, unable to initiate or continue conducting clinical trials as originally planned due to the prioritization of hospital resources toward the outbreak, difficulty in recruiting and retaining healthcare providers and staff due to their diversion toward treating COVID-19 patients or their heightened exposure to COVID-19, potential unwillingness of patients to enroll or continue in trials for fear of exposure to COVID-19 at sites, or the inability of patients to comply with clinical trial protocols as quarantines or travel restrictions impede patient movement or otherwise interrupt healthcare services. For example, we experienced delays in certain clinical trials and have had to reevaluate expected timelines for those trials. In addition, we rely on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations (CROs) and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the outbreak may affect their ability to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs or to travel to sites to perform work for us. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed, and may continue to postpone, necessary regulatory inspections and other interactions with regulators regarding our products in development, which could delay review or approval of our regulatory submissions.\nCOVID-19 could adversely affect our ability to source materials and supplies and successfully manufacture and distribute our product candidates and products. The outbreak could result in reduced operations of third-party suppliers of raw materials and supplies upon whom we rely or otherwise limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials and supplies necessary for production of our therapies. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are located in areas impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in delays or disruptions in our ability to produce product candidates and products. If we or any third party in our supply or distribution chain are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of required closures, staffing shortages, production slowdowns and disruptions in delivery systems, our operations may be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture and distribute our product candidates for clinical trials and research and development operations and our products for commercial sales.\nOur commercial operations have also been, and will likely continue to be, adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of our products are administered via infusions in a clinic or hospital setting and/or by a healthcare professional. Treating COVID-19 patients has become the priority for many healthcare facilities and workers, so it has become, and may continue to be, difficult for some of our patients to receive our therapies that are administered by infusion. Although we are working with our patient community and healthcare providers to find alternative arrangements where necessary, such as providing infusions at home, the revenue from doses of our products that are missed by patients and the lost revenue from delayed treatment starts for new patients will never be recouped. Moreover, some patients may choose to skip infusions because they do not want to risk exposure to COVID-19 by having a healthcare provider administer the therapy at a healthcare facility or at home. The pandemic has also hindered our ability to find new patients and start treating newly found patients, and it has limited our sales force\u2019s ability to promote our products to distributors, hospitals, clinics, doctors and pharmacies, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our workforce and the employees of companies with which we do business, thereby disrupting our business operations. We have implemented work-from-home policies for employees whose jobs do not require them to be onsite. Increased reliance by us and the companies with which we do business on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, increase cyber security risk, create data accessibility issues, increase the risk for communication disruptions, or otherwise disrupt or delay normal business operations. For our employees whose jobs require them to be onsite, we have taken precautions to avoid the spread of COVID-19 among our employees, but we cannot guarantee our workforce will not face an outbreak that could adversely impact our operations.\nWhile the long-term economic impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to predict, the widespread pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce our ability to access capital and could negatively affect our liquidity and the liquidity and stability of markets for our common stock and convertible notes. In addition, a recession, further market correction or depression resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock and convertible notes.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section, such as those relating to our conducting a significant amount of our sales and operations outside of the U.S., exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, our substantial indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and finance our operations, our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness and the volatility of our stock price.\nBecause the target patient populations for our products are small, we must achieve significant market share and maintain high per-patient prices for our products to achieve profitability.\nAll of our products target diseases with small patient populations. As a result, our per-patient prices must be relatively high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs and achieve profitability. For Brineura, Naglazyme and Vimizim in particular, we must market worldwide to achieve significant market penetration of the product. In addition, because the number of potential patients in each disease population is small, it is not only important to find patients who begin therapy to achieve significant market penetration of the product, but we also need to be able to maintain these patients on therapy for an extended period of time. Due to the expected costs of treatment for our products, we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient market share at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and manufacturing expenses.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for our products by third-party payers, the sales of our products would be adversely affected or there may be no commercially viable markets for our products.\nThe course of treatment for patients using our products is expensive. We expect patients to need treatment for extended periods, and for some products throughout the lifetimes of the patients. We expect that most families of patients will not be capable of paying for this treatment themselves. There will be no commercially viable market for our products without coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Additionally, even if there is a commercially viable market, if the level of reimbursement is below our expectations, our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nThird-party payers, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third-party payer, the insurance plan and other factors. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis.\nGovernment authorities and other third-party payers are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payers are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices as a condition of coverage, are using restrictive formularies and preferred drug lists to leverage greater discounts in competitive classes, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers in the U.S. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nWe cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize or will continue to be available for any product that we have commercialized and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval or continue to market any product that has already been commercialized.\nReimbursement in the European Union (EU) and many other territories must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. The timing to complete the negotiation process in each country is highly uncertain, and in some countries, we expect that it will exceed 12 months. Even after a price is negotiated, countries frequently request or require reductions to the price and other concessions over time.\nFor our future products, we will not know what the reimbursement rates will be until we are ready to market the product and we actually negotiate the rates. If we are unable to obtain sufficiently high reimbursement rates for our products, they may not be commercially viable or our future revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be adversely affected.\nOur competitors may develop, manufacture and market products that are more effective or less expensive than ours. They may also obtain regulatory approvals for their products faster than we can obtain them (including those products with orphan drug designation, which may prevent us from marketing our product entirely) or commercialize their products before we do. With respect to valoctocogene roxaparvovec, if the product candidate is approved, we will face a highly developed and competitive market for hemophilia A treatments. As we commercialize valoctocogene roxaparvovec, if approved, we may face intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies with extensive resources and established relationships in the hemophilia A community. If we do not compete successfully, our revenue would be adversely affected, and we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product.\nChanges in methods of treatment of disease could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect revenues.\nEven if our product candidates are approved, if doctors elect a course of treatment which does not include our products, this decision would reduce demand for our products and adversely affect revenues. For example, if gene therapy becomes widely used as a treatment of genetic diseases, the use of enzyme replacement therapy, such as Aldurazyme, Naglazyme, and Vimizim in MPS diseases, could be greatly reduced. Moreover, if we obtain regulatory approval for valoctocogene roxaparvovec, the commercial success of valoctocogene roxaparvovec will still depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients and healthcare payers of gene therapy products in general, and our product candidate in particular, as medically necessary, cost effective and safe. Changes in treatment method can be caused by the introduction of other companies\u2019 products or the development of new technologies or surgical procedures which may not directly compete with ours, but which have the effect of changing how doctors decide to treat a disease.\nIf we fail to develop new products and product candidates or compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint ventures, licenses or other collaboration opportunities, our ability to continue to expand our product pipeline and our growth and development would be impaired.\nOur future growth and development depend in part on our ability to successfully develop new products from our research and development activities. The development of biopharmaceutical products is very expensive and time intensive and involves a great degree of risk. The outcomes of research and development programs, especially for innovative biopharmaceuticals, are inherently uncertain and may not result in the commercialization of any products.\nOur competitors compete with us to attract organizations for acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing arrangements or other collaborations. To date, several of our former and current product programs have been acquired through acquisitions and several of our former and current product programs have been developed through licensing or collaborative arrangements, such as Aldurazyme, Kuvan and Naglazyme. These collaborations include licensing proprietary technology from, and other relationships with, academic research institutions. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to identify additional opportunities and to successfully enter into partnering or acquisition agreements for those opportunities. If our competitors successfully enter into partnering arrangements or license agreements with academic research institutions, we will then be precluded from pursuing those specific opportunities. Because each of these opportunities is unique, we may not be able to find a substitute. Several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have already established themselves in the field of genetic diseases. These companies have already begun many drug development programs, some of which may target diseases that we are also targeting, and have already entered into partnering and licensing arrangements with academic research institutions, reducing the pool of available opportunities.\nUniversities and public and private research institutions also compete with us. While these organizations primarily have educational or basic research objectives, they may develop proprietary technology and acquire patents that we may need for the development of our product candidates. We will attempt to license this proprietary technology, if available. These licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint venture and other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products and to continue to expand our product pipeline.\nThe sale of generic versions of Kuvan by generic manufacturers has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) for generic versions of branded drugs. We refer to this process as the ANDA process. The ANDA process permits competitor companies to obtain marketing approval for a drug with the same active ingredient as a branded drug, but does not generally require the conduct and submission of clinical efficacy studies for the generic product. In place of such clinical studies, an ANDA applicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its product is bioequivalent to the branded product.\nPursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act, companies were permitted to file ANDA applications for proposed generic versions of Kuvan at any time after December 2011. We own several patents that cover Kuvan, and we have listed those patents in conjunction with that product in the FDA\u2019s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book).\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act requires an ANDA applicant seeking FDA approval of its proposed generic product prior to the expiration of our Orange Book-listed patents to certify that the applicant believes that our patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug for which the application has been submitted (a paragraph IV certification) and notify us of such certification (a paragraph IV notice). Upon receipt of a paragraph IV notice, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows us, with proper basis, to bring an action for patent infringement against the ANDA filer, asking that the proposed generic product not be approved until after our patents expire. If we commence a lawsuit within 45 days from receipt of the paragraph IV notice, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a 30-month stay, during which time the FDA cannot finally approve the generic\u2019s application. If the litigation is resolved in favor of the ANDA applicant during the 30-month stay period, the stay is lifted and the FDA may approve the ANDA if it is otherwise ready for approval. The discovery, trial and appeals process in such a lawsuit is costly, time consuming, and may result in generic competition if the ANDA applicant prevails.\nBetween 2014 and 2016 we received paragraph IV notice letters from two pharmaceutical companies notifying us that each had filed ANDAs seeking approval of proposed generic versions of Kuvan. We filed lawsuits alleging patent infringement against each company, and between 2015 and 2017 we entered into settlement agreements with the companies that resolved the patent litigation in the U.S. The settlement agreements granted the companies non-exclusive licenses to our Kuvan-related patents to allow them to market generic versions of sapropterin dihydrochloride in the U.S. for the indications approved for Kuvan beginning on October 1, 2020, or earlier under certain circumstances. Generic versions of Kuvan first became available in the U.S. in October 2020, and as expected, our U.S. sales of Kuvan in the fourth quarter of 2020 significantly declined as compared to prior periods. We expect that the continued availability of generic versions of sapropterin dihydrochloride in the U.S. will continue to adversely affect our U.S. sales of Kuvan.\nAny future ANDA or related legal proceeding could have an adverse impact on our stock price, and litigation to enforce our patents has, and is likely to continue to, cost a substantial amount and require significant management attention. If the patents covering Kuvan and its use are not upheld in litigation, or if any ANDA filer we bring suit against is found to not infringe our asserted patents, the resulting generic competition following the expiration of regulatory exclusivity would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. Moreover, generic competition following the settlements described above could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nWe also face generic competition for Kuvan in certain non-U.S. countries, and there is a process equivalent to the ANDA process under Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC in the EU. Our ability to successfully market and sell Kuvan in many countries in which we operate is based upon patent rights or certain regulatory forms of exclusivity, or both. The scope of our patent rights and regulatory exclusivity for Kuvan vary from country to country and are dependent on the availability of meaningful legal remedies in each country. If our patent rights and regulatory exclusivity for Kuvan are successfully challenged, expire, or otherwise terminate in a particular country, the resulting generic competition could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in many cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nRegulatory Risks\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval to commercially market and sell our product candidates, or if approval of our product candidates is delayed, we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these product candidates, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will increase.\nWe must obtain regulatory approval to market and sell our product candidates. For example, in the U.S., we must obtain FDA approval for each product candidate that we intend to commercialize, and in Europe we must obtain approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The FDA and EMA approval processes are typically lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain. Accordingly, there are no assurances that we will obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that approval of one of our product candidates by one regulatory agency will mean that other agencies will also approve the same product candidate. Similarly, regulatory authorities may approve a product candidate for\nfewer or more limited indications than requested. In addition, regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have had fewer interactions with regulatory authorities outside the U.S. and the EU as compared to our interactions with the FDA and EMA. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA or EMA approval. Moreover, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA or EMA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more non-U.S. regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other non-U.S. countries or by the FDA or EMA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. The non-U.S. regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA or EMA approval. We may not obtain non-U.S. regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and even if we file, we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market.\nBecause of the risks and uncertainties in pharmaceutical development, our product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval. We also rely on independent third-party CROs to file some of our non-U.S. marketing applications and important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If we fail to adequately manage our CROs, if the CRO elects to prioritize work on our projects below other projects or if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, the filing of our applications may be delayed.\nAlthough the FDA and the EMA have programs to facilitate expedited development and accelerated approval processes, the timelines agreed under legislative goals or mandated by regulations are subject to the possibility of substantial delays. In addition, the FDA, the EMA and other international regulatory authorities have substantial discretion over the approval process for pharmaceutical products. These regulatory agencies may not agree that we have demonstrated the requisite level of product safety and efficacy to grant approval and may require additional data. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to market and sell those product candidates, which would have a negative effect on our business and financial condition.\nWith respect to valoctocogene roxaparvovec, we may experience challenges specific to gene therapy that cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that cannot be solved. Although numerous companies are currently advancing gene therapy product candidates through clinical trials, the FDA has only approved a very small number of vector-based gene therapy products thus far. Moreover, there are very few approved gene therapy products outside the U.S. As a result, it is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for valoctocogene roxaparvovec in any jurisdiction. Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products are still evolving and may continue to change in the future. For example, in October 2020, it was reported that the Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the center of the FDA responsible for reviewing marketing applications for gene therapies, stated that the FDA will assess the importance of durability of effect differently for a gene therapy that treats a disease that has no other available therapies versus a condition for which there are multiple approved treatments. Regulatory review agencies and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our treatment candidate or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. For example, on August 18, 2020 the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to our BLA for valoctocogene roxaparvovec for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A. In the CRL, the FDA introduced a new request for two-year follow-up safety and efficacy data on all study participants from our ongoing Phase 3 study of valoctocogene roxaparvovec. The trial will not complete two years of follow-up until November 2021. Continued delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring valoctocogene roxaparvovec to market could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition. Even if we do obtain regulatory approval, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy arising in the future could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting sale of our product.\nIn addition, some of our product candidates are intended to be used in combination with a delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products or medical devices may be regulated as \u201ccombination products\u201d in the U.S. A combination product generally is defined as a product consisting of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic or device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by the FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product. The determination whether a product is a combination product or two separately regulated products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. Our product candidates intended for use with such devices, or expanded indications that we may seek for our products used with such devices, may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving approval if the devices do not gain and/or maintain their own regulatory approvals or clearances. Where approval of the drug or biologic product and device is sought under a single application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay approval. The FDA review process and criteria are not well-established areas, which could also lead to delays in the approval process. In addition, because these delivery devices are provided by unaffiliated third-party companies, we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to obtain regulatory approval and to\nmaintain their own regulatory compliance. Failure of third-party companies to assist in the approval process or to maintain their own regulatory compliance could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates, or limit our ability to sell a product once it is approved.\nFrom time to time during the development and regulatory approval process for our products and product candidates, we engage in discussions with the FDA and comparable international regulatory authorities regarding our development programs, including discussions about the regulatory requirements for approval. As part of these discussions, we sometimes seek advice in the design of our clinical programs from various regulatory agencies globally, but we do not always follow such guidance. This increases the chance of adverse regulatory actions, but we try to always provide appropriate scientific evidence to support approval. For example, when the FDA accepted our new drug application for vosoritide in late 2020, the agency reiterated its position raised during the vosoritide Pediatric Advisory Committee and Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee held in May 2018, recommending two, two-year placebo-controlled trials in different age groups. Although our vosoritide clinical program does not meet every element of the FDA\u2019s recommendation, we designed our studies of vosoritide in a manner that we believe can demonstrate efficacy and safety of the product candidate for the target patient population. However, the FDA may ultimately disagree with our position that our vosoritide trials support regulatory approval. Moreover, sometimes different regulatory agencies provide different or conflicting advice. While we attempt to harmonize the advice we receive from multiple regulatory authorities, it is not always practical to do so. Also, we may choose not to harmonize conflicting advice when harmonization would significantly delay clinical trial data or is otherwise inappropriate. If we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and comply with the inquiries and requests of the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, the approval of our product candidates may be delayed and their value may be reduced.\nAny product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain approval in the future, is subject to, or will be subject to, extensive ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities, and if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, we may be subject to penalties, we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of such products, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nAldurazyme, Brineura, Kuvan, Naglazyme and Vimizim have received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed and sold in the U.S., the EU and certain other countries, and Palynziq has received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed in the U.S. and the EU. Any product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain regulatory approval in the future, along with the manufacturing processes and practices, post-approval clinical research, product labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, are subject to continual requirements of, and review by, the FDA, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, import and export requirements and record keeping.\nAn example of the ongoing regulatory requirements our products are subject to is the Palynziq Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program. In the U.S., Palynziq is only available through the REMS program, which is required by the FDA to mitigate the risk of anaphylaxis while using the product. Notable requirements of our REMS program include the following:\n\u2022prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the REMS program and completing training;\n\u2022prescribers must prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine with Palynziq;\n\u2022pharmacies must be certified with the REMS program and must dispense Palynziq only to patients who are authorized to receive it;\n\u2022patients must enroll in the REMS program and be educated about the risk of anaphylaxis by a certified prescriber to ensure they understand the risks and benefits of treatment with Palynziq; and\n\u2022patients must have auto-injectable epinephrine available at all times while taking Palynziq.\nFailure of prescribers, pharmacies or patients to enroll in our REMS program or to successfully complete and comply with its requirements may result in regulatory action from the FDA or decreased sales of Palynziq. The restrictions and requirements under our REMS program, as well as potential changes to these restrictions and requirements in the future, subject us to increased risks and uncertainties, any of which could harm our business. The requirement for a REMS program can materially affect the potential market for and profitability of a drug. We cannot predict whether the FDA will request, seek to require or ultimately require modifications to, or impose additional requirements on, the Palynziq REMS program, or whether the FDA will permit modifications to the Palynziq REMS program that we consider warranted. Any modifications required or rejected by the FDA could make it more difficult or expensive for us to distribute Palynziq in the U.S., impair the safety profile of Palynziq, disrupt continuity of care for Palynziq patients and/or negatively affect sales of Palynziq.\nMoreover, promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs, including biologics, are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product's approved labeling. In particular, a\nproduct may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved.\nMoreover, if original FDA approval for one of our product candidates is granted via the accelerated approval pathway, we will be required to conduct a post-marketing confirmatory trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit in support of full approval. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study with due diligence could result in the withdrawal of the FDA\u2019s marketing approval for a product candidate. In addition, the FDA often requires post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of products. The FDA, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory agencies may condition approval of our product candidates on the completion of such post-marketing clinical studies. These post-marketing studies may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects or may present a risk to the patient.\nDiscovery after approval of previously unknown problems with any of our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned trials;\n\u2022restrictions on product manufacturing processes;\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing of a product;\n\u2022restrictions on product distribution;\n\u2022requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022untitled or warning letters or other adverse publicity;\n\u2022withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022recall of products;\n\u2022refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022product seizure;\n\u2022fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022injunctions; or\n\u2022imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIf such regulatory actions are taken, our value and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if the FDA, the EMA or any other comparable international regulatory agency withdraws its approval of a product, we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of that product in the relevant jurisdiction, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased. Accordingly, we continue to expend significant time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance, post-marketing studies and quality control.\nTo obtain regulatory approval to market our products, preclinical studies and costly and lengthy clinical trials are required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain. Likewise, preliminary, initial or interim data from clinical trials should be considered carefully and with caution because the final data may be materially different from the preliminary, initial or interim data, particularly as more patient data become available.\nAs part of the drug development process we must conduct, at our own expense, preclinical studies in the laboratory, including studies in animals, and clinical trials on humans for each product candidate. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that regulatory authorities require varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition the drug is being developed to address and regulations applicable to the particular drug. Generally, new drugs for diseases or conditions that affect larger patient populations, are less severe, or are treatable by alternative strategies must be validated through additional preclinical and clinical trials and/or clinical trials with higher enrollments. With respect to our early stage product candidates, we may need to perform multiple preclinical studies using various doses and formulations before we can begin clinical trials, which could result in delays to our development timeline. Furthermore, even if we obtain favorable results in preclinical studies, the results in humans may be significantly different. After we have conducted preclinical studies, we must demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and efficacious for use in the targeted human patients in order to receive regulatory approval for commercial sale. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and favorable data from interim analyses do not ensure the final results of a trial\nwill be favorable. From time to time, we have and may in the future publish or report preliminary, initial or interim data from our clinical trials, such as the data we have announced from the GENEr-8-1 study for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. Preliminary, initial or interim data from our clinical trials may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and/or more patient data become available. In this regard, such data may show initial evidence of clinical benefit, but as patients continue to be followed and more patient data become available, there is a risk that any therapeutic effects will not be durable in patients and/or will decrease over time or cease entirely. Preliminary, initial or interim data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from such preliminary, initial or interim data. As a result, preliminary, initial or interim data should be considered carefully and with caution until the final data are available.\nProduct candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials, or despite having favorable data in connection with an interim analysis. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Also, as noted above, we do not always follow the advice of regulatory authorities or comply with all of their requests regarding the design of our clinical programs. In those cases, we may choose a development program that is inconsistent with the advice of regulatory authorities, which may limit the jurisdictions where we conduct clinical trials and/or adversely affect our ability to obtain approval in those jurisdictions where we do not follow the regulatory advice.\nAdverse or inconclusive clinical results could stop us from obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials include:\n\u2022slow or insufficient patient enrollment;\n\u2022slow recruitment of, and completion of necessary institutional approvals at, clinical sites;\n\u2022budgetary constraints or prohibitively high clinical trial costs;\n\u2022longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy;\n\u2022lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate;\n\u2022adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients, including immune reactions;\n\u2022lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested;\n\u2022availability of competitive therapies to treat the same indication as our product candidates;\n\u2022regulatory requests for additional clinical trials or preclinical studies;\n\u2022deviations in standards for Good Clinical Practice (GCP); and\n\u2022disputes with or disruptions in our relationships with clinical trial partners, including CROs, clinical laboratories, clinical sites, and principal investigators.\nMoreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services reportable to the FDA or other regulatory authority. If the FDA or other regulatory authority concludes that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest, the FDA or other regulatory authority may question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized.\nSimilar rules governing clinical trials to those in place in the United States apply in the EU and the U.K. Following the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, and the end of the transition period that was in place until the end of 2020, clinical trials that take place in the U.K. are seen as trials that have taken place in a \u201cthird country\u201d and will only be considered during the course of a marketing authorization application if they are carried out on a basis that is in line with the regulations governing clinical trials in the EU. Clinical trials in the EU must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Directive, as implemented in national law by individual member states, and applicable good clinical practice standards. The EU Clinical Trials Directive is due to be replaced with the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU CTR) at the end of 2021. Should the U.K. not seek to align its regulations governing clinical trials with the EU CTR then trials that take place in the U.K. may carry less weight than they currently do when applying for a marketing authorization in the EU.\nGovernment price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe expect that coverage and reimbursement may be increasingly restricted in all the markets in which we sell our products. The escalating cost of healthcare has led to increased pressure on the healthcare industry to reduce costs. In particular, drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies has recently come under increased scrutiny and continues to be subject to intense political and public debate in the U.S. and abroad. Governmental and private third-party payers have proposed healthcare reforms and cost reductions. A number of federal and state proposals to control the cost of healthcare, including the cost of drug\ntreatments, have been made in the U.S. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed bills and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, Congress and the executive branch have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. In some international markets, the government controls the pricing, which can affect the profitability of drugs. Current government regulations and possible future legislation regarding healthcare may affect coverage and reimbursement for medical treatment by third-party payers, which may render our products not commercially viable or may adversely affect our future revenues and gross margins.\nInternational operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or mandatory price cuts or reduce the value of our intellectual property portfolio. As part of these cost containment measures, some countries have imposed and continue to propose revenue caps limiting the annual volume of sales of our products. Some of these caps are significantly below the actual demand in certain countries, and if the trend regarding revenue caps continues, our future revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments. However, future price controls or other changes in pricing regulation or negative publicity related to our product pricing or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products or our sales volume, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nGovernment healthcare reform could increase our costs and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. In the U.S., there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the PPACA) is a sweeping measure intended to, among other things, expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. Several provisions of the law have affected us and increased certain of our costs. Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruling that that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and to determine the constitutionality of the PPACA in its entirety, although it is unclear when a decision will be made. It is also unclear how such litigation will impact the PPACA and our business. In addition, other legislative changes have been adopted since the PPACA was enacted. Some of these changes have resulted in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.\nWe anticipate that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future in the U.S. or abroad, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the reimbursement our customers may receive for our products. Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in countries worldwide over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products.\nIn the U.S., there have been several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, during the former Trump administration there were multiple executive orders issued, initiatives implemented and calls for legislation form Congress to reduce drug prices, increase competition and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs for patients. The likelihood of implementation of any of the former Trump administration healthcare reform initiatives is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Biden administration and its implementation of a regulatory freeze. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. In addition, individual states in the U.S. have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLikewise, in many EU countries, legislators and other policymakers continue to propose and implement healthcare cost-containing measures in response to the increased attention being paid to healthcare costs in the EU. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our products and any approved product candidates or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental and private third-party payers, may increase the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies or may facilitate the introduction of generic competition with respect to our products. Further, an increasing number of EU countries and other non-U.S. countries use prices for medicinal products established in other\ncountries as \u201creference prices\u201d to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. If the price of one of our products decreases substantially in a reference price country, it could impact the price for that product in other countries. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of our products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement for our products in some countries, we may be required to conduct clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies.\nLegally mandated price controls on payment amounts by governmental and private third-party payers or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nFor more information regarding government healthcare reform, see \u201cGovernment Regulation - Health Reform\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for some of our products, our competitors may obtain approval to sell the same drugs to treat the same conditions and our revenues will be reduced.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have developed and may in the future develop some drugs that may be eligible for FDA and EU orphan drug designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S. In the EU, orphan drug designation is available if a sponsor can establish: that the medicine is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, which is equivalent to around 250,000 people or fewer or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. The company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the stated condition for a period of seven years. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. In addition, the FDA may approve another drug during a period of orphan drug exclusivity if the second drug is found to be clinically superior to the first drug. In the EU, a ten-year period of market exclusivity (extendable to twelve years for medicines that have complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006) is available. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity may be lost in the EU if a manufacturer is unable to supply sufficient quantities and marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the criteria for its designation as an orphan medicine are no longer satisfied, for example if the original orphan medicinal product has become sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Because the extent and scope of patent protection for some of our products is limited, orphan drug designation is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. For eligible products, we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the Orphan Drug Act to maintain a competitive position. If we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our products that do not have broad patent protection, our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition and our revenues will be reduced.\nEven though we have obtained orphan drug designation for certain of our product candidates and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for our future product candidates, due to the uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval of certain product candidates until the competitor product\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity period expires. Moreover, with respect to certain biologics and gene therapies, it is uncertain how similarity between product candidates designed to treat the same rare disease or condition may affect such product candidates\u2019 orphan drug exclusivities. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition and the same drug can be approved for different conditions and potentially used off-label in the orphan indication. Even after an orphan drug is approved and granted orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer or more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway.\nOur Aldurazyme, Brineura, Naglazyme, Palynziq and Vimizim products are regulated by the FDA as biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDC Act) and the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act). Biologics require the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the U.S. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation\nAct of 2009 (BPCIA) created a regulatory pathway under the PHS Act for the abbreviated approval of biological products that are demonstrated to be \u201cbiosimilar\u201d or \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with an FDA-approved biological product. A similar abridged marketing authorization process is available to biosimilar products in the EU. In order to meet the standard of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. The BPCIA establishes a period of 12 years of exclusivity for reference products. In Europe, a medicinal product containing a new active substance benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which biosimilar applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such biosimilar products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. Our products approved under BLAs in the U.S. or Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) in Europe, as well as products in development that may be approved under those regimes in the future, could be reference products for biosimilar marketing applications.\nChanges in funding for the FDA, the EMA and other government agencies or government shutdowns could hinder the ability of such agencies to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nChanges in funding levels of government agencies can affect their ability to hire and retain key personnel and carry out their normal functions that support our business. For example, the ability of the FDA to timely review and approve INDs or marketing authorizations for our product candidates may be hindered by a lack of resources and qualified personnel. In addition, funding of other government agencies on which our operations rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political budget process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nGovernment shutdowns could also impact the ability of government agencies to function normally and support our operations. For example, the U.S. federal government has shut down repeatedly since 1980, including for a period of 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018. During a shutdown, certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough key personnel and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec\nOur valoctocogene roxaparvovec program is based on a gene therapy approach, which, as a novel technology, presents additional development and treatment risks in relation to our other, more traditional drug development programs.\nIn addition to the risks set forth in this Risk Factors section associated with developing more traditional pharmaceutical drugs, there are additional, unique development and treatment risks associated with gene therapy products like our product candidate valoctocogene roxaparvovec. The goal of gene therapy is to be able to correct an inborn genetic defect through one-time administration of therapeutic genetic material containing non-defective gene copies. The gene copies are designed to reside permanently in a patient, allowing the patient to produce an essential protein or ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule that a healthy person would normally produce. There is a risk, however, that the new gene copies will produce too little or too much of the desired protein or RNA. Although a one-time administration of a gene therapy product like our product candidate valoctocogene roxaparvovec is intended to correct an inborn genetic defect for the entire lifetime of a patient, there is a risk that the therapeutic effect will not be durable and production of the desired protein or RNA will decrease over time or cease entirely. Because the treatment is irreversible, there may be challenges in managing side effects, particularly those caused by potential overproduction of the desired protein. Adverse effects would not be able to be reversed or relieved by stopping dosing, and we may have to develop additional clinical safety procedures. Furthermore, because the new gene copies are designed to reside permanently in a patient, there is a risk that they will disrupt other normal biological molecules and processes, including other healthy genes, and we may not learn the nature and magnitude of these side effects until long after clinical trials have been completed.\nAs compared to our other, more traditional products, our gene therapy product candidate valoctocogene roxaparvovec, if approved, may present additional problems with respect to the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement and acceptance of the product candidate.\nIn addition to the risks set forth in this Risk Factors section associated with commercializing more traditional pharmaceutical drugs, there are additional, unique commercial risks associated with gene therapy products like our product candidate valoctocogene roxaparvovec. Due to the relative novelty of gene therapy and the potential to provide extended duration therapeutic treatment with a one-time administration, we face uncertainty with respect to the pricing, coverage and reimbursement of valoctocogene roxaparvovec, if approved. In order to recover our research and development costs and commercialize this one-time treatment on a profitable basis, we expect the cost of a single administration of valoctocogene roxaparvovec to be substantial. Therefore, we expect that coverage and reimbursement by governments and other third-party payers will be essential for the vast majority of patients to be able to afford valoctocogene roxaparvovec. Accordingly, sales of valoctocogene roxaparvovec, if\napproved, will depend substantially, both domestically and internationally, on the extent to which its cost will be paid by third-party payers. Even if coverage is provided, the reimbursement amounts approved by third-party payers may not be high enough to allow us to realize sufficient revenues from our investment in the development of valoctocogene roxaparvovec.\nWe also face uncertainty as to whether gene therapy will gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for valoctocogene roxaparvovec, the commercial success of valoctocogene roxaparvovec will depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients and third-party payers of gene therapy products in general, and our product candidate in particular, as medically necessary, cost-effective and safe. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians prescribing our product candidate in lieu of existing treatments they are already familiar with and for which greater clinical data may be available. Moreover, physicians and patients may delay acceptance of valoctocogene roxaparvovec until the product candidate has been on the market for a certain amount of time. Negative public opinion or more restrictive government regulations could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition and may delay or impair the successful commercialization of, and demand for, valoctocogene roxaparvovec\nWe have implemented a data access plan for valoctocogene roxaparvovec, which restricts our management\u2019s review of emerging data from these trials. Without access to ongoing data, management does not have the ability to adjust the trials based on such emerging data, which could adversely impact the ultimate outcome of these trials.\nIn order to preserve the scientific integrity of the valoctocogene roxaparvovec trials and to allow us to only report on data at intervals that we believe will be meaningful to investors, we have implemented a data access plan related to the ongoing open label trials, which is designed to significantly mirror blinded trials. Pursuant to this plan, the ongoing emerging data are generally not collected by us, with the exception that certain specific data points are collected and reviewed by a small group of medical personnel monitoring and managing the trial, and then, only to the extent necessary to allow them to perform their monitoring responsibilities. As we disclose and publicly discuss prior data from these trials, such discussions do not incorporate any of the currently emerging data that are being collected and reviewed by personnel monitoring the trial and, accordingly, this prior data may differ significantly from more recent data that are only available to such personnel. Further, because our management does not have access to any of the ongoing data and does not have the ability to adjust the trials based on such emerging data, the data access plan could adversely impact the ultimate outcome of the trials.\nFinancial and Financing Risks\nIf we continue to incur operating losses or are unable to sustain positive cash flows for a period longer than anticipated, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nSince we began operations in March 1997, we have been engaged in substantial research and development and capital investments, and we have operated at a net loss for each year since our inception, with the exception of 2008, 2010 and 2020. Our future profitability and cash flows depend on our marketing and selling of our products, the receipt of regulatory approval of our product candidates, our ability to successfully manufacture and market any products, either by ourselves or jointly with others, our spending on our development programs, the impact of any possible future business development transactions and other risks set forth in this Risk Factors section. The extent of our future losses and the timing of profitability and positive cash flows are highly uncertain. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability and positive cash flows on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected and we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.4 billion and debt obligations of $1.1 billion (undiscounted), which consisted of our 0.599% senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2024 (the 2024 Notes) and our 1.25% senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2027 (the 2027 Notes). The 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes (collectively, the Notes), if not converted, will be required to be repaid in cash at maturity in August 2024 and May 2027, respectively. We will need cash not only to pay the ongoing interest due on the Notes during their term, but also to repay the principal amount of the Notes if not converted.\nIn January 2016, we terminated our License and Commercialization Agreement with Ares Trading, S.A. (Merck Serono). Pursuant to the Termination and Transition Agreement related to Kuvan and the Termination Agreement related to Palynziq, we are obligated to make certain payments to Merck Serono if sales and development milestones are achieved. The remaining milestone payments that may become payable include up to a maximum of \u20ac60 million, in cash, if future sales milestones are met with respect to Kuvan and Palynziq.\nWe may require additional financing to fund the repayment of the Notes, future milestone payments and our future operations, including the commercialization of our products and product candidates currently under development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and potential licenses and acquisitions. We may be unable to raise additional financing due to a variety of factors, including our financial condition, the status of our product programs, and the general condition of the financial markets. If\nwe fail to raise any necessary additional financing we may have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs and our financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of capital for our operations for the foreseeable future. The amount of capital we will need depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to successfully market and sell our products;\n\u2022the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes, including quality systems, and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities the progress and success of our preclinical studies and clinical trials (including studies and the manufacture of materials);\n\u2022the timing, number, size and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and the costs of post-marketing studies which may be required by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022the progress of research programs carried out by us;\n\u2022our possible achievement of development and commercial milestones under agreements with third parties, such as the Kuvan and Palynziq milestones under the termination agreements with Merck Serono;\n\u2022any changes made to, or new developments in, our existing collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish;\n\u2022Sanofi Genzyme\u2019s (Genzyme) ability to continue to successfully commercialize Aldurazyme; and\n\u2022whether our convertible debt is converted to common stock in the future.\nMoreover, our fixed expenses such as rent, license payments, interest expense and other contractual commitments are substantial and may increase in the future. These fixed expenses may increase because we may enter into:\n\u2022additional licenses and collaborative agreements;\n\u2022additional contracts for product manufacturing; and\n\u2022additional financing facilities or arrangements.\nWe will need to raise additional funds from equity or debt securities, loans or collaborative agreements if we are unable to satisfy our liquidity requirements. The sale of additional securities will result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Furthermore, additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. This could result in the delay, reduction or termination of our research, which could harm our business.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital, and/or increase our borrowing costs, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1.1 billion (undiscounted) principal amount of indebtedness, including $495.0 million (undiscounted) principal amount of indebtedness under the 2024 Notes and $600.0 million (undiscounted) principal amount of indebtedness under the 2027 Notes. In October 2018, we also entered into an unsecured credit agreement (the 2018 Credit Facility) with Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent, swingline lender and a lender, Citibank N.A. as letter of credit issuer and each of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citibank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, providing up to $200.0 million in revolving loan commitments. Our indebtedness may:\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn addition, the 2018 Credit Facility contains, and any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. If we default under the 2018 Credit Facility, the outstanding borrowings thereunder could become immediately due and payable, the 2018 Credit Facility lenders could refuse to permit additional borrowings under the facility, or it could lead to defaults under agreements governing our current or future indebtedness, including the indentures governing the Notes. If we default under any of the Notes, such Notes could become immediately due and payable and it could lead to defaults under the other Notes and/or the 2018 Credit Facility.\nIn addition, our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.\nOur outstanding indebtedness consists primarily of the 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes, which, if not converted, will be required to be repaid in cash at maturity in August 2024 and May 2027, respectively. While we could seek to obtain additional third-party financing to pay for any amounts due in cash upon maturity of the Notes, we cannot be sure that such third-party financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nIn addition, we also may borrow up to $200.0 million in revolving loans under the 2018 Credit Facility, which would be required to be repaid in cash at maturity on October 19, 2021.\nManufacturing Risks\nIf we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nBefore we can begin commercial manufacture of our products, regulatory authorities must approve marketing applications that identify manufacturing facilities operated by us or our contract manufacturers that have passed regulatory inspection and manufacturing processes that are acceptable to the regulatory authorities. In addition, our pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to scheduled and unannounced inspection by the FDA and international regulatory authorities, before and after product approval, to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMP and other regulations. Our manufacturing facility in the U.S. has been approved by the FDA and the European Commission (EC) for the manufacture of Palynziq, and it has been approved by the FDA, the EC, and health agencies in other countries for the manufacture of Aldurazyme, Brineura, Naglazyme and Vimizim. Our manufacturing facility in Shanbally, Cork, Ireland has been approved by the FDA, the EC, and health agencies in other countries for the manufacture of Vimizim, and it has been approved by the FDA and the EMA as a formulated bulk drug substance manufacturing and quality control facility for Brineura. In addition, our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities involved with the manufacture of our products have also been inspected and approved by various regulatory authorities. Although we are not involved in the day-to-day operations of our contract manufacturers, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMP regulations.\nDue to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture our products and product candidates, we may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner. For the same reason, any potential third-party manufacturer of our products or our product candidates may be unable to comply with cGMP regulations in a cost-effective manner and may be unable to initially or continue to pass a federal or international regulatory inspection.\nIf we, or third-party manufacturers with whom we contract, are unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, we may be subject to delay of approval of our product candidates, warning or untitled letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and maintain manufacturing processes for our product candidates to produce sufficient quantities at acceptable costs, we may be unable to support a clinical trial or be forced to terminate a program, or if we are unable to produce sufficient quantities of our products at acceptable costs, we may be unable to meet commercial demand, lose potential revenue, have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program.\nDue to the complexity of manufacturing our product candidates and products, we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities. Our inability to produce enough of our product candidate at acceptable costs may result in the delay or termination of development programs. With respect to our commercial portfolio, we may not be able to manufacture our products successfully with a commercially viable process or at a scale large enough to support their respective commercial markets or at acceptable margins.\nThe development of commercially viable manufacturing processes typically is very difficult to achieve and is often very expensive and may require extended periods of time. Changes in manufacturing processes (including manufacturing cell lines), equipment or facilities (including moving manufacturing from one of our facilities to another one of our facilities or a third-party facility, or from a third-party facility to one of our facilities) may require us to complete clinical trials to receive regulatory approval of any manufacturing modifications.\nWith respect to valoctocogene roxaparvovec, gene therapy products are relatively novel and complex and have only in limited cases been manufactured at scales sufficient for pivotal trials and commercialization. Few pharmaceutical contract manufacturers specialize in gene therapy products and those that do are still developing appropriate processes and facilities for large-scale production. We invested a considerable amount of capital building our own commercial gene therapy manufacturing facility, which may be subject to significant impairment if our gene therapy programs are unsuccessful. As we develop, seek to optimize and operate the valoctocogene roxaparvovec manufacturing process, we will likely face technical and scientific challenges, considerable capital costs, and potential difficulty in recruiting and hiring experienced, qualified personnel. There may also be unexpected technical or operational issues during clinical or commercial manufacturing campaigns. As a result, we could experience manufacturing delays that prevent us from completing our clinical studies in a timely manner, if at all, or commercializing valoctocogene roxaparvovec on a profitable basis, if at all.\nAlso, we may be required to demonstrate product comparability between a biological product made after a manufacturing change and the product made before implementation of the change through additional types of analytical and functional testing or may have to complete additional clinical studies. If we contract for manufacturing services with an unproven process, our contractor is subject to the same uncertainties, high standards and regulatory controls, and may therefore experience difficulty if further process development is necessary.\nEven a developed manufacturing process can encounter difficulties. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including human error, mechanical breakdowns, problems with raw materials and cell banks, malfunctions of internal information technology systems, and other events that cannot always be prevented or anticipated. Many of the processes include biological systems, which add significant complexity, as compared to chemical synthesis. We expect that, from time to time, consistent with biotechnology industry expectations, certain production lots will fail to produce product that meets our quality control release acceptance criteria. To date, our historical failure rates for all of our product programs, including Aldurazyme, Brineura, Naglazyme, Palynziq and Vimizim, have been within our expectations, which are based on industry norms. If the failure rate increased substantially, we could experience increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense investigating the cause and, depending upon the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.\nIn order to produce product within our time and cost parameters, we must continue to produce product within our expected success rate and yield expectations. Because of the complexity of our manufacturing processes, it may be difficult or impossible for us to determine the cause of any particular lot failure and we must effectively take corrective action in response to any failure in a timely manner.\nWe currently rely on third parties for portions of the manufacture of each of our commercial products. If those manufacturers are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or satisfy demand outside of or in excess of the contractual obligations, we may be unable to meet demand for these products or sell these products at all and we may lose potential revenue. Further, the availability of suitable contract manufacturing capacity at scheduled or optimum times is not certain.\nIn addition, our manufacturing processes subject us to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes resulting from their use. We incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations.\nSupply interruptions may disrupt our inventory levels and the availability of our products and product candidates and cause delays in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, or harm our business by reducing our revenues.\nWe depend on single-source suppliers for critical raw materials and a limited number of manufacturing facilities to manufacture our finished products and product candidates. Numerous factors could cause interruptions in the supply or manufacture of our products and product candidates, including:\n\u2022timing, scheduling and prioritization of production by our contract manufacturers or a breach of our agreements by our contract manufacturers;\n\u2022labor interruptions;\n\u2022changes in our sources for manufacturing;\n\u2022the timing and delivery of shipments;\n\u2022our failure to locate and obtain replacement suppliers and manufacturers as needed on a timely basis; and\n\u2022conditions affecting the cost and availability of raw materials.\nIf one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails or refuses to supply us with necessary raw materials or finished products or product candidates on a timely basis or at all, it would take a significant amount of time and expense to qualify a new supplier or manufacturer. We may not be able to obtain active ingredients or finished products from new suppliers or manufacturers on acceptable terms and at reasonable prices, or at all.\nAny interruption in the supply of finished products could hinder our ability to distribute finished products to meet commercial demand and adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nWith respect to our product candidates, production of product is necessary to perform clinical trials and successful registration batches are necessary to file for approval to commercially market and sell product candidates. Delays in obtaining clinical material or registration batches could adversely impact our clinical trials and delay regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nIf our Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales Agreement with Genzyme were terminated, we could be prevented from continuing to commercialize Aldurazyme or our ability to successfully commercialize Aldurazyme would be delayed or diminished.\nEither party may terminate the Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales Agreement (the MMS Agreement) between Genzyme and us related to Aldurazyme for specified reasons, including if the other party is in material breach of the MMS Agreement, has experienced a change of control, as such term is defined in the MMS Agreement, or has declared bankruptcy and also is in breach of the MMS Agreement. Although we are not currently in breach of the MMS Agreement, there is a risk that either party could breach the MMS Agreement in the future. Either party may also terminate the MMS Agreement upon one-year prior written notice for any reason.\nIf the MMS Agreement is terminated for breach, the breaching party will transfer its interest in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC to the non-breaching party, and the non-breaching party will pay a specified buyout amount for the breaching party\u2019s interest in Aldurazyme and in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC. If we are the breaching party, we would lose our rights to Aldurazyme and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals. If the MMS Agreement is terminated without cause, the non-terminating party would have the option, exercisable for one year, to buy out the terminating party\u2019s interest in Aldurazyme and in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC at a specified buyout amount. If such option is not exercised, all rights to Aldurazyme will be sold and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC will be dissolved. In the event of termination of the buyout option without exercise by the non-terminating party as described above, all right and title to Aldurazyme is to be sold to the highest bidder, with the proceeds to be split between Genzyme and us in accordance with our percentage interest in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC.\nIf the MMS Agreement is terminated by either party because the other party declared bankruptcy, the terminating party would be obligated to buy out the other party and would obtain all rights to Aldurazyme exclusively. If the MMS Agreement is terminated by a party because the other party experienced a change of control, the terminating party shall notify the other party, the offeree, of its intent to buy out the offeree\u2019s interest in Aldurazyme and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC for a stated amount set by the terminating party at its discretion. The offeree must then either accept this offer or agree to buy the terminating party\u2019s interest in Aldurazyme and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC on those same terms. The party who buys out the other party would then have exclusive worldwide rights to Aldurazyme. The Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement between us and Genzyme will automatically terminate upon the effective date of the termination of the MMS Agreement and may not be terminated independently from the MMS Agreement.\nIf we were obligated or given the option to buy out Genzyme\u2019s interest in Aldurazyme and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, and thereby gain exclusive rights to Aldurazyme, we may not have sufficient funds to do so and we may not be able to obtain the financing to do so. If we fail to buy out Genzyme\u2019s interest, we may be held in breach of the agreement and may lose any claim to the rights to Aldurazyme and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals. We would then effectively be prohibited from developing and commercializing Aldurazyme. If this happened, not only would our product revenues decrease, but our share price would also decline.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe conduct a significant amount of our sales and operations outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the sales of Aldurazyme, Brineura, Kuvan, Naglazyme and Vimizim are generated from countries other than the U.S. Similarly, we expect a significant portion of the sales of Palynziq to be generated from countries other than the U.S. We have operations in Canada and in several European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and Latin American countries. We expect that\nwe will continue to expand our international operations in the future. International operations inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022the increased complexity and costs inherent in managing international operations;\n\u2022diverse regulatory and compliance requirements, and changes in those requirements that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products;\n\u2022political and economic instability;\n\u2022diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022differing labor regulations and business practices;\n\u2022potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u2022changes in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u2022financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and potential currency controls imposed by non-U.S. governments;\n\u2022regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 and service providers\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA); and\n\u2022rapidly evolving global laws and regulations relating to data protection and the privacy and security of commercial and personal information.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs we continue to expand our existing international operations, we may encounter new risks. For example, as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions, we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies. If we are not successful in developing and maintaining these relationships, we may not be able to grow sales in these geographic regions. These or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nA significant portion of our international sales are made based on special access programs, and changes to these programs could adversely affect our product sales and revenue in these countries.\nWe make a significant portion of our international sales of Naglazyme and Vimizim through special access or \u201cnamed patient\u201d programs, which do not require full product approval, and we expect a significant portion of our international sales of Brineura will also be through such programs. The specifics of the programs vary from country to country. Generally, special approval must be obtained for each patient. The approval normally requires an application or a lawsuit accompanied by evidence of medical need. Generally, the approvals for each patient must be renewed from time to time.\nThese programs are not well defined in some countries and are subject to changes in requirements and funding levels. Any change to these programs could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in those countries and delay sales. If the programs are not funded by the respective government, there could be insufficient funds to pay for all patients. Further, governments have and may continue to undertake unofficial measures to limit purchases of our products, including initially denying coverage for purchasers, delaying orders and denying or taking excessively long to approve customs clearance. Any such actions could materially delay or reduce our revenues from such countries.\nWithout the special access programs, we would need to seek full product approval to commercially market and sell our products in certain jurisdictions. This can be an expensive and time-consuming process and may subject our products to additional price controls. Because the number of patients is so small in some countries, it may not be economically feasible to seek and maintain a full product approval, and therefore the sales in such country would be permanently reduced or eliminated. For all of these reasons, if the special access programs that we are currently using are eliminated or restricted, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nU.S. export control and economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, compliance with such regulatory requirements may increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to sell our products and collect cash from customers.\nOur products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Exports of our products and solutions must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. Changes to these laws and regulations, or to the countries, governments, persons or activities targeted by such laws, could result in decreased use of our products, or hinder our ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers, which would likely adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges and fines.\nWe rely on a general license from OFAC to sell our medicines for eventual use by hospital and clinic end-users in Iran. The use of this OFAC general license requires us to observe strict conditions with respect to products sold, end-user limitations and payment requirements. Although we believe we have maintained compliance with the general license requirements, there can be no assurance that the general license will not be revoked, be renewed in the future or that we will remain in compliance. A violation of the OFAC general license could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives.\nMoreover, U.S. export control and economic sanctions may make operating in certain countries more difficult and expensive. For example, we may be unable to find distributors or financial institutions willing to facilitate the sale of our products and collection of cash from such sales in a cost-effective manner, if at all.\nFailure to comply with applicable anti-corruption legislation could result in fines, criminal penalties and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the FCPA in the U.S., the United Kingdom (U.K.) Bribery Act and other similar laws in other countries in which we do business. We operate in a number of countries that are recognized to have a reputation for corruption and pose an increased risk of corrupt practices. We also regularly interact with government regulators in many countries, including those that are considered higher risk for corruption, in order to secure regulatory approval to manufacture and distribute our products. The anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws to which we are subject generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials or other persons for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business and/or other benefits. These laws also require us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered non-U.S. officials for purposes of applicable anti-corruption laws.\nAlthough we have adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and third-party agents will comply with such laws, there can be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively at all times or protect us against liability under these or other laws for actions taken by our employees, partners and other third parties with respect to our business. If we are not in compliance with anti-corruption laws and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities and/or officials (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Investigations of any actual or alleged violations of such laws or policies related to us could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nMoreover, there has been enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. There has also been enhanced scrutiny by governments on reimbursement support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. If we, our third-party agents or donation recipients are deemed to have failed to comply with laws, regulations or government guidance in any of these areas, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. Any similar violations by our competitors could also negatively impact our industry reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our products.\nOur international operations pose currency risks, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income.\nA significant and growing portion of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Great British Pound, the Canadian Dollar and several other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar (USD) will impact our revenues and expenses. If the USD were to weaken against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would increase,\nhaving a negative impact on earnings. Conversely, if the USD were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in USD, changes in currency exchange rates between the USD and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. Therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.\nWe implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates. However, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. These risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe face credit risks from government-owned or sponsored customers outside of the U.S. that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur product sales to government-owned or supported customers in various countries outside of the U.S. are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or preserve our market shares.\nWhere appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our technology. Patent protection may not be available for some of the products we are developing. If we must spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business and financial prospects may be harmed.\nThe patent positions of biopharmaceutical products are complex and uncertain. The scope and extent of patent protection for some of our products and product candidates are particularly uncertain because key information on some of our product candidates has existed in the public domain for many years. The composition and genetic sequences of animal and/or human versions of Aldurazyme, Naglazyme and many of our product candidates have been published and are believed to be in the public domain. The chemical structure of 6R-BH4 (the active ingredient in Kuvan) has also been published. Publication of this information may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to our products and product candidates, including without limitation composition-of-matter patents, which are generally believed to offer the strongest patent protection.\nWe own or have licensed patents and patent applications related to our products. However, these patents and patent applications do not ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including without limitation the following:\n\u2022With respect to pending patent applications, unless and until actually issued, the protective value of these applications is impossible to determine. We do not know whether our patent applications will result in issued patents.\n\u2022Patents have limited duration and expire.\n\u2022Enforcing patents is expensive and may absorb significant time of our management. Management would spend less time and resources on developing products, which could increase our operating expenses and delay product programs.\n\u2022Receipt of a patent may not provide much, if any, practical protection. For example, if we receive a patent with a narrow scope, then it will be easier for competitors to design products that do not infringe on our patent.\n\u2022The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011, which reformed certain patent laws in the U.S., may create additional uncertainty. Among the significant changes are switching from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, and the implementation of new procedures that permit competitors to challenge our patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office after grant.\nIt is also unclear whether our trade secrets are adequately protected. Our current and former employees, consultants or contractors may unintentionally or willfully disclose trade secrets to competitors. Enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, as with patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, requires significant resources and has an unpredictable outcome. In addition, courts outside of the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, in which case we would not be able to enforce our trade secret rights against such competitors.\nUnder policies recently adopted in the EU, clinical trial data submitted to the EMA in MAAs that were traditionally regarded as confidential commercial information are now subject to public disclosure. Subject to our ability to review and redact a narrow sub-set of confidential commercial information, the new EU policies will result in the EMA\u2019s public disclosure of certain of our clinical study reports, clinical trial data summaries and clinical overviews for recently completed and future MAA submissions. The move toward public disclosure of development data could adversely affect our business in many ways, including, for example, resulting in the disclosure of our confidential methodologies for development of our products, preventing us from obtaining intellectual property right protection for innovations, requiring us to allocate significant resources to prevent other companies from violating our intellectual property rights, adding even more complexity to processing health data from clinical trials consistent with applicable data privacy regulations, and enabling competitors to use our data to gain approvals for their own products.\nCompetitors may interfere with our patent process in a variety of ways. Competitors may claim that they invented the claimed invention prior to us or that they filed their application for a patent on a claimed invention before we did. Competitors may also claim that we are infringing on their patents and therefore we cannot practice our technology. Competitors may also contest our patents by showing the patent examiner or a court that the invention was not original, was not novel or was obvious, for example. In litigation, a competitor could claim that our issued patents are not valid or are unenforceable for a number of reasons. If a court agrees, we would not be able to enforce that patent. Moreover, generic manufacturers may use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of our products notwithstanding our filed patents or patent applications.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, third parties could develop competing products, which could adversely affect our revenue and financial results generally.\nCompetitors and other third parties may have developed intellectual property that could limit our ability to market and commercialize our products and product candidates, if approved.\nSimilar to us, competitors continually seek intellectual property protection for their technology. Several of our development programs, such as valoctocogene roxaparvovec, focus on therapeutic areas that have been the subject of extensive research and development by third parties for many years. Due to the amount of intellectual property in our field of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors granted or created in the future. For example, if a patent holder believes our product infringes its patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology. If someone else claims we infringe its intellectual property, we would face a number of issues, including the following:\n\u2022Defending a lawsuit takes significant executive resources and can be very expensive.\n\u2022If a court decides that our product infringes a competitor\u2019s intellectual property, we may have to pay substantial damages.\n\u2022With respect to patents, in addition to requiring us to pay substantial damages, a court may prohibit us from making, selling, offering to sell, importing or using our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us. The patent holder is not required to grant us a license. If a license is available, it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. For example, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents and patent applications.\n\u2022We may need to redesign our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\n\u2022Redesigning our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of competitors may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.\nWe may also support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational institutions. These research partners may be unwilling to grant us any exclusive rights to technology or products derived from these collaborations.\nIf we do not obtain required licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or may be prohibited from making, using, importing, offering to sell or selling products requiring these licenses or rights. There is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or products developed\nin collaboration with other parties. If we are not able to resolve such disputes and obtain the licenses or rights we need, we may not be able to develop or market our products.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nOur stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nOur valuation and stock price may have no meaningful relationship to current or historical earnings, asset values, book value or many other criteria based on conventional measures of stock value. The market price of our common stock will fluctuate due to factors including:\n\u2022product sales and profitability of our products;\n\u2022manufacturing, supply or distribution of our product candidates and commercial products;\n\u2022progress of our product candidates through the regulatory process and our ability to successfully commercialize any such products that receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022results of clinical trials, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022generic competition to Kuvan tablets and powder relating to our settlements with the two pharmaceutical companies described above in this Risk Factors section or potential generic competition from future competitors;\n\u2022government regulatory action affecting our product candidates, our products or our competitors\u2019 product candidates and products in both the U.S. and non-U.S. countries;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights;\n\u2022general market conditions and fluctuations for the emerging growth and pharmaceutical market sectors;\n\u2022economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad;\n\u2022negative publicity about us or the pharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022cybersecurity incidents experienced by us or others in our industry;\n\u2022broad market fluctuations in the U.S., the EU or in other parts of the world;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, including due to timing of large orders for our products, in particular in Latin America, where governments place large periodic orders for Naglazyme and Vimizim;\n\u2022changes in company assessments or financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022acquisitions of products, businesses, or other assets; and\n\u2022sales of our shares of stock by us, our significant stockholders, or members of our management or Board of Directors.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In some cases, these fluctuations have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, in September 2020, after a substantial drop in our stock price that followed an announcement providing a regulatory update regarding valoctocogene roxaparvovec, we and certain of our officers were sued in a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements. We may be the target of additional litigation of this type in the future as well. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nIn addition, our stock price can be materially adversely affected by factors beyond our control, such as disruptions in global financial markets or negative trends in the biotechnology sector of the economy, even if our business is operating well.\nConversion of the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Certain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of us more difficult, even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders. Our anti-takeover provisions include provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws providing that stockholders\u2019 meetings may only be called by our Chairman, the lead independent director or the majority of our Board of Directors and that the stockholders may not take action by written consent and requiring that stockholders that desire to nominate any person for election to our Board of Directors or to make any proposal with respect to business to be conducted at a meeting of our stockholders be submitted in appropriate form to our Secretary within a specified period of time in advance of any such meeting. Additionally, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders. The rights of holders of our common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of 15% or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, our Board of Directors approves the transaction. Our Board of Directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of us. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our Board of Directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take us over.\nThe terms of the Notes require us to repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change. A takeover of us would trigger options by the respective holders of the applicable Notes to require us to repurchase such Notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders or investors in the Notes.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the U.S. as the exclusive forums for the adjudication of certain disputes, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\u2022any derivative claim or cause of action brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any claim or cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of BioMarin to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022any claim or cause of action against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022any claim or cause of action as to which the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\n\u2022any claim or cause of action against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive-forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the U.S. of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated bylaws. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business. Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that any person or entity that acquires any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of such provisions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur future growth and success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract, retain, manage and motivate our employees. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nBecause of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. In particular, the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us if we do not have an adequate succession plan or if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. While our senior executive officers are parties to employment agreements with us, these agreements do not guarantee that they will remain employed with us in the future. In addition, in many cases, these agreements do not restrict our senior executive officers\u2019 ability to compete with us after their employment is terminated. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. Due to this intense competition, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to manage our growth.\nProduct candidates that we are currently developing or may license or acquire in the future may be intended for patient populations that are significantly larger than any of the patient populations we currently target. In order to continue development and marketing of these products, if approved, we will need to significantly expand our operations. To manage expansion effectively, we need to continue to develop and improve our research and development capabilities, manufacturing and quality capacities, sales and marketing capabilities, financial and administrative systems and standard processes for global operations. Our staff, financial resources, systems, procedures or controls may be inadequate to support our operations and may increase our exposure to regulatory and corruption risks and our management may be unable to manage successfully future market opportunities or our relationships with customers and other third parties.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nNew tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, and existing tax laws or regulations could be interpreted, modified or applied in a manner that is adverse to us or our customers, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws, including changes in corporate tax rates, the application of certain tax credits (including a reduction of tax credits under the Orphan Drug Act), the deductibility of expenses, the utilization of net operating losses (NOLs) and other deferred tax assets, and the taxation of non-U.S. earnings. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the TCJA may affect us, and certain aspects of the TCJA could be repealed or modified in future legislation. For example, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, modified certain provisions of the TCJA, including provisions relating to NOL utilization. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA, the CARES Act, or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. The impact of changes under the TCJA, the CARES Act, or future reform legislation could increase our future U.S. tax expense and could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nMoreover, changes in the tax laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), or other initiatives led by the European Commission. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries including the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations, made several recommendations with the aim of addressing tax avoidance and ensuring that profits are taxed where economic activities generating the profits are performed and where value is created. These\nchanges, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm's length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. If tax authorities successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arm's length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, resulting in a higher tax liability. In addition, if a country from which income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both that country and the other country to which the income was allocated could tax the same income, potentially resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are found in violation of healthcare laws or privacy and data protection laws, we may be required to pay penalties, be subjected to scrutiny by regulators or governmental entities, or be suspended from participation in government healthcare programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and laws related to ensuring compliance. In the U.S., the federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a pharmaceutical company, to knowingly and willfully offer, solicit, pay or receive any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and related regulations, certain arrangements are deemed not to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute if they fit within a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. However, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration not intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from Anti-Kickback liability, although we seek to comply with these safe harbors. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers.\nFederal and state false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), we also are prohibited from, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nIn addition, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws in the U.S. For example, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. Moreover, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, integrity, availability, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Many state and non-U.S. laws also govern the privacy and security of health information. They often differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In the United States, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sales, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA will be expanded substantially on January 1, 2023 when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA), becomes fully operative. The CPRA will, among other things, give consumers the ability to limit use of information deemed to be sensitive, increase the maximum penalties for violations concerning consumers under age 16, expand an individual\u2019s private right of action and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law and impose administrative fines. Aspects of the CCPA and CPRA and their interpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\nThe European Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as EU Member State implementing legislations, apply to the processing of personal data of individuals located in the EEA, including health-related\ninformation, by companies located in the EEA, or in certain circumstances, by companies located outside of the EEA. These laws impose strict obligations on the ability to collect, record, store, disclose, use and transmit personal data, including health-related information. These include several requirements relating to (i) obtaining, in some situations, the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, (ii) the information provided to the individuals about how their personal information is used, (iii) ensuring the security and confidentiality of the personal data, (iv) the obligation to notify regulatory authorities and affected individuals of personal data breaches, (v) extensive internal privacy governance obligations, and (vi) obligations to honor rights of individuals in relation to their personal data (for example, the right to access, correct and delete their data). The GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA, such as the United States, which are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection. Switzerland has adopted similar restrictions. Potential pecuniary fines for noncompliant companies may be up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual global revenue. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and has increased our compliance costs.\nThe GDPR and other European data protection laws generally restrict the transfer of personal information from Europe, including the EEA and Switzerland, to the U.S. and most other countries unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal information. One of the primary safeguards allowing U.S. companies to import personal information from Europe has been the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). However, the Court of Justice of the EU issued a decision that called into question whether the SCCs can lawfully be used for transfers of personal information from Europe to the United States or most other countries. At present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the SCCs, on which we have relied for personal information transfers from Europe to the United States and other \u201cthird countries.\u201d The Court of Justice of the EU ruled that subject to their containing \u201ceffective mechanisms\u201d to ensure compliance with the protections offered by EU law, namely implementation of transfer impact assessments regarding country surveillance laws, the SCCs were generally upheld. New SCCs will be published in the coming months and will require implementation within 12 months from publication. Compliance with the regulations covering the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S. has increased our compliance costs.\nFollowing the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020 and the end of the transitional arrangements agreed to between the U.K. and EU, the GDPR no longer has effect in law in the U.K. However, the data protection obligations of the GDPR continue to apply to U.K.-related processing of personal data in substantially unvaried form under the so-called \u201cUK GDPR\u201d (i.e., the GDPR as it continues to form part of law in the U.K. However, going forward, there will be increasing scope for divergence in application, interpretation and enforcement of the data protection law as between the U.K. and EEA. Furthermore, the relationship between the U.K. and the EEA in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, which could expose us to two parallel regimes, each of which potentially authorizes similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations. Also in the event of a violation of the GDPR affecting data subjects across the U.K. and the EEA, we could potentially be investigated by, and ultimately fined by the U.K. Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and the supervisory authority in each and every EEA Member State where data subjects have been affected by such violation.\nSubstantial new laws and regulations affecting compliance have also been adopted in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. countries, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. For example, in the U.S., the PPACA, through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, requires certain drug, biologicals and medical supply manufacturers to collect and report to CMS information on payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as investment and ownership interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Effective January 1, 2022, manufacturers will also be required to report on payments or transfers of value, and ownership and investment interests held, during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased state regulation of payments made to physicians. Certain states and/or local jurisdictions mandate implementation of compliance programs, compliance with the Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians, marketing expenditures, and drug pricing. Likewise, in many non-U.S. countries there is an increasing focus on the relationship between drug companies and healthcare practitioners. Recently enacted non-U.S. legislation creates reporting obligations on payments, gifts and benefits made to these professionals; however, implementing regulations enacting such laws are still pending and subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies. The shifting regulatory environment and the need to implement systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the costs of maintaining compliance and the possibility that we may violate one or more of the requirements and be subject to fines or sanctions.\nDue to the breadth of the healthcare and privacy and data protection laws described above, the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions and safe harbors and the increased focus by law enforcement agencies in enforcing such laws, our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-\ncompliance with these laws, curtailment of our operations, and debarment, suspension or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.\nWe are exposed to the potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. We currently maintain insurance against product liability lawsuits for the commercial sale of our products and for the clinical trials of our product candidates. Pharmaceutical companies must balance the cost of insurance with the level of coverage based on estimates of potential liability. Historically, the potential liability associated with product liability lawsuits for pharmaceutical products has been unpredictable. Although we believe that our current insurance is a reasonable estimate of our potential liability and represents a commercially reasonable balancing of the level of coverage as compared to the cost of the insurance, we may be subject to claims in connection with our clinical trials and commercial use of our products and product candidates for which our insurance coverage may not be adequate and we may be unable to avoid significant liability if any product liability lawsuit is brought against us. If we are the subject of a successful product liability claim that exceeds the limits of any insurance coverage we obtain, we may incur substantial charges that would adversely affect our earnings and require the commitment of capital resources that might otherwise be available for the development and commercialization of our product programs.\nWe rely significantly on information technology systems and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively and have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on our information technology systems to effectively manage and maintain our operations, inventory and internal reports, to manufacture and ship products to customers and to timely invoice them. Any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that infrastructure or security lapse of that technology, including cybersecurity incidents or attacks, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. Our ability to manage and maintain our operations, inventory and internal reports, to manufacture and ship our products to customers and timely invoice them depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, production management and other information systems. Our technology systems, including our cloud technologies, continue to increase in multitude and complexity, making them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, cyberattack and other disruptions. Potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded technology systems or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and expose us to greater risk of security breaches. Cybersecurity incidents, including phishing attacks and attempts to misappropriate or compromise confidential or proprietary information or sabotage enterprise IT systems are becoming increasingly frequent and more sophisticated. Cybersecurity incidents resulting in the failure of our enterprise resource planning system, production management or other systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security or other unauthorized access or unavailability of these systems, have occurred in the past and may affect our ability in the future to manage and maintain our operations, inventory and internal reports, and result in delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations.\nAs part of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, proprietary data, intellectual property and personal data. The information and data processed and stored in our technology systems, and those of our research collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, or other third parties for which we depend to operate our business, may be vulnerable to loss, damage, denial-of-service, unauthorized access or misappropriation. Data security breaches may be the result of unauthorized or unintended activity (or lack of activity) by our employees or contractors or malware, hacking, business email compromise, phishing or other cyberattacks directed by third parties. These third parties for which we depend on to operate our business have experienced and may continue to experience cybersecurity incidents. While we have implemented measures to protect our information and data stored in our technology systems and those of the third parties that we rely on, our efforts may not be successful.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience cybersecurity incidents. Although to our knowledge we have not experienced any material incident or interruption to date, if such an event were to occur it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and commercial operations, including due to a loss, corruption or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets, personal data or other proprietary or sensitive information. Further, these cybersecurity incidents can lead to the public disclosure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients and others and result in demands for ransom or other forms of blackmail. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including industrial espionage) and expertise, including by organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists\u201d, nation states and others. Moreover, the costs to us to investigate and mitigate cybersecurity incidents could be significant. For example, the loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our product development or regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Any security breach that results in the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal data may require us to notify individuals, governmental authorities, credit reporting agencies, or other parties pursuant to privacy and security laws and regulations or other obligations. Such a security compromise could harm our reputation, erode confidence in our information security measures, and lead to regulatory scrutiny. To the extent that any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of, or damage to, our data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or personal information, we could be exposed to a risk of loss, enforcement measures,\npenalties, fines, indemnification claims, litigation and potential civil or criminal liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a natural disaster, terrorist or criminal activity or other unforeseen event caused significant damage to our facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers or significantly disrupted our operations or those of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue, have reduced margins, or be forced to terminate a program.\nThe occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facility and equipment, or that of our third-party manufacturers or single-source suppliers, which could materially impair the ability for us or our third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products and product candidates. Our Galli Drive facility, located in Novato, California, is currently our only manufacturing facility for Aldurazyme, Naglazyme and Palynziq and is one of two manufacturing facilities for Brineura and Vimizim. Our gene therapy manufacturing facility is also located in Novato, California, and it is currently our only manufacturing facility to support valoctocogene roxaparvovec clinical development activities and the anticipated commercial demand for valoctocogene roxaparvovec, if approved. These facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We, the third-party manufacturers with whom we contract and our single-source suppliers of raw materials, which include many of our critical raw materials, are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fires, explosions, floods, and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, or any terrorist or criminal activity caused significant damage to our facilities or the facilities of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers, our ability to manufacture our products, or to have our products manufactured, could be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired, and our commercialization efforts and revenue could be seriously impaired.\nMoreover, other unforeseen events, such as power outages, could significantly disrupt our operations or those of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers, which could result in significant delays in the manufacture of our products and adversely impact our commercial operations and revenues. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the electric utility in the San Francisco Bay Area where many of our facilities are located, commenced widespread blackouts during the fall of 2019 to avoid and contain wildfires sparked during strong wind events by downed power lines or equipment failures. While we have not experienced damage to our facilities or material disruption to our operations as a result of these power outages, ongoing blackouts, particularly if prolonged or frequent, could impact our business going forward. The insurance that we carry, the inventory that we maintain and our risk mitigation plans may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions.\nOur business is affected by macroeconomic conditions.\nVarious macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets. For instance, if inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, it may not be feasible to pass price increases on to our customers due to the process by which healthcare providers are reimbursed for our products by the government. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate our investments in order to fund our operations. We purchase or enter into a variety of financial instruments and transactions, including investments in commercial paper, the extension of credit to corporations, institutions and governments and hedging contracts. If any of the issuers or counter parties to these instruments were to default on their obligations, it could materially reduce the value of the transaction and adversely affect our cash flows.\nWe sell our products in countries that face economic volatility and weakness. Although we have historically collected receivables from customers in those countries, sustained weakness or further deterioration of the local economies and currencies may cause customers in those countries to be unable to pay for our products. Additionally, if one or more of these countries were unable to purchase our products, our revenue would be adversely affected.\nInterest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of our customers/distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute our products. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers, sole-source or single-source suppliers to remain in business or otherwise manufacture or supply product. Failure by any of them to remain a going concern could affect our ability to manufacture products.", "PERMNO": 87056, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "BMRN"}
