{"cik": "34956", "company": "TENAX THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition and operating results may be affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from our past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the accompanying financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nOur independent registered public accounting firm auditors\u2019 report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of our historical operating losses and expected future negative cash flows from operations, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Similarly, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may materially and adversely affect the price per share of our common stock and make it more difficult to obtain financing. Our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception, expect to continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred losses since inception. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred net operating losses of $32.7 million and $9.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $278.5 million. We have funded our operations since September 1990 principally through the issuance of debt and equity securities and loans from stockholders. We will continue to incur losses until we generate sufficient revenue to offset our expenses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for at least the next several years. We expect to incur additional expenses related to our development and potential commercialization of levosimendan for pulmonary hypertension, imatinib for PAH, and other potential indications, as well as identifying and developing other potential product candidates, and as a result, we will need to generate significant net product sales, royalty and other revenues to achieve profitability.\nWe will require substantial additional funding for further development of our product candidates. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development efforts and other operations.\nDeveloping biopharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and establishing manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities, is expensive. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA, require that we perform additional studies to those that we currently anticipate, in which case the timing of any potential product approval may be delayed.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $5.6 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We will need substantial additional capital in the future in order to complete the regulatory approval and commercialization of levosimendan and imatinib and to fund the development and commercialization of future product candidates. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. Such funding, if needed, may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. In the event we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may delay or reduce the scope of our current research and development programs and other expenses.\nIf adequate funds are not available, we may also be required to eliminate one or more of our clinical trials, delaying approval of levosimendan and imatinib or our commercialization efforts. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience additional significant dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. We may also consider strategic alternatives, including a sale of our company, merger, other business combination or recapitalization.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nthe number of investigator sites and patients who participate, the rate of enrollment and the potential impact the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the expected timelines for each of our clinical programs;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and timing of regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of completion of clinical and commercial-scale manufacturing activities; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following factors, among others:\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain additional funding to develop our product candidates, and any further product candidate which we may develop or in-license in the future;\n\u00b7\ndelays in the commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical testing, as well as the analysis and reporting of results from such clinical testing;\n\u00b7\nthe need to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\npotential risks related to any collaborations we may enter into for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe success of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nany delays in regulatory review and approval of product candidates in development;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish an effective sales and marketing infrastructure;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our products;\n\u00b7\npotential side effects of our product candidates that could delay or prevent commercialization;\n\u00b7\npotential product liability claims and adverse events;\n\u00b7\npotential liabilities associated with hazardous materials;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain adequate insurance policies;\n\u00b7\nour dependency on third-party manufacturers and clinical research organizations, or CROs;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish or maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements;\n\u00b7\nour ability, our partners\u2019 abilities, and third parties\u2019 abilities to protect and assert intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\ncosts related to and outcomes of potential litigation;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with obligations under intellectual property licenses with third parties;\n\u00b7\nour ability to adequately support future growth;\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract and retain key personnel, including advisors and members of our Board of Directors; and\n\u00b7\nvolatility and uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets in light of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical uncertainties, including tensions in Ukraine.\nDue to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy and Operations\nWe are limited in the number of products we can simultaneously pursue and therefore our survival depends on our success with a small number of product opportunities.\nWe have limited financial resources, so at present we are primarily focusing these resources on developing levosimendan for the treatment of PH-HFpEF and imatinib for the treatment of PAH, in addition to exploring strategic alternatives in order to maximize stockholder value. At present, we intend to commit most of our resources to advancing our existing product candidates to the point they receive regulatory approval for the treatment of various pulmonary hypertension indications. If as a consequence of the results of our planned Phase 3 trials, or the results of prior clinical trials performed using levosimendan or imatinib, we are unable to receive regulatory approval of one or both of our existing product candidates, then we may not have resources to pursue development of any other products and our business could terminate.\nA pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, or another coronavirus or similar disrupting illness, may materially and adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nThe spread of COVID-19, including variant strains, has affected segments of the global economy and may affect our operations, including the potential interruption of our clinical trial activities and our supply chain. The continued spread of COVID-19 may result in a period of continued or recurring business disruption in these and other areas impacting our business, including the establishment of contractual relationships with investigators enrolling subjects in our clinical trials, the continuity of care provided by these institutions to the patients we seek to enroll and their ability to support industry-funded research as a means of caring for their patients, supply of these sites with study materials, and the enrolment of subjects and their adherence with study requirements. In addition, there could be a potential effect of COVID-19 to the business at FDA or other health authorities, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals, including with respect to our product candidates.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 globally could adversely affect our clinical trial operations in the United States and elsewhere, including our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 if an outbreak occurs in their geography. Further, some patients may be unable to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines or travel restrictions impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services, or if the patients become infected with COVID-19 themselves, which would delay our ability to initiate and/or complete planned clinical and preclinical studies in the future. COVID-19 may also affect employees of third-party CRO, located in affected geographies that we rely upon to carry out our clinical trials, which could result in inefficiencies due to reductions in staff and disruptions to work environments.\nThe spread of COVID-19, or another infectious disease, could also negatively affect the operations at our third-party manufacturers, which could result in delays or disruptions in the supply of our product candidates. In addition, we have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including reducing non-essential travel worldwide for our employees and discouraging employee attendance at healthcare and investment industry events, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, however, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operation and financial condition.\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have historically operated with a limited number of employees. As of the date of this report, we have eight full-time employees and one part-time employee. Therefore, institutional knowledge is concentrated within a small number of employees. Our success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel to continue the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. We will need to hire or contract with additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. Additionally, our future success is highly dependent upon the contributions of our senior management team. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials or the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face intense competition from other companies and organizations for qualified personnel. Other companies and organizations with which we compete for personnel may have greater financial and other resources and different risk profiles than we do, and a history of successful development and commercialization of their product candidates. Replacing key employees and attracting sufficiently skilled new employees may be difficult and costly, and we may not have other personnel with the capacity to assume all the responsibilities of a key employee upon his or her departure or to take on the duties necessary to continue growing our company and pursuing our business strategy. If we cannot attract and retain skilled personnel, as needed, we may not achieve our development and other goals.\nIn addition, the success of our business will depend on our ability to develop and maintain relationships with respected service providers and industry-leading consultants and advisors. If we cannot develop and maintain such relationships, as needed, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates may be limited. In addition, our outsourcing strategy, which has included engaging consultants to manage core administrative and operational functions, may subject us to scrutiny under labor laws and regulations, which may divert management time and attention and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Drug Development and Commercialization\nWe currently have no approved drug products for sale, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable drug products.\nWe currently have no approved drug products for sale. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing, and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, from the FDA for each product candidate. We have not submitted an NDA or received marketing approval for any of our product candidates, and obtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, markets outside of the United States also have requirements for approval of drug candidates which we must comply with prior to marketing. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable drug products.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Additionally, the FDA may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program.\nWe are required to conduct additional clinical trials in the future, which are expensive and time consuming, and the outcome of the trials is uncertain.\nWe expect to commit a substantial portion of our financial and business resources over the next four years to clinical testing of our product candidates and advancing these products to regulatory approval for use in one or more medical applications. All of these clinical trials and testing will be expensive and time consuming and the timing of the regulatory review process is uncertain. The applicable regulatory agencies may suspend clinical trials at any time if they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete our clinical trials successfully or obtain FDA or other governmental or regulatory approval of our product candidates, or that such approval, if obtained, will not include limitations on the indicated uses for which our product candidates may be marketed. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are critically dependent on obtaining capital to advance our testing program and receiving FDA and other governmental and regulatory approvals of our products. A significant delay in or failure of our planned clinical trials or a failure to achieve these approvals would have a material adverse effect on us and could result in major business and financial setbacks.\nThe market may not accept our products.\nIf any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy, safety and potential advantages of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u00b7\nthe convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments, if any;\n\u00b7\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling, including any black box warning;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new treatments and of physicians to prescribe these treatments;\n\u00b7\nour ability to hire and retain a sales force in the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe strength of manufacturing, marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement for of levosimendan, imatinib and any other product candidates, once approved;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects; and\n\u00b7\nany restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.\nInterim \u201ctop-line\u201d and preliminary results from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available, and these results are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publish interim top-line or preliminary results from our clinical trials. Interim results from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment and treatment extends, and more patient experience is observed. Preliminary or top-line results also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects and may cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nAny collaboration we enter with third parties to develop and commercialize any future product candidates may place the development of our product candidates outside our control, may require us to relinquish important rights or may otherwise be on terms unfavorable to us.\nWe may enter into collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize future product candidates. Our dependence on future partners for development and commercialization of our product candidates would subject us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our partners may devote to the development or commercialization of our product candidates or to their marketing and distribution;\n\u00b7\npartners may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7\ndisputes may arise between us and our partners that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u00b7\npartners may experience financial difficulties;\n\u00b7\npartners may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights, or may use our proprietary information, in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a partner\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a partner\u2019s willingness or ability to meet its obligations under any arrangement;\n\u00b7\na partner could independently move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors; and\n\u00b7\nthe collaborations with our partners may be terminated or allowed to expire, which would delay the development and may increase the cost of developing our product candidates.\nDelays in the enrollment and completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nDelays in the enrollment and completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our ability to gain FDA approval of current product candidates and could significantly increase our future product development costs. The completion of clinical trials requires us to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs for the same indication as our product candidates or may be required to withdraw from our clinical trial as a result of changing standards of care or may become ineligible to participate in clinical studies. The enrollment and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of other reasons, including delays related to:\n\u00b7\nthe evolving COVID-19 pandemic, which might cause site closures because of infected staff or cause patients to avoid or be unable to travel to healthcare facilities and physicians\u2019 offices unless due to a health emergency;\n\u00b7\nreaching agreements on acceptable terms with prospective trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among trial sites;\n\u00b7\nobtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical trial at numerous prospective sites;\n\u00b7\nrecruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including meeting the enrollment criteria for our study and competition from other clinical trial programs for the same indication as our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining and supplying clinical trial material on a timely basis; and\n\u00b7\ncollecting, analyzing and reporting final data from the clinical trials.\nIn addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nfailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u00b7\ninspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen safety issues or any determination that a trial presents unacceptable health risks; and\n\u00b7\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies, and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes with appropriate regulatory authorities. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we terminate, our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Even if we are able to ultimately commercialize our product candidates, other therapies for the same or similar indications may have been introduced to the market and established a competitive advantage.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nIntense competition might render our cardiovascular and pulmonary product candidates noncompetitive or obsolete.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical industry in general and in our therapeutic sectors in particular is intense and characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. Technological developments by competitors, regulatory approval for marketing competitive products, including potential generic or over-the-counter products, or superior marketing resources possessed by competitors could adversely affect the commercial potential of our cardiovascular and pulmonary disease product candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and results of operations. We believe that there are numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research groups throughout the world, engaged in research and development efforts with respect to pharmaceutical products targeted at cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and conditions addressed by our product pipeline. Developments by others might render our product pipeline obsolete or noncompetitive. Competitors might be able to complete the development and regulatory approval process sooner and, therefore, market their cardiovascular and pulmonary disease products earlier than we can.\nMany of our current competitors have significant financial, marketing and personnel resources and development capabilities. For example, many large, well-capitalized companies already offer cardiovascular and pulmonary products and services in the United States and Europe that target the indications for which our product candidates are being developed. Currently, as an example, twelve vasodilators are marketed in the U.S. for use in patients with PAH, and sales teams from Janssen, Pfizer, Bayer, United Therapeutics, and other large companies with marketing and sales capabilities represent these products in the specialized care centers where the disease is treated.\nOur activities are and will continue to be subject to extensive government regulation, which is expensive and time consuming, and we will not be able to sell our products without regulatory approval.\nOur development, marketing and distribution of levosimendan and imatinib are, and will continue to be, subject to extensive regulation, monitoring and approval by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. There are significant risks at each stage of the regulatory scheme.\nProduct approval stage\nDuring the product approval stage, we attempt to prove the safety and efficacy of our product candidate for its indicated uses. There are numerous problems that could arise during this stage, including:\n\u00b7\nthe data obtained from laboratory testing and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent FDA and other regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nadverse events could cause the FDA and other regulatory authorities to halt trials;\n\u00b7\nat any time, the FDA and other regulatory agencies could change policies and regulations that could result in delay and perhaps rejection of our products;\n\u00b7\nif a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions; and\n\u00b7\neven after extensive testing and clinical trials, and receiving agreements and reassurances from FDA, EMA, and others, as to their future position on a dataset or result to be generated from a trial the design of which they have weighed in on, there is no assurance that regulatory approval will ever be obtained for any of our products.\nPost-commercialization stage\nDiscovery of previously unknown problems with our products, or unanticipated problems with our manufacturing arrangements, even after FDA and other regulatory approvals of our products for commercial sale may result in the imposition of significant restrictions, including withdrawal of the product from the market.\nAdditional laws and regulations may also be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products, including laws or regulations relating to the price or cost-effectiveness of medical products. Any delay or failure to achieve regulatory approval of commercial sales of our products is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies continue to review products even after they receive agency approval. If and when the FDA or another regulatory agency outside the United States approves one of our products, its manufacture and marketing will be subject to ongoing regulation, which could include compliance with current good manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting requirements and general prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses. We are also subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA for compliance with these and other requirements. Any enforcement action resulting from failure, even by inadvertence, to comply with these requirements could affect the manufacture and marketing of levosimendan, imatinib or our other products. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information. The FDA or another regulatory agency could also require us to conduct additional, and potentially expensive, studies in areas outside our approved indicated uses.\nWe may not receive all of the anticipated market exclusivity benefits of imatinib\u2019s orphan drug designation.\nTNX-201, Tenax\u2019s proprietary formulation of imatinib mesylate, a kinase inhibitor, received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA in the second quarter of 2020. Orphan Drug Designation may provide market exclusivity in the United States for seven years if (i) imatinib receives market approval before a competitor using a similar mechanism for the same indication, (ii) we are able to produce sufficient supply to meet demand in the marketplace, and (iii) another product with the same active ingredient is not subsequently deemed clinically superior.\nObtaining an Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA may not effectively protect our product candidates from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition, and orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving the same or a different drug in another indication. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a later application for the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer in a substantial portion of the target populations, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Moreover, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nAfter our products are commercialized, we expect to spend considerable time and money complying with federal and state laws and regulations governing their sale, and, if we are unable to fully comply with such laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties.\nHealth care providers, physicians and others will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our clinical products. Our arrangements with third-party payers and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we will market, sell and distribute our products. Applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations are expected to include, but not be limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nthe federal anti-kickback statute is a criminal statute that makes it a felony for individuals or entities knowingly and willfully to offer or pay, or to solicit or receive, direct or indirect remuneration, in order to induce the purchase, order, lease, or recommending of items or services, or the referral of patients for services, that are reimbursed under a federal health care program, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who knowingly submits, or causes another person or entity to submit, a false claim for payment of government funds, with penalties that include three times the government\u2019s damages plus civil penalties for each false claim; in addition, the False Claims Act permits a person with knowledge of fraud, referred to as a qui tam plaintiff, to file a lawsuit on behalf of the government against the person or business that committed the fraud, and, if the action is successful, the qui tam plaintiff is rewarded with a percentage of the recovery;\n\u00b7\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nthe Social Security Act contains numerous provisions allowing the imposition of a civil monetary penalty, a monetary assessment, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or some combination of these penalties; and\n\u00b7\nmany states have analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which, in some cases, impose more strict requirements than the federal laws and may require pharmaceutical companies to comply with certain price reporting and other compliance requirements.\nOur failure to comply with any of these federal and state health care laws and regulations, or health care laws in foreign jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to healthcare reform measures and reimbursement policies that, if not favorable to our products, could hinder or prevent our products\u2019 commercial success, if any of our product candidates are approved.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, such as Medicare, private health insurers and other organizations establish what we believe to be appropriate coverage and reimbursement for our approved products. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payer coverage and reimbursement could negatively affect the market acceptance of our product candidates and the future revenues we may expect to receive from any approved products. The commercial success of our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and other organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, we may not obtain coverage for our products after approval as a benefit under the third-party payers\u2019 plans or, even if we do, the level of coverage or payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status for newly approved drug products, including coding, coverage and payment. There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payers in the United States; therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. The coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate payment will be applied consistently or obtained. The process for determining whether a payer will cover and how much it will reimburse a product may be separate from the process of seeking approval of the product or for setting the price of the product. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use. Third-party payer reimbursement to providers of our products, if approved, may be subject to a bundled payment that also includes the procedure of administering our products or third-party payers may require providers to perform additional patient testing to justify the use of our products. To the extent there is no separate payment for our products, there may be further uncertainty as to the adequacy of reimbursement amounts.\nThe containment of healthcare costs is a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drug products have been a focus in this effort. The continuing efforts of government, private insurance companies and other organizations to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect our ability to set as high a price for our products as we might otherwise and the rate and scope of adoption of our products by healthcare providers. We expect that federal, state and local governments in the United States, as well as governments in other countries, will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient. It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or abroad, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions governmental or private payers for healthcare treatment and services may take in response to any such healthcare reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.\nThese potential courses of action are unpredictable and the potential impact of new legislation on our operations and financial position is uncertain, but may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement and additional downward pressure on the price we may receive for an approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products, if approved.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls and reimbursement approval policies, which may adversely affect our prospects for generating revenue outside the United States.\nWe have distribution rights in the United States and Canada for levosimendan and worldwide distribution rights to imatinib, and in some countries, particularly European Union countries and Canada, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. To obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries with respect to any product candidate that achieves regulatory approval, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products upon approval, if at all, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our prospects for generating revenue, if any, could be adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, if we achieve regulatory approval of any product, we must successfully negotiate product pricing for such product in individual countries. As a result, the pricing of our products, if approved, in different countries may vary widely, thus creating the potential for third-party trade in our products in an attempt to exploit price differences between countries. This third-party trade of our products could undermine our sales in markets with higher prices.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities, limit sales of our existing products and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of biotechnology products. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and an even greater risk when we commercially sell any products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our products and any product candidates that we may develop;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently maintain limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials in the total amount of $3 million. However, our profitability will be adversely affected by a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that product liability insurance will be available in the future or be available on reasonable terms.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or deficiencies in our cyber-security.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability, and damage to our reputation, and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include elements intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from security breaches. We also maintain compliance programs to address the potential applicability of restrictions against trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information generally and in connection with a cyber-security breach. However, a breakdown in existing controls and procedures around our cyber-security environment may prevent us from detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and value of our stock.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe currently rely significantly on third parties to conduct our nonclinical testing and clinical studies and other aspects of our development programs. If those third parties do not satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations or meet anticipated deadlines, the development of our product candidates could be adversely affected.\nWe do not currently employ personnel or possess the facilities necessary to conduct many of the activities associated with our development programs. We engage consultants, advisors, CROs and others to assist in the design and conduct of nonclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates, with interpretation of the results of those studies and with regulatory activities and expect to continue to outsource all or a significant amount of such activities. As a result, many important aspects of our development programs are and will continue to be outside our direct control and our third-party service providers may not perform their activities as required or expected, including the maintenance of Good Laboratory Practices (\u201cGLP\u201d) or Good Clinical Practices (\u201cGCP\u201d) compliance, which are ultimately our responsibility to ensure. Further, such third parties may not be as committed to the success of our programs as our own employees and, therefore, may not devote the same time, thoughtfulness, or creativity to completing projects or problem-solving as our own employees would. To the extent we are unable to successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe CROs we engage or may engage to execute our clinical studies play a significant role in the conduct of the studies, including the collection and analysis of study data, and we likely will depend on CROs and clinical investigators to conduct future clinical studies and to assist in analyzing data from completed studies and developing regulatory strategies for our product candidates. Individuals working at the CROs with which we contract, as well as investigators at the sites at which our studies are conducted, are not our employees, and we have limited control over the amount or timing of resources that they devote to their programs. If our CROs, study investigators, and/or third-party sponsors fail to devote sufficient time and resources to studies of our product candidates, if we and/or our CROs do not comply with all GLP and GCP regulatory and contractual requirements, or if their performance is substandard, it could adversely affect the development of our product candidates.\nIn addition, the third parties we engage may have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Through intentional or unintentional means, our competitors may benefit from lessons learned on the project that could ultimately harm our competitive position. Moreover, if a CRO fails to properly, or at all, perform our activities during a clinical study, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on acceptable terms or in a timely manner, or at all. Switching CROs may increase costs and divert management time and attention. In addition, there likely would be a transition period before a new CRO commences work. These challenges could result in delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical studies, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired and/or announced development timelines and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nWe depend on third parties to formulate and manufacture our products.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities for the clinical- or commercial-scale production of our products. To manufacture imatinib, we have contracted with various third-party suppliers and clinical manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, making us highly dependent on these CMOs. Currently, we do not have alternative CMOs to back up our primary vendors of clinical trial material or, if approved, commercial supply material. Identification of and discussions with other CMOs may be protracted and/or unsuccessful, or these new CMOs may be unsuccessful in producing the same results as the current primary CMOs producing the material. Therefore, if our primary CMOs become unable or unwilling to perform their required activities, we could experience protracted delays or interruptions in the supply of clinical trial material and, ultimately, product for commercial sale, which would materially and adversely affect our development programs, commercial activities, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the FDA or regulatory authorities outside of the United States may require us to have an alternate manufacturer of a drug product before approving any product candidate for marketing and sale in the United States or abroad. Securing such alternate manufacturer, if possible, could result in considerable additional time and cost prior to approval.\nPursuant to the terms of our license for levosimendan, Orion is at present our sole manufacturing source for TNX-103; should they opt not to provide us the product, our license agreement provides for 24 months\u2019 notice to Tenax of same, to allow an alternative manufacturer to be brought onboard. We might engage other third-party suppliers and CMOs for the supply and manufacture of TNX-102, or other formulations we might develop. Accordingly, our business is susceptible to disruption, and our results of operations can be adversely affected, by any disruption in supply or other adverse developments in our relationship with Orion. If supply from Orion is delayed or terminated, or if its facilities suffer any damage or disruption, we may need to successfully qualify an alternative supplier in a timely manner in order to avoid disruption of our business. If we cannot obtain an alternate manufacturer in a timely manner, we would experience a significant interruption in supply of levosimendan, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently have no marketing capabilities and no sales organization. If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities on our own or through third parties, we will be unable to successfully commercialize our products, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nTo commercialize our products, if approved, in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we may seek approvals, we must build our marketing, sales, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. We have not decided upon a commercialization strategy in these areas. We have no experience in the sale and marketing of approved medical products and marketing the licensing of such products before FDA or other regulatory approval. We do not know of any third party that is prepared to distribute our products should they be approved. If we decide to establish our own commercialization capability, we will need to recruit, train and retain a marketing staff and sales force with sufficient technical expertise. We do not know whether we can establish a commercialization program at a cost that is acceptable in relation to revenue or whether we can be successful in commercializing our product. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products directly and without strategic partners include:\n\u00b7\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u00b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.\nFurther, we may pursue arrangements regarding the sales and marketing and distribution of one or more of our product candidates and our future revenues may depend, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain arrangements with other companies having sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and the ability of such companies to successfully market and sell any such products. Any failure to enter into such arrangements and marketing alliances on favorable terms, if at all, could delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates and could increase our costs of commercialization. Any use of distribution arrangements and marketing alliances to commercialize our product candidates will subject us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to relinquish important rights to our products or product candidates;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors or collaborators may devote to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour distributors or collaborators may experience financial difficulties;\n\u00b7\nour distributors or collaborators may not devote sufficient time to the marketing and sales of our products; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement.\nIf we are unable to implement our own sales and marketing capability or are unable to contract with one or more third parties for such services on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products in certain markets. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal or external sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our products. If we are not successful in commercializing our products, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we would incur significant additional losses.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining effective patent and other intellectual property protection for our product candidates and proprietary technology.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining effective patent protection and other intellectual property protection of our product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products, if any, will be dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.\nWe are pursuing a multi-faceted IP strategy for levosimendan that includes filing patent applications in the U.S. and Canada that, if granted, could protect the use of levosimendan for subcutaneous administration, levosimendan use in the treatment of PH-HFpEF patients, as well as levosimendan use in combination with various approved drugs to treat cardiovascular conditions. In January 2022, the USPTO granted Tenax Therapeutics a patent protecting the subcutaneous administration of various cyclodextrin based formulations of levosimendan. Our other patent applications are in various stages of review.\nOur strategy to maximize market exclusivity for imatinib relies on two forms of exclusivity. First, we have been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of PAH by the FDA which would provide seven years of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. if our imatinib formulation is the first to receive FDA approval for PAH. In addition, we expect to file one or more applications for patent to cover our imatinib development. If granted, a patent would provide protection for 20 years from its filing date.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biopharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States. The biopharmaceutical patent situation outside the United States is less certain still. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents we own. Further, if any of our patents are deemed invalid and unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u00b7\nothers may be able to make compositions or formulations that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u00b7\nwe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications;\n\u00b7\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u00b7\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nour issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties;\n\u00b7\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n\u00b7\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nWe rely on confidentiality agreements that, if breached, may be difficult to enforce and could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position.\nOur policy is to enter into agreements relating to the non-disclosure and non-use of confidential information with third parties, including our contractors, consultants, advisors and research collaborators, as well as agreements that purport to require the disclosure and assignment to us of the rights to the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we employ them. However, these agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. Moreover, to the extent that our contractors, consultants, advisors and research collaborators apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to the intellectual property. If a dispute arises, a court may determine that the right belongs to a third party, and enforcement of our rights can be costly and unpredictable. In addition, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, consultants, advisors or others. Despite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that:\n\u00b7\nthese agreements may be breached;\n\u00b7\nthese agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach; or\n\u00b7\nour trade secrets or proprietary know-how will otherwise become known.\nAny breach of our confidentiality agreements or our failure to effectively enforce such agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use, our technology.\nIf we or our partners choose to go to court to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that these patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe our rights to these patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our commercialization partners are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. We have agreed to indemnify certain of our commercial partners against certain patent infringement claims brought by third parties. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications, or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents by others covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if, unbeknownst to us, the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nUnder current law, we may not be able to enforce all employees\u2019 covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our former employees.\nWe have entered into non-competition agreements with certain of our employees. These agreements prohibit our employees, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. Under current law, we may be unable to enforce these agreements against certain of our employees and it may be difficult for us to restrict our competitors from gaining the expertise our former employees gained while working for us. If we cannot enforce our employees\u2019 non-compete agreements, we may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of our former employees.\nWe may infringe or be alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties.\nOur products or product candidates may infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, one or more claims of an issued patent or may fall within the scope of one or more claims in a published patent application that may be subsequently issued and to which we do not hold a license or other rights. Third parties may own or control these patents or patent applications in the United States and abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nIf we are found to infringe the patent rights of a third party, or in order to avoid potential claims, we or our collaborators may choose or be required to seek a license from a third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms.\nThere have been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference proceedings declared by the USPTO and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products. Our products, after commercial launch, may become subject to Paragraph IV certification under the Hatch-Waxman Act, thus forcing us to initiate infringement proceedings against such third-party filers. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nSome of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us. We may, however, be subject to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims and, even if we are successful in defending ourselves, could result in substantial costs to us or be distracting to our management. If we fail to defend any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nFuture sales and issuances of shares of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAdditional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities and costs associated with operating as a public company. As of December 31, 2021, we had $5.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. To raise capital, we may, among other things, sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner, we determine from time to time.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2021, we had exercisable outstanding options and warrants (excluding out-of-the-money stock options and warrants) that if exercised would result in the issuance of 20.2 million shares of our common stock. Further, we are authorized to grant equity awards, including stock grants and stock options, to our employees, directors and consultants. As of December 31, 2021, there were 819,750 shares available for future issuance under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended.\nFuture sales or issuances of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, may cause investors to be materially diluted, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to our existing stockholders.\nOur share price has been volatile, and may continue to be volatile, which may subject us to securities class action litigation in the future.\nOur stock price has in the past been, and is likely to be in the future, volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our existing stockholders may not be able to sell their stock at a favorable price. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u00b7\nstatus and/or results of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nstatus of ongoing litigation;\n\u00b7\nresults of clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\nregulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\nactions and decisions by our collaborators or partners;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors\u2019 operating results or changes in their growth rate;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u00b7\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general;\n\u00b7\nstatus of our search and selection of future management and leadership; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and market conditions, including as a result of pandemics, epidemics, or outbreaks of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, or other similar disrupting illnesses, and as a result of geopolitical uncertainties, including tensions in Ukraine.\nSome companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them. Such lawsuits, should they be filed against us in the future, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain this listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements. On February 17, 2022, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Qualifications Department indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the minimum bid price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market closed below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement, or until August 16, 2022, to achieve compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days before August 16, 2022.\nIn addition, on September 9, 2021, we notified Nasdaq that as a result of James Mitchum\u2019s resignation from the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board, the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A), which requires the company\u2019s Audit Committee to be composed of at least three independent directors. The resignation of Mr. Mitchum left the Audit Committee with two independent directors. On September 10, 2021, the Company received a response from Nasdaq acknowledging the Company\u2019s non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A). Such letter further provided that pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(4)(B), the Company was entitled to a cure period to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) through the earlier of the Company\u2019s next annual stockholders\u2019 meeting or September 8, 2022. Effective January 28, 2022, the Board appointed Robyn M. Hunter as a member of the Board and as a member and Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee. As a result of her appointment, on February 17. 2022, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying us that Nasdaq determined that we had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A).\nWhile we intend to engage in efforts to maintain compliance, and thus maintain our listing, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements in the future. If our common stock were removed from listing with The Nasdaq Capital Market, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange, which is the exception on which we currently rely. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market.\nIf our common stock is delisted and there is no longer an active trading market for our shares, it may, among other things:\n\u00b7\ncause stockholders difficulty in selling our shares without depressing the market price for the shares or selling our shares at all;\n\u00b7\nsubstantially impair our ability to raise additional funds;\n\u00b7\nresult in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer financing opportunities for us; and/or\n\u00b7\nresult in potential breaches of representations or covenants of agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements. Claims related to any such breaches, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nA delisting would also reduce the value of our equity compensation plans, which could negatively impact our ability to retain key employees.\nWe have a significant security holder, which could exert substantial influence over our business.\nAs of March 28, 2022, to our knowledge, Armistice Capital, LLC, or Armistice, held 2,019,995 shares of our common stock, warrants to purchase up to 4,773,269 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.97 per share, warrants to purchase up to 2,072,538 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.93 per share, warrants to purchase up to 2,360,313 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.04 per share, warrants to purchase up to 7,783,616 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.903 per share, and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 10,033,274 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share. In addition, two members of our Board of Directors are affiliates of Armistice. Under the terms of the warrants and pre-funded warrants issued to Armistice, Armistice is not permitted to exercise such warrants to the extent that such exercise would result in Armistice (and its affiliates) beneficially owning more than 9.99% (or 4.99% in the case of the warrants with the $1.04 and $1.93 exercise prices per share) of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants. After giving effect to the beneficial ownership limitations currently in effect with respect to the warrants and pre-funded warrants held by Armistice to our knowledge, as of March 28, 2022, Armistice beneficially owned 9.99% of our outstanding common stock. If the warrants and pre-funded warrants held by Armistice could be exercised without the beneficial ownership limitations, then as of March 28, 2022, Armistice would have beneficially owned 53.5% of our common stock.\nAdditionally in connection with a sale of the Company, Armistice would be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants then held by it and without regard to the beneficial ownership limitations imposed on the conversion or exercise of such securities, the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive if such securities had been converted into or exercised for shares of our common stock immediately prior to such sale of our company. Because Armistice would receive this sale consideration with respect to warrants not included in its reported beneficial ownership of our common stock, in the event of a sale of our Company, it would be entitled to receive a significantly larger portion of the total proceeds distributable to the holders of our securities than is represented by its reported beneficial ownership of our common stock.\nAlthough there are contractual limitations on the beneficial ownership of Armistice, if Armistice were to exercise its warrants for common stock, it could be able to exert substantial influence over our business, including, for example, the ability to delay, defer or prevent a change of control, entrench our management and our Board of Directors or delay or prevent a merger, consolidation or other business combination.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, which could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of the Company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by the stockholders. For example, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur organizational documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including provisions that:\n\u00b7\nprovide that vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u00b7\neliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\ngrant the Board of directors the authority to increase or decrease the size of the Board;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nrequire that stockholders give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7\nauthorize the Board of Directors, by a majority vote, to amend the bylaws.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limit the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in stockholder best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that certain investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nOur bylaws contain an exclusive forum provision, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, any North Carolina state court that has jurisdiction, or the Delaware Court of Chancery shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any internal corporate claims, including without limitation (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of us to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants in such action. This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, or any other claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the near future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings and financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as the Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nWe have U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, which expire in various years if not utilized. In addition, we have federal research and development credit carryforwards. The federal research and development credit carryforwards expire in various years if not utilized. Under Sections 382 and 383 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its future post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We have not performed a formal study to determine whether any of our NOLs are subject to these limitations. We have recorded deferred tax assets for our NOLs and research and development credits and have recorded a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets. In the event that it is determined that we have in the past experienced additional ownership changes, or if we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then we may be further limited in our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn in the event that we attain profitability. Any such limitations on the ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in the event that we attain profitability.", "PERMNO": 93237, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "TENX"}
