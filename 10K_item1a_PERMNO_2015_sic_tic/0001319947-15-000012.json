{"cik": "1319947", "company": "DSW Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors when evaluating DSW Inc. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be negatively affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are positioning DSW as an omni-channel retailer and expect to make significant capital investments and have significant expenses related to our omni-channel strategy. Failure to execute our omni-channel strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and how we meet consumer expectations.\nThe omni-channel strategy is a business necessity to meet changing customer experience expectations and an opportunity to create a competitive advantage. It is a business necessity because the DSW customer expects to be able to shop across all sales channels. The omni-channel strategy can also create distance between DSW and single channel competitors as well as multi-channel competitors who either do not operate in an omni-channel way or do not define omni-channel as broadly as DSW intends to define it. We have developed an omni-channel strategy and expect to have continued innovation in our business. We no longer consider our omni-channel strategy as a business initiative, as we see it as a fundamental change of how we plan and operate the business.\nThis strategy will require significant cost investment of cross-functional operations and management focus, along with investment in supporting technologies. The risk is that the execution of our omni-channel strategy could cost more than expected, have fewer benefits than anticipated, distract management from our day-to-day operations, or be unsuccessful. In the event that our omni-channel strategy is unsuccessful, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial results.\nWe opened 37 DSW stores in fiscal 2014, plan to open approximately 35 DSW stores in fiscal 2015 and plan to open 15 to 20 DSW stores in each of the following two to five years, which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOur continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to successfully open and operate new DSW stores on a profitable basis as part of our real estate strategy. During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we opened 37, 30 and 39 new DSW stores, respectively. Included in the 37 new DSW stores in fiscal 2014 were five small format stores. Our small format stores average approximately 12,000 square feet and, if successful, they could pave the way for more small format stores. We plan to open approximately 35 stores in fiscal 2015 and plan to open 15 to 20 stores each year for the following two to five years. As of January 31, 2015, we have signed leases for an additional 34 stores opening in fiscal 2015 and 2016. During fiscal 2014, the average investment in property and equipment, inventory and new store expenses required to open a typical new DSW store was approximately $1.5 million, excluding construction and tenant allowances received from landlords.\nThis continued expansion could place increased demands on our financial, managerial, operational and administrative resources. We may not achieve our planned expansion on a timely and profitable basis or achieve results in new locations similar to those achieved in existing locations in prior periods. Our ability to open and operate new DSW stores on a timely and profitable basis depends on many factors, including our ability to: identify suitable markets and sites for new store locations with financially stable co-tenants and landlords; negotiate favorable lease terms; build-out or refurbish sites on a timely and effective basis; obtain sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores; obtain sufficient financing and capital resources or generate sufficient operating cash flows from operations to fund growth; open new stores at costs not significantly greater than those anticipated; successfully open new DSW stores in markets in which we currently have few or no stores; control the costs of other capital investments associated with store openings; hire, train and retain qualified managers and store personnel; and successfully integrate new stores into our existing infrastructure, operations, management and distribution systems or adapt such infrastructure, operations and systems to accommodate our growth.\nAs a result, we may be unable to open new stores at the rates expected or at all. If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, the opening of new DSW stores could be delayed or prevented, could cost more than anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTo the extent that we open new DSW stores in our existing markets, we may experience reduced net sales in existing stores in those markets. As our store base increases, our stores will become more concentrated in the markets we serve. As a result, the number of customers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on our strong relationships with vendors to purchase brand name and designer merchandise at favorable prices. If these relationships were to be impaired, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient assortment of merchandise at attractive prices, and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing fashion trends, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe generally do not have long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with any vendors and, therefore, our success depends on maintaining strong relationships with our vendors. Our success depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with sufficient inventory to stock our sales channels. If we fail to maintain our relationships with our existing vendors or to enhance the quality of merchandise they supply us, and if we cannot maintain or acquire new vendors of in-season brand name and designer merchandise, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise at favorable prices may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our inability to stock our sales channels with in-season merchandise at attractive prices could result in lower net sales and decreased customer interest in our sales channels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, if our merchandise costs increase due to increased material or labor costs, or other reasons, our ability to respond or the effect of our response could adversely affect our net sales or gross profit. During fiscal 2014, merchandise supplied by three key vendors accounted for approximately 18% of our net sales. The loss of or a reduction in the amount and qualityof merchandise supplied by any one of these vendors could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to anticipate and respond to fashion trends and consumer preferences, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur merchandising strategy is based on having the proper mix of products in each store to attract our target customers or having those products available via our omni-channel capabilities. This requires us to anticipate and respond to numerous and fluctuating variables in fashion trends and other conditions in the markets in which our stores are situated. A variety of factors will affect our ability to maintain the proper mix of products in each store, including: variations in local economic conditions, which could affect our customers\u2019 discretionary spending and their price sensitivity; unanticipated fashion trends; our success in developing and maintaining vendor relationships that provide us access to in-season merchandise at attractive prices; our success in distributing merchandise to our stores in an efficient manner; and changes in weather patterns, which in turn affect consumer preferences. If we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of our customers, we may experience decreases in our net sales and may be forced to increase markdowns in relation to slow-moving merchandise, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss or disruption of our distribution and/or fulfillment centers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFor our DSW stores and affiliated businesses, the majority of our inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our primary distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, where the inventory is then processed, sorted and shipped to one of our pool locations located throughout the country and then on to the stores. Through a third party, we also operate a West Coast facility where shipments bypass our primary distribution center and go directly to one of our pool locations from the West Coast facility. Our inventory can also be shipped directly from our fulfillment center, supported by a third party, to our customers. Through our ship from store capability, our inventory is shipped directly from our DSW stores. Through our drop ship program, inventory is shipped from the vendor's warehouse.\nOur operating results depend on the orderly operation of our receiving and distribution process, which in turn depends on third-party vendors\u2019 adherence to shipping schedules and our effective management of our distribution facilities. We may not anticipate all the changing demands that our expanding operations will impose on our receiving and distribution system, and events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to catastrophic events, labor disagreements or shipping problems, that may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers. While we maintain business interruption and property insurance, in the event our distribution and fulfillment centers shut down for any reason or if we were to incur higher costs and longer lead times in connection with a disruption at our distribution and fulfillment centers, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business.\nIf Stein Mart or Gordmans were to terminate our supply agreements, close a significant number of stores or liquidate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOur supply agreements are typically for multiple years with automatic renewal options as long as either party does not give notice of intent not to renew. For Stein Mart and Gordmans, our contractual termination dates are December 2017 and January 2016, respectively. In addition, the agreements contain provisions that may trigger an earlier termination. For fiscal 2014, the sales from our Affiliated Business Group represented approximately 6% of our total company net sales. In the event of the loss\nof either of these supply agreements, it is unlikely that we would be able to proportionately reduce expenses compared to the reduction of net sales. The performance of our Affiliated Business Group is highly dependent on the performance of Stein Mart and Gordmans. If Stein Mart or Gordmans were to terminate our supply agreements, close a significant number of stores or liquidate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOur sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including seasonal variability.\nOur business is sensitive to customers\u2019 spending patterns, which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic conditions and the general level of economic activity. Our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of other factors affect our sales and quarterly financial performance, including: uncertain U.S. economic conditions and, in particular, the retail sales environment; changes in our merchandising strategy; timing and concentration of new DSW store openings and related new store and other start-up costs; expenses associated with new DSW stores, our omni-channel strategy and marketing expenses; changes in our merchandise mix; changes in and regional variations in demographic and population characteristics; timing of promotional events; seasonal fluctuations due to weather conditions; and actions by our competitors.\nAccordingly, our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter, and comparable sales for any particular future period may increase or decrease. Our future financial performance may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors.\nIn addition, our business is subject to seasonal merchandise trends when our customers\u2019 interest in new seasonal styles increases. New spring styles are introduced in the first quarter, and new fall styles are introduced in the third quarter. As a result of seasonal merchandise trends, any factors negatively affecting us during these periods, including adverse weather, the timing and level of markdowns, fashion trends or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss or disruption of information technology services could affect our ability to implement our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur information systems are an integral part of our growth strategy in efficiently operating our business, in managing operations and protecting against security risks related to our electronic processing and transmitting of confidential customer and associate data. The requirements to keep our information systems operating at peak performance may be higher than anticipated and could strain our capital resources, management of any upgrades and our ability to protect ourselves from any future information security breaches. In addition, any significant disruption of our data center could have a material adverse effect on those operations dependent on those systems, most specifically, store operations, dsw.com, our distribution and fulfillment centers and our merchandising team. While we maintain business interruption and property insurance, in the event our data center was to be shut down, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business, or insurance proceeds may not be received timely.\nWe accept orders through dsw.com and m.dsw.com, the DSW mobile site. We are subject to various risks of operating online and mobile selling capabilities such as: the failure of our information technology infrastructure, including any third-party hardware or software, resulting in downtime or other technical issues; reliance on third-party logistics providers to deliver our products to customers; inability to respond to technological changes; violations of state or federal laws; credit card fraud; or other information security breaches. Failure to mitigate these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face security risks related to our electronic processing of sensitive and confidential customer and associate data; which data, if breached, could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGiven the nature of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer data, including credit card information. Despite our current security measures, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are vulnerable to information security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses or other similar attacks. An information security breach involving the disclosure of confidential data could damage our reputation and our customers' willingness to shop in our stores, on dsw.com and m.dsw.com, and subject us to possible legal liability. In addition, we may incur material remediation costs as a result of an information security breach, including liability for stolen customer or associate data, repairing system damage or providing credit monitoring or other benefits to customers or associates affected by the breach. While we have insurance, in the event we experience an information security breach, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business, or insurance proceeds may not be received timely. Failure to mitigate these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to retain our existing senior management team and to continue to attract qualified new personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization which requires an experienced and talented management team. If we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of any of our key executive and buying personnel, our business could be adversely affected. We have entered into employment agreements with several key executives and also offer compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent. Furthermore, our ability to manage our expansion will require us to continue to train, motivate and develop our employees to maintain a high level of talent for future challenges and succession planning. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business.\nWe are dependent on our DSW Rewards program and marketing to drive traffic, sales and loyalty, and any decrease in membership or purchases from members could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDSW Rewards is a customer loyalty program that we rely on to drive customer traffic, sales and loyalty. DSW Rewards members earn reward certificates that offer discounts on future purchases. In both fiscal 2014 and 2013, shoppers in the loyalty program generated approximately 90% of DSW sales. As of January 31, 2015, approximately 23 million members were enrolled in DSW Rewards and have made at least one purchase over the course of the last two fiscal years, compared to approximately 22 million members as of February 1, 2014. In the event that our DSW Rewards members do not continue to shop at DSW or the number of members decreases, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are constantly exploring new business opportunities. The failure to successfully execute our plans may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe continued development of new business opportunities could distract management from our core business. In the event that we lose focus on our core business or are unsuccessful in the execution of our concept, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risk through leases of certain portions of our properties.\nIn fiscal 2012, we purchased our corporate office headquarters, our distribution center and a trailer parking lot. Certain portions of the properties are leased to both unrelated and related parties, which provides rental income. The largest tenant's lease, which is not with a related party, renewed for another two-year term in June 2013, but either party can terminate after each two-year renewal option and the tenant can terminate at any time with 60 days notice. In the event that one or more tenants do not renew their leases, the foregoing circumstances or events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn connection with the Merger, Merger Sub assumed RVI\u2019s responsibilities under a lease dated September 2003 for an office building in Columbus, Ohio (the \"Premises\"). In April 2005, RVI sublet the Premises to an unrelated third party at a rent that is lower than its expenses under the lease. In fiscal 2012, DSW Inc. assumed responsibility for the lease. The sublease is through the lease expiration date, but either party can terminate after each two-year renewal option. Merger Sub remains liable under the lease through the lease expiration date in 2024, and if the subtenant does not pay the rent or vacates the Premises, Merger Sub would be required to make full rent payments to the landlord without any rental income. All of the foregoing circumstances or events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the External Environment\nWe may be unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe retail footwear market is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, both small and large, including department stores, mall-based shoe stores, national chains, independent shoe retailers, single-brand specialty retailers, online shoe retailers, multi-channel specialty retailers and brand-oriented discounters. Our success depends on our ability to remain competitive with respect to style, price, brand availability and customer service. The performance of our competitors, as well as a change in their pricing policies as a result of the current economic environment, marketing activities and other business strategies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to identify and respond to rapidly changing customer behavior and the impact that social media and comparison shopping has on our customer could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on foreign sources for our merchandise, and our business is therefore subject to risks associated with international trade.\nWe purchase merchandise from domestic and foreign vendors. In addition, many of our domestic vendors import a large portion of their merchandise from abroad, primarily from China, Brazil and Italy. We believe that almost all the merchandise we purchased during fiscal 2014 was manufactured outside the United States, and the majority was manufactured in China. For this reason, we face risks inherent in purchasing from foreign suppliers, such as: economic and political instability in countries where these suppliers are located; international hostilities or acts of war or terrorism affecting the United States or foreign countries from which our merchandise is sourced; increases in shipping costs; transportation delays and interruptions, including increased inspections of import shipments by domestic authorities; work stoppages; U.S. laws affecting the importation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas and other non-tariff barriers; expropriation or nationalization; changes in foreign government administration and governmental policies; changes in import duties or quotas; compliance with trade and foreign tax laws; and local business practices, including compliance with foreign laws and with domestic and international labor standards.\nWe require our vendors to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our internal requirements. However, we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRestrictions in our secured revolving credit facility and letter of credit agreement could limit our operational flexibility.\nWe have a $50 million secured revolving credit agreement and a $50 million letter of credit agreement with terms expiring July 2018 and August 2018, respectively. The secured revolving credit agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of our personal property assets and its subsidiaries with certain exclusions and may be used to provide funds for general corporate purposes, to provide for ongoing working capital requirements, and to make permitted acquisitions. In addition, both the secured revolving credit agreement and the letter of credit agreement contain restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business. These covenants, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to grant liens on our assets, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, limit our capital expenditures to $200 million annually (the secured revolving credit agreement only), limit our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another entity. These covenants could restrict our operational flexibility, and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the secured revolving credit facility and, in certain circumstances, may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment.\nUncertain economic conditions in the United States and other world events can adversely affect consumer confidence and consumer spending habits, which could result in reduced net sales.\nConsumer spending habits, including spending for the footwear and accessories that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers\u2019 disposable income. Consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. The outbreak or escalation of war, natural disasters, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the United States, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. In an economic slowdown, we could experience lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis and be forced to delay or slow our expansion plans. Reduced net sales may result in reduced operating cash flows if we are not able to appropriately manage inventory levels or leverage expenses. These negative economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur cash and investments are subject to risks that could affect the liquidity of these investments.\nAs of January 31, 2015, we had cash and investments of approximately $447 million. A portion of these are held as cash in operating accounts that are with third-party financial institutions. While we regularly monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and when possible adjust the balances as appropriate to be within Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance limits, these cash balances could be lost or inaccessible if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nWhile we generally invest in lower risk investments, investment risk has been and may further be exacerbated by credit and liquidity issues that have affected various sectors of the financial markets. Our access to cash and investments, their earning potential or our ability to invest in highly rated, low risk investments may be impacted by adverse conditions in the U.S. financial markets. These market risks associated with our cash and investments could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur amended articles of incorporation, amended and restated code of regulations and Ohio state law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of DSW. This could adversely affect the value of our Common Shares.\nOur amended articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares and to determine the powers, preferences, privileges, rights, including voting rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions on those shares, without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of our Class A Common Shares will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred shares could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control and could adversely affect the voting power of our Common Shares.\nIn addition, provisions of our amended articles of incorporation, amended and restated code of regulations and Ohio law, together or separately, could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control or limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Common Shares. Among other things, these provisions establish a staggered board, require a supermajority vote to remove directors, and establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders\u2019 meetings.\nWe do not expect a trading market for DSW Class B Common Shares to develop and therefore any investment in DSW Class B Common Shares may be effectively illiquid, unless such DSW Class B Common Shares are converted into DSW Class A Common Shares.\nThere is currently no public market for DSW Class B Common Shares. DSW does not intend to list the Class B Common Shares on any securities exchange or any automated quotation system. As a result, there can be no assurance that a secondary market will develop, and we do not expect any market makers to participate in a secondary market. Trading activity, if any, in the DSW Class B Common Shares will be very limited. Because the DSW Class B Common Shares are not listed on a securities exchange or an automated quotation system, it may be difficult to obtain pricing information with respect to the shares. Accordingly, there may be a limited number of buyers if a holder decided to sell their DSW Class B Common Shares. This may affect the price a holder would receive upon such sale. Alternatively, a holder of DSW Class B Common Shares could convert them into DSW Class A Common Shares prior to selling. However, such conversion could affect the timing of any such sale, which may in turn affect the price a holder may receive upon such sale.\nRisks Relating to our Relationship with the Schottenstein Affiliates\nThe Schottenstein Affiliates, entities owned by or controlled by Jay L. Schottenstein, the executive chairman of the DSW board of directors, and members of his family, directly control or substantially influence the outcome of matters submitted for DSW shareholder votes, and their interests may differ from DSW\u2019s other shareholders.\nAs of January 31, 2015, the Schottenstein Affiliates have approximately 49% of the voting power of the outstanding DSW Common Shares. The Schottenstein Affiliates directly control or substantially influence the outcome of all matters submitted to DSW\u2019s shareholders for approval, including the election of directors, approval of mergers or other business combinations, and acquisitions or dispositions of assets. The interests of the Schottenstein Affiliates may differ from or be opposed to the interests of DSW\u2019s other shareholders, and their level of ownership and voting power in DSW may have the effect of delaying or preventing a subsequent change in control that may be favored by other DSW shareholders.\nThe Schottenstein Affiliates engage in a variety of businesses, including, but not limited to, business and inventory liquidations, apparel companies and real estate investments. Opportunities may arise in the area of potential competitive business activities that may be attractive to the Schottenstein Affiliates and us. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that the Schottenstein Affiliates are under no obligation to communicate or offer any corporate opportunity to us. In addition, the Schottenstein Affiliates have the right to engage in similar activities as us, do business with our suppliers and customers, and except as limited by the Master Separation Agreement with RVI, employ or otherwise engage any of our officers or employees. The provisions of the Master Separation Agreement with RVI also outline how opportunities are to be assigned in the event that our or the Schottenstein Affiliates' directors and officers learn of opportunities.\nRisks Relating to our Merger with Retail Ventures, Inc.\nPrior to the Merger, RVI had actual liabilities and significant contingent liabilities. As of the effective time of the Merger, Merger Sub, a subsidiary of DSW, assumed RVI's obligations with respect to these actual liabilities and contingent liabilities, if they become actual liabilities, which could adversely affect DSW\u2019s financial condition.\nMerger Sub assumed the obligations of RVI for a guaranteed lease obligation. On November 2, 2011, Syms and Filene\u2019s Basement filed for bankruptcy protection. RVI guaranteed the obligations of Filene\u2019s Basement in connection with a lease for the Union Square location. Merger Sub may be responsible for any obligations of RVI under this guaranty.\nThe landlord at the Union Square location filed a claim against the Filene's/Syms estate for losses incurred in connection with the lease rejection in bankruptcy. The landlord also filed a lawsuit against Merger Sub seeking payment under the guaranty. On February 27, 2015, the parties jointly entered into a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement that provides for the settlement of the litigation and certain claims arising from the Filene's/Syms bankruptcy. The guaranty remains in effect through lease expiration.\nIn addition, if our assumptions or estimates regarding the amount of any actual or contingent liabilities were incorrect or become incorrect due to changes in economic conditions, among other reasons, this could cause the amount of any actual liability to exceed the amounts estimated, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Relating to our Equity Investment in Town Shoes Limited\nWe will be exposed to investment risk with the acquisition of an equity interest in Town Shoes.\nIn May 2014, DSW acquired a 49% equity interest in Town Shoes. DSW is exposed to risk of the success of the Town Shoes business. DSW is also exposed to risk of adverse reactions to the transaction or changes to business relationships; competitive responses; inability to maintain key personnel and changes in general economic conditions in Canada. If Town Shoes fails to perform to our expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe will be exposed to foreign currency risk with the acquisition of an equity interest in Town Shoes.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through our equity in Town Shoes' earnings and the shareholder note that we hold. We currently do not utilize hedging instruments to mitigate foreign currency exchange risks.", "PERMNO": 90751, "SIC": 5661, "TIC": "DBI"}
