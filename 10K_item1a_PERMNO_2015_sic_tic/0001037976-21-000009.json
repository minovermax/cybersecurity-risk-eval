RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks that based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular service lines or geographies, while others could affect all of our businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated.\nThese risk factors do not identify all risks we face; our operations could also be affected by factors not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be not significant to our operations. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties which broadly affect all companies.\nGeneral Overview. Our business environment is complex, dynamic and international. Accordingly, it is subject to a number of significant risks in the ordinary course of its operations. If we cannot or do not successfully manage the risks associated with the services we provide, our operations, business, operating results, reputation and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOne of the challenges of a global business such as ours is to determine in a sophisticated manner the critical enterprise risks that exist or may newly develop over time as our business evolves. We must then determine how best to employ reasonably available resources to prevent, mitigate and/or minimize those risks we identify as having the greatest potential to cause significant damage from an operational, financial, or reputational standpoint.\nOur Board and its Committees take active roles in overseeing management's identification, disclosure and mitigation of enterprise risks. Our ongoing enterprise risk management efforts have significantly shaped the following risk factors and their discussion.\nCategorization of Enterprise Risks. This section reflects our current views, as of the issuance of this report, concerning the most significant risks we believe our business faces, both in the short and long term. For purposes of the following analysis and discussion, we group the risks we face according to five principal categories:\n\u2022 Operational Risk Factors \u2022 Financial Risk Factors\n\u2022 Strategic Risk Factors \u2022 General Risk Factors\n\u2022 Legal and Compliance Risk Factors\nWe could appropriately place some of the risks we identify in more than one category, but we have chosen the one category we view as primary. We do not present the risks below in their order of significance, the relative likelihood we will experience a loss, or the magnitude of any such loss. Certain of these risks also may give rise to business opportunities for us, but our discussion of risk factors in Item 1A is limited to the adverse effects the risks may have on our business.\nOperational Risk Factors\nOperational risk relates to risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the operation of our businesses. It includes information management and data protection and security, including cyber security; supply chain and business disruption, including health and safety; and other risks, including human resources and reputation.\nREPUTATIONAL AND BRAND RISKS.\nThe value and premium status of our brand is one of our most important assets. An inherent risk in maintaining our brand is that we may fail to successfully differentiate the scope and quality of our service and product offerings from those of our competitors, or that we may fail to sufficiently innovate or develop improved products or services that will be attractive to our clients.\nThe rapid dissemination and increasing transparency of information, particularly for public companies, increases the risks to our business that could result from negative media or announcements about ethics lapses or other operational problems, which could lead clients to terminate or reduce their relationships with us. As such, any negative media, allegations or litigation against us, irrespective of the final outcome, could potentially harm our professional reputation and damage our business. We are also subject to misappropriation of one of the names or trademarks we own by third parties that do not have the right to use them so they can benefit from the goodwill we have built up in our intellectual property; further, our efforts to police usage of our intellectual property may not be successful in all situations.\nCOMPETITION FOR TALENT WORLD-WIDE; SUCCESSION OF KEY LEADERS.\nWe depend, in large part, on the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and strategy, as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships. Our business depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge, including our senior management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to successfully plan for succession of employees holding key management positions, our business and operating results could suffer. There is a further risk of losing talent (and intellectual property and client contacts) to competitors, particularly in the context of increased use of social media networks and transparency of employment information. There is also the risk of losing top producers who provide a material margin contribution. These risks increase as we continue to grow as an organization and increase the number of staff, which has expanded significantly over the past decade. There may also be an increase in recruitment and compensation costs. We and our competitors use equity incentives and bonuses to help attract, retain and incentivize key personnel. As competition is significant for the services of such personnel, the expense of incentives and bonuses may increase and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent we have in the past.\nThe challenge to find and retain sufficiently trained staff is world-wide, including within emerging markets, and as a result, increases the risk of performance for clients. In particular, in successful emerging markets such as India and China, attrition by highly informed and mobile staff is a challenge for all companies. Labor costs are rising in emerging economies and are expected to increase further. Corporate payrolls are likely to increase as greater competition for labor and social pressure to raise salaries in line with productivity growth cause even greater wage inflation. It is increasingly challenging to predict regional and national labor policies, as well as regulations. The indirect implications of these changes are difficult to assess.\nTHIRD PARTY SPEND MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK.\nWe rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to perform activities on behalf of our organization to improve quality, increase efficiencies, reduce costs and lower operational risks across our business and support functions. We have instituted a Vendor Code of Conduct, which is published in multiple languages on our website, and which is intended to communicate to our vendors the standards of conduct we expect them to uphold. Our contracts with vendors also generally impose a contractual obligation to comply with our Vendor Code. In addition, we leverage technology at an increasing rate to help us better screen vendors, with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of the risks posed to our business by potential and existing vendors. If our third parties do not have the proper safeguards and controls in place, or appropriate oversight cannot be provided, we could be exposed to increased operational, regulatory, financial or reputational risks. A failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of peak demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, these third parties face their own technology, operating, business and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee or company information, could cause damage to our reputation and harm to our business.\nOur contractors and their subcontractors are more integrated into our operations than ever before and, as a result, also involved in a significant proportion of the safety incidents we experience. Health and safety is a prominent part of our Beyond strategy, so we take steps to engage with our supply chain and improve our safety performance. This includes producing a dedicated Global Health and Safety Report detailing our approach to managing this important topic. Our goal is to ensure those we work and interact with are unharmed by our operations. We have a multi-disciplinary safety management structure, with executive sponsorship, aimed at managing existing and emerging health and safety risks, and achieving continuous improvement. However, despite investment in our safety platform, management systems and vendor due diligence program, additional efforts are necessary to ensure vendors are aware of our high health and safety expectations.\nWE FACE POTENTIAL BUSINESS DISRUPTION AND RELATED RISKS RESULTING FROM HEALTH EPIDEMICS, ESPECIALLY THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC.\nHealth epidemics that affect the general conduct of business in one or more urban areas (including as the result of travel restrictions and the inability to conduct face-to-face meetings), such as occurred in the past from influenza, occurring at present (COVID-19) or may occur in the future from other types of outbreak, can also adversely affect the volume of business transactions, real estate markets and the cost of operating real estate or providing real estate services.\nAt present, efforts to contain and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic are occurring in many countries where we operate, including the United States. The actions taken have resulted in unprecedented restrictions on businesses, including closures, with a substantial reduction in economic activity in most countries. The pandemic had a material effect on our financial results in 2020. Our transaction-based services lines had a significant year-over-year decline in activity as non-essential transactions were delayed, reduced in scope or cancelled, particularly in the last nine months of 2020. Certain costs in our operating structure are fixed in nature and given the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and its human and economic impact, immediate cuts to these fixed costs to mirror the declines in revenues were not practical.\nSignificant uncertainty remains as to the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and on the global economy as a whole, including potential changes in commercial behavior. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to pre-pandemic levels. We expect the ultimate significance of the impact of these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response. COVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses, particularly over the near to medium term.\nTECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT OF DATA.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to collect, use, store and manage organizational and client data. If any of our information and data management systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, loss of client data, loss of employee data, regulatory intervention, breach of confidentiality or other contract provisions, or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events wholly or partially beyond our control, including disruptions of electrical or communications services, disruptions caused by natural disasters, political instability, terrorist attacks, sabotage, computer viruses, or problems with the internet, deliberate attempts to disrupt our computer systems through \"hacking,\" \"phishing,\" or other forms of cyber attack, or our inability to occupy one or more of our office locations. As we outsource significant portions of our information technology functions to third-party providers, such as cloud computing, we bear the risk of having somewhat less direct control over the manner and quality of performance.\nWe are exposed to the risk of cyber attacks in the normal course of business. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. We continue to observe an increased level of cyber threats focused on gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.\nWe have experienced various types of cyber attack incidents, which to-date have been contained and have not been material to us as a whole. As the result of such incidents, we have continued to implement new controls, governance, technical protections and other procedures. We may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences such as liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs and experience material harm to our business and financial results if we fall victim to other successful cyber attacks.\nThe legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide continues to evolve. We collect personally identifiable information (\"PII\") and other data as part of our business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation, for example, imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides significant penalties for noncompliance. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to us or company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nCONCENTRATIONS OF BUSINESS WITH CORPORATE AND INVESTOR CLIENTS CAUSE INCREASED CREDIT RISK AND GREATER IMPACT FROM THE LOSS OF CERTAIN CLIENTS AND INCREASED RISKS FROM HIGHER LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN CONTRACTS.\nWe value the expansion of business relationships with individual corporate clients and institutional investors because of the increased efficiency and economics (both to our clients and us) that can result from developing repeat business and performing an increasingly broad range of services for the same client. Having increasingly large and concentrated clients also can lead to greater or more concentrated risks of loss if, among other possibilities, such a client (i) experiences its own financial problems, which can lead to larger individual credit risks; (ii) becomes bankrupt or insolvent, which can lead to our failure to be paid for services we have previously provided or funds we have previously advanced; (iii) decides to reduce its operations or its real estate facilities; (iv) makes a change in its real estate strategy, such as no longer outsourcing its real estate operations; (v) decides to change its providers of real estate services; or (vi) merges with another corporation or otherwise undergoes a change of control, which may result in new management taking over with a different real estate philosophy or in different relationships with other real estate providers. In the case of LaSalle, concentration of investor clients can lead to fewer sources of investment capital, which can negatively affect assets under management in case a higher-volume client withdraws its funds or does not re-invest them. This is also the case within LaSalle's businesses which are dependent on the continued ability and willingness of certain brokerage firms to attract investment funds from their clients.\nIn addition, competitive conditions, particularly in connection with increasingly large clients, may require us to compromise on certain contract terms with respect to the payment of fees, the extent of risk transfer, or acting as principal rather than agent in connection with supplier relationships, liability limitations, credit terms and other contractual terms, or in connection with disputes or potential litigation. Where competitive pressures result in higher levels of potential liability under our contracts, the cost of operational errors and other activities for which we have indemnified our clients will be greater and may not be fully insured.\nPERFORMANCE AND FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS UNDER CLIENT CONTRACTS; RISING COST OF INSURANCE RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS; RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY OF CONTRACTORS; SCOPE CREEP.\nIn certain cases, we are subject to fiduciary obligations to our clients, which may result in a higher level of legal obligation compared to basic contractual obligations. These relate to, among other matters, the decisions we make on behalf of a client with respect to managing assets on its behalf or purchasing products or services from third parties or other divisions within our Company. Our services may involve handling substantial amounts of client funds in connection with managing their properties or complicated and high-profile transactions. We face legal and reputational risks in the event we do not perform, or are perceived to have not performed, under those contracts or in accordance with those obligations, or in the event we are negligent in the handling of client funds or in the way in which we have delivered our professional services. The increased potential for the fraudulent diversion of funds from a \"hacking\" or \"phishing\" attack exacerbates these risks.\nThe precautions we take to prevent these types of occurrences, which represent a significant commitment of corporate resources, may nevertheless be ineffective in certain cases. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could have an adverse effect on profit margins.\nIf we perform services for clients beyond, or different from, what were originally contemplated in the governing contracts (known as \"scope creep\"), we may not be fully reimbursed for the services provided, realize our full compensation potential or our potential liability in the case of a negligence claim may not have been as limited as it normally would have been or may be unclear.\nCORPORATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.\nAll providers of professional services to clients, including our Company, must manage potential conflicts of interest. This occurs principally where the primary duty of loyalty we owe to one client may potentially be weakened or compromised by a relationship we also maintain with another client or third party. Corporate conflicts of interest arise in the context of the services we provide as a company to our different clients. Personal conflicts of interest on the part of our employees are separately considered as issues within the context of our Code of Business Ethics. Our failure or inability to identify, disclose and resolve potential conflicts of interest in a significant situation could have a material adverse effect. In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions, regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for certain parties where potential conflicts may exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets. There can be no assurance potential conflicts of interest will not adversely affect us.\nAfter reductions in the market values of the underlying properties, firms engaged in the business of providing valuations are inherently subject to a higher risk of claims with respect to conflicts of interest based on the circumstances of valuations they previously issued. Regardless of the ultimate merits of these claims, the allegations themselves can cause reputational damage and can be expensive to defend in terms of counsel fees and otherwise.\nStrategic Risk Factors\nStrategic risk relates to JLL\u2019s future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with: the global macro-environment in which we operate; mergers and acquisitions and restructuring activities; intellectual property; and other risks, including the demand for our services, competitive threats, technology and innovation, and public policy.\nDISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, INNOVATION AND COMPETITION.\nMobile technologies and online collaboration tools are transforming how business gets done. Information technology has entered a \u201cbig data\u201d era. The evolution of digital and information technology presents significant challenges for businesses and societies, which must find ways to capture the benefits of new technologies while dealing with the new threats those technologies present. Within the real estate services industry, managing big data is a critical competitive differentiator and we risk being surpassed if our peers leverage big data more effectively.\nABILITY TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\nOur business depends, in part, on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property such as our service marks, domain names, client lists and information, business methods and technology innovations, and platforms we may create or acquire. Existing laws of some countries in which we provide or intend to provide services, or the extent to which their laws are actually enforced, may offer only limited protections of our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements, and on patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, we hold various trademarks and trade names, including our principal trade names, \"JLL\" and \"LaSalle.\" If either of our registered trade names were to expire or terminate, our competitive position in certain markets could be materially and adversely affected. Our inability to detect unauthorized use (for example, by current or former employees) or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot be sure the intellectual property we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients do not infringe on the rights of third parties. Although, we do obtain representations and warranties, as well as indemnities, from the licensors in order to mitigate this risk. We may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients. These claims may harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services.\nGENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS.\nThe success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions. Further, our business and financial conditions correlate strongly to local, national and regional economic and political conditions or, at least, the perceptions of and confidence in those conditions.\nWe have previously experienced and expect in the future that we will be negatively impacted by periods of economic slowdown or recession and corresponding declines in the demand for real estate and related services. The global economic crisis during the 2007-2009 period was extraordinary for its worldwide scope, severity and impact on major financial institutions, as well as for the extent of governmental stimulus and regulatory responses. Since then, many of our markets have been affected generally by various economic uncertainties, among them: continued significant volatility in oil and commodity prices; the developing effects of climate change and severe weather; and the continued uncertainty on the direction of global tax policy. Most recently, we have continued to assess the potential adverse effects of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic on general economic conditions.\nIn this environment, we have continued to grow our business largely by gaining market share and as the result of targeted acquisitions. It is inherently difficult for us to predict how these types of significant global forces will affect our business in the future and whether we will continue to be able to generate revenue growth to the same extent as we have in the past.\nNegative economic conditions and declines in demand for real estate and related services in several markets or in significant markets could have a material adverse effect on our performance driven by (i) a decline in acquisition and disposition activity, (ii) a decline in real estate values and performance, leasing activity and rental rates, (iii) a decline in value of real estate securities, (iv) the cyclicality in the real estate markets; lag in recovery relative to broader markets, or (v) the effect of changes in non-real estate markets.\nPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY: PROTECTIONISM; TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.\nGlobal events could affect our business. These include the possibility of protectionist economic policies of the United States or foreign governments, the escalation of terrorist attacks and their increasing unpredictability, health epidemics, changing immigration policies of the United States or foreign governments and the increasing globalization of our multinational clients, which creates pressure to further expand our own geographical reach into less developed countries.\nWe provide services in over 80 countries with varying degrees of political and economic stability and transparency. For example, within the past few years, certain emerging as well as mature countries in which we operate have experienced serious political and economic instability that will likely continue to arise from time to time. In recent years there have been significant political changes in several countries where we have significant operations, resulting in changes to financial, tax, tariffs, healthcare, governance, immigration and other laws that may directly affect our business and continue to evolve.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on January 31, 2020 and the ongoing uncertainty with respect to the future relationship of the United Kingdom and the European Union, notwithstanding the impact of the provisional free-trade agreement entered into between the United Kingdom and the European Union on December 24, 2020, may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere. The economic conditions and outlook could be further adversely affected by (i) new or modified trading arrangements between the United Kingdom and other countries, (ii) the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or (iii) the risk the euro as the single currency of the Eurozone could cease to exist. Any of these developments, or the perception any of these developments are likely to occur, could significantly affect economic growth or business activity in the United Kingdom or the European Union, and could result in the relocation of businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic recession or depression, and impact the stability of the financial markets, availability of credit, currency exchange rates, interest rates, financial institutions, and political, financial and monetary systems. Any of these developments could affect our businesses, liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nREAL ESTATE SERVICES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.\nWe provide a broad range of commercial real estate and investment management services. Depending on the service, we may face significant competition from other real estate service providers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms, technology firms, consulting firms, co-locating providers, temporary space providers and firms providing outsourcing of various types (including technology and building products), any of which may be a global, regional or local firm, and from firms that self-perform their real estate services with in-house capabilities.\nMany of our competitors are local or regional firms, which may be substantially smaller in size than we are but hold a larger share of a specific local market. Some of our competitors have expanded the services they offer in an attempt to gain additional business. Some may be providing outsourced facility management services to sell clients products that we do not offer. In some sectors of our business, particularly Corporate Solutions, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have. Larger or better-capitalized competitors in those sectors may be able to respond faster to the need for technological change, price their services more aggressively, compete more effectively for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions more easily, develop innovative products more effectively, and generally compete more aggressively for market share. This can also lead to increasing commoditization of the services we provide and increasing downward pressure on the fees we can charge.\nNew competitors, or alliances among competitors that increase their ability to service clients, could emerge and gain market share, develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, aggressively recruit our people at above-market compensation, develop a descriptive technology that captures market share, or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services we offer. Some of these may come from non-traditional sources, such as information aggregators or digital technology firms. To respond to increased competition and pricing pressure, we may have to lower our prices, loosen contractual terms (such as liability limitations), develop our own innovative approaches to mining data and using information, develop our own disruptive technologies, or increase compensation, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and profit margins. We may also need to become increasingly productive and efficient in the way we deliver services, or with respect to the cost structure supporting our businesses, which may in turn require more innovative uses of technology as well as data gathering and data mining.\nOur industry has continued to consolidate, and there is an inherent risk competitive firms may be more successful than we are at growing through merger and acquisition activity. While we have successfully grown organically and through a series of acquisitions, sourcing and completing acquisitions are complex and sensitive activities. Considering the continuing need to provide clients with more comprehensive services on a more productive and cost-efficient basis, we expect acquisition opportunities to continue to emerge. However, there is no assurance we will be able to continue our acquisition activity in the future at the same pace as we have in the past, particularly as we weigh acquisition opportunities against other potential uses of capital for technology and other investments in systems and human resources, as well as returning capital to shareholders.\nVarious factors may in some cases lead to a willingness on the part of a competitor to engage in aggressive pricing, advertising or hiring practices in order to maintain market share or client relationships. To the extent this occurs, it increases the competitive risks and the fee and compensation pressures we face, although ramifications will differ from one competitor to another given their different positions within the marketplace and their different financial situations.\nWe are substantially dependent on long-term client relationships and on revenue received for services under various service agreements. In this competitive market, if we are unable to maintain these relationships or are otherwise unable to retain existing clients and develop new clients, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Weaknesses in the markets in which they themselves compete may lead to additional pricing pressure from clients as they themselves came under financial pressure.\nTHE SEASONALITY OF OUR REAL ESTATE SERVICES BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO RISKS.\nWithin our Real Estate Services business, our revenue and profits have historically grown progressively by quarter throughout the year mostly due to completing or documenting transactions by fiscal year-end and the fact that certain of our expenses are constant through the year. Historically, we have reported a relatively smaller profit in the first quarter and then increasingly larger profits during each of the following three quarters, excluding the recognition of investment-generated performance fees and co-investment equity gains or losses, each of which can vary from period to period.\nThe seasonality of our business makes it difficult to determine during the course of the year whether planned results will be achieved, and thus to budget, and to adjust to changes in expectations. In addition, negative economic or other conditions that arise at a time when they impact performance in the fourth quarter, such as the particular timing of when larger transactions close or changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies occur, may have a more pronounced impact than if they occurred earlier in the year. To the extent we are not able to identify and adjust for changes in expectations, or we are confronted with negative conditions that disproportionately impact the fourth quarter of a calendar year, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nGrowth in our property management and integrated facilities management businesses and other services related to the growth of outsourcing of corporate real estate services has, to an extent, lessened the seasonality in our revenue and profits during the past few years. However, we believe some level of seasonality will always be inherent to our industry and outside of our control, as was the case in 2020.\nRISKS INHERENT IN MAKING ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES.\nHistorically, a significant component of our growth has been generated by acquisitions. Any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part on the continued availability of suitable acquisitions at favorable prices and with advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us.\nAcquisitions subject us to several significant risks, any of which may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits or synergies of the acquisition. The integration of companies is a complex and time-consuming process that could significantly disrupt the businesses of JLL and the acquired company such as: diversion of management attention, failure to identify certain liabilities and issues during the due diligence process, and the inability to retain personnel and clients of the acquired business.\nTo a much lesser degree, we have occasionally entered into joint ventures to conduct certain businesses or enter new geographies, and we will consider doing so in appropriate situations in the future. Joint ventures have many of the same risk characteristics as acquisitions, particularly with respect to the due diligence and ongoing relationship with joint venture partners, given each partner has inherently less control in a joint venture and will be subject to the authority and economics of the particular structure that is negotiated. Accordingly, we may not have the authority to direct the management and policies of the joint venture. If a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interests, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCO-INVESTMENT, INVESTMENT AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES.\nAn important part of our business strategy includes investing in real estate, both individually and along with our investment management clients. As of December 31, 2020, we have unfunded commitment obligations of up to $320.7 million to fund future co-investments. To remain competitive with well-capitalized financial services firms, we also may make merchant banking investments for which we may use our capital to acquire properties before the related investment management funds have been established or investment commitments have been received from third-party clients.\nCertain service lines we operate have the acquisition, development, management and sale of real estate as part of their strategy. Investing in any of these types of situations exposes us to several risks.\nInvesting in real estate for the above reasons poses the following risks:\n\u2022We may lose some or all the capital we invest if the investments underperform. Real estate investments can underperform as the result of many factors outside of our control, including the general reduction in asset values within a particular geography or asset class. Starting in 2007 and continuing through 2009, for example, real estate prices in many markets declined as the result of the significant tightening of credit markets and the effects of recessionary economies and significant unemployment. Looking presently at the three years ended December 31, 2020, we had no notable impairment activity.\n\u2022We will have fluctuations in earnings and cash flow as we recognize gains or losses, and receive cash upon the disposition of investments, the timing of which is geared toward the benefit of our clients.\n\u2022We generally hold our investments in real estate through subsidiaries with limited liability; however, in certain circumstances, it is possible this limited exposure may be expanded in the future based on, among other things, changes in applicable laws. To the extent this occurs, our liability could exceed the amount we have invested.\n\u2022We make co-investments in real estate in many countries, and this presents tax, political/legislative, currency, and other risks as described elsewhere in this Item.\nIn certain situations, we raise funds from outside investors where we are the sponsor of real estate investments, developments, or projects. To the extent we return less than the investors' original investments because the investments, developments, or projects have underperformed relative to expectations, the investors could attempt to recoup the full amount of their investments under securities law theories such as lack of adequate disclosure when funds were initially raised. Sponsoring funds into which retail investors can invest, such as the investment funds sponsored by LaSalle, may increase this risk.\nLegal and Compliance Risk Factors\nLegal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment and action, and legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures. Government and regulatory risks include the risk that government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or cause us to have to change our business models or practices.\nBURDEN OF COMPLYING WITH MULTIPLE AND POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND DEALING WITH CHANGES IN LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.\nWe face a broad range of legal and regulatory environments in the countries in which we do business. Coordinating our activities to deal with these requirements presents significant challenges.\nChanges in legal and regulatory requirements can impact our ability to engage in business in certain jurisdictions or increase the cost of doing so. The legal requirements of U.S. statutes may also conflict with local legal requirements in a particular country. Avoiding regulatory pitfalls as a result of conflicting laws will continue to be a key focus as non-U.S. statutory law and court decisions create more ambiguity. The jurisdictional reach of laws may be unclear as well, such as when laws in one country purport to regulate the behavior of our subsidiaries or affiliates operating in another country.\nIdentifying the regulations with which we must comply and then complying with them is complex. We may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations, as a result of which we could be subject to regulatory actions and fines for non-compliance. We are also seeing increasing levels of labor regulation in emerging markets, such as China, which affect many of our businesses.\nOur global operations must comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage. Such prohibitions exist regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Although we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition.\nU.S. laws and regulations govern the provision of products and services to, and of other trade-related activities involving, certain targeted countries and parties. As a result, we have had longstanding policies and procedures to restrict or prohibit sales of our services into countries subject to embargoes and sanctions, or to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran. In conjunction with such policies, we have also implemented certain procedures to evaluate whether existing or potential clients appear on the \"Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List\" maintained by OFAC.\nChanges in governments or majority political parties may result in significant changes in enforcement priorities with respect to employment, health and safety, tax, securities disclosure and other regulations, which, in turn, could negatively affect our business.\nLICENSING AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.\nThe brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions; multifamily real estate lending; servicing and asset management; property management; construction; mobile engineering; conducting valuations; trading in securities for clients; and the operation of the investment advisory business, among other business lines, may require us to maintain licenses in various jurisdictions in which we operate and to comply with particular regulations. We believe licensing requirements, including protectionist policies which favor local firms over foreign firms, have generally been increasing in recent years. If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct regulated activities without a license or in contravention of applicable regulations, we may be required to pay fines, return commissions or investment capital from investors or may have a given license suspended or revoked. Our acquisition activity increases these risks, because we must successfully transfer licenses of acquired entities and their staff, as appropriate. Licensing requirements may also preclude us from engaging in certain types of transactions or change the way in which we conduct business or the cost of doing so. In addition, because the size and scope of real estate sales transactions, the number of countries in which we operate or invest, and the areas we offer services have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance, have increased.\nWith respect to our status as an approved lender for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and as a HUD-approved originator and issuer of Ginnie Mae securities (collectively the \u201cAgencies\u201d), we are required to comply with various eligibility criteria established by the Agencies, such as minimum net worth, operational liquidity and collateral requirements. In addition, we are required to originate and service loans in accordance with the applicable program requirements and guidelines established from time to time by the Agencies. Failure to comply with any of these program requirements may result in the termination or withdrawal of our approval to sell loans to the Agencies and service their loans.\nTo fund the Agency loans we originate, we require short-term funding capacity. As of December 31, 2020, we had $3.2 billion of committed loan funding available through commercial banks. Consistent with industry practice, our existing warehouse facilities are short-term, requiring annual renewal. Although we believe our current warehouse facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs in connection with our participation in the Agency programs, in the event any of our warehouse lines are terminated or are not renewed, we may be unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, and we might not be able to originate loans.\nThe regulatory environment facing the investment management industry has also grown significantly more complex in recent years. Countries are expanding the criteria requiring registration of investment advisors and funds, whether based in their country or not, and expanding the rules applicable to those that are registered, all to provide more protection to investors located within their countries. In some cases, rules from different countries are applicable to more than one of our investment advisory businesses and can conflict with those of their home countries. Although we believe we have good processes, policies and controls in place to address the new requirements, these additional registrations and increasingly complex rules increase the possibility violations may occur.\nThese risks also apply separately to the LaSalle-managed real estate investment trust we launched during 2012. That entity has registered the securities it is issuing with the SEC in the United States and is subject to regulation as a public company, albeit not one separately listed on a stock exchange.\nLaws and regulations applicable to our business, both in the United States and in other countries, may change in ways that materially increase the costs of compliance. Particularly in emerging markets, there can be relatively less transparency around the standards and conditions under which licenses are granted, maintained, or renewed. It also may be difficult to defend against the arbitrary revocation of a license in a jurisdiction where the rule of law is less well developed.\nAs a licensed real estate service provider and advisor in various jurisdictions, we and our licensed employees may be subject to various due diligence, disclosure, standard-of-care, anti-money laundering and other obligations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us to litigation from parties who purchased, sold, or leased properties we brokered or managed, or who invested in our funds. We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales or other services claiming we did not fulfill our obligations as a service provider or broker. This may include claims with respect to conflicts of interest where we are acting, or are perceived to be acting, for two or more clients with potentially contrary interests.\nENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND REGULATIONS; CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS; AND AIR QUALITY RISKS.\nOur operations are affected by federal, state and/or local environmental laws in the countries in which we operate, and we may face liability with respect to environmental issues occurring at properties we manage or occupy, or in which we invest. We may face costs or liabilities under these laws as a result of our role as an on-site property manager or a manager of construction projects. Our risks for such liabilities may increase as we expand our services to include more industrial and/or manufacturing facilities than has been the case in the past, or with respect to our co-investments in real estate as discussed above. Within our own operations, we face additional costs from rising energy costs which make it more expensive to power our corporate offices.\nThe impact of climate change presents a significant risk. Damage to assets caused by extreme weather events linked to climate change is becoming more evident, highlighting the fragility of global infrastructure. We also anticipate the potential effects of climate change will increasingly impact our own operations and those of client properties we manage, especially when they are in coastal cities.\nWe anticipate the potential effects of climate change will increasingly impact the decisions and analysis LaSalle makes with respect to the properties it considers for acquisition on behalf of clients, since climate change considerations can impact the relative desirability of locations and the cost of operating and insuring acquired properties. Future legislation that requires specific performance levels for building operations could make non-compliant buildings obsolete, which could materially affect investments in properties we have made on behalf of clients, including those in which we may have co-invested. Climate change considerations will likely also increasingly be part of the consulting work JLL does for clients to the extent it is relevant to the decisions our clients are seeking to make.\nAround the world, many countries are enacting stricter regulations to protect the environment and preserve their natural resources. Firms also may face several layers of national and regional regulations. In Europe, the EU\u2019s Environmental Liability Directive establishes a comprehensive liability standard, but individual EU countries may have stricter regulations. The risks may not be limited to fines and the costs of remediation. In Brazil, employees can risk jail sentences as well as fines in connection with pollution incidents. In September 2020, China announced a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2060. This follows environmental protection laws passed in 2014 designed to limit contaminated water, air and soil linked to economic growth and public health.\nDeclining air quality in major cities may have consequences for our business in various ways, including the need to respond to new regulations that affect the management of buildings, declines in the desire of investors or corporates to invest in or occupy properties in such cities, and our ability to retain staff in locations that may be relatively undesirable as places to live.\nFinancial Risk Factors\nFinancial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; credit risk; and liquidity risk, including risk related to our credit ratings and our availability and cost of funding.\nVOLATILITY IN TRANSACTIONAL-BASED REVENUE.\nLaSalle's portfolio is of sufficient size to periodically generate large incentive fees and equity gains (losses) that significantly influence our earnings and the changes in earnings from one year to the next. Volatility in this component of our earnings is inevitable due to the nature of this aspect of our business, and the amount of incentive fees or equity earnings or losses we may recognize in future quarters is inherently unpredictable as it relates to client needs, the market and other dynamics in effect at the time.\nWe have business lines other than LaSalle that also generate fees based on the timing, size and pricing of closed transactions, and these fees may significantly contribute to our earnings and to changes in earnings from one quarter or year to the next. Volatility in this component of our earnings is inevitable due to the nature of these businesses and the amount of the fees we will recognize in future quarters is inherently unpredictable.\nCURRENCY RESTRICTIONS AND EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS.\nWe produce positive cash flows in various countries and currencies that can be most effectively used to fund operations in other countries or to repay our indebtedness, which is currently primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and euros. We face restrictions in certain countries that limit or prevent the transfer of funds to other countries or the exchange of the local currency to other currencies. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may lead to a decline in the value of the funds earned in certain jurisdictions.\nAlthough we operate globally, we report our results in U.S. dollars, and thus our reported results are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of currencies against the U.S. dollar. As an example, the euro and the pound sterling, each a currency used in a significant portion of our operations, have fluctuated notably in recent years. Our revenue from outside of the United States approximated 43% our total revenue for 2020. In addition to the potential negative impact on reported earnings, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of the reported results of operations.\nWe are authorized to use currency-hedging instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts, purchased currency options and borrowings in foreign currency. There can be no assurance hedging will be economically effective. We do not use hedging instruments for speculative purposes.\nAs currency forward and option contracts are generally conducted off-exchange or over-the-counter (\"OTC\"), many of the safeguards accorded to participants on organized exchanges, such as the performance guarantee of an exchange clearing house, are generally unavailable in connection with OTC transactions. In addition, there can be no guarantee the counterparty will fulfill its obligations under the contractual agreement, especially in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty, which would effectively leave us unhedged.\nDOWNGRADES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS OR REDUCE OUR ACCESS TO FUNDING SOURCES IN THE CREDIT AND CAPITAL MARKETS.\nWe are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from Moody's and S&P based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness. As of the date of this filing, our debt ratings remain investment grade, but there can be no assurance we will not be downgraded or that any of our ratings will remain investment grade in the future. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest on certain of our senior notes. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nINCREASING FINANCIAL RISK OF COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING REFINANCING RISK.\nUnprecedented disruptions and dynamic changes in the financial markets, and particularly insofar as they have led to major changes in the status and creditworthiness of some of the world's largest banks, investment banks and insurance companies, among others, have generally increased the counterparty risk to us from a financial standpoint, including with respect to:\n\u2022Obtaining new credit commitments from lenders\n\u2022Refinancing credit commitments or loans that have terminated or matured according to their terms, including funds sponsored by our LaSalle which use leverage in the ordinary course of their investment activities\n\u2022Placing insurance\n\u2022Engaging in hedging transactions\n\u2022Maintaining cash deposits or other investments, both our own and those we hold for the benefit of clients, which are generally much larger than the maximum amount of government-sponsored deposit insurance in effect for a particular account\nGeneral Risk Factors\nABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY INTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nIf we are not able to continue to operate successfully under the requirements of Section 404 of the United States Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or if there is a failure of one or more controls over financial reporting due to fraud, improper execution or the failure of such controls to adjust adequately as our business evolves, then our reputation, financial results and the market price of our stock could suffer. We may be exposed to potential risks from this legislation, which requires companies to evaluate the effectiveness of their internal controls, and such internal control over financial reporting is subject to audit by their independent registered public accounting firm on an annual basis. We have evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as required for purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, there can be no assurance we will continue to receive an unqualified opinion in future years, particularly since standards continue to evolve and are not necessarily being applied consistently from one independent registered public accounting firm to another. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future that we cannot remediate in a timely fashion, we may be unable to receive an unqualified opinion at some time in the future from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nPOTENTIALLY ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES; CHANGES IN TAX LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND TAX RATES.\nWe face a variety of risks of increased future taxation on our earnings as a corporate taxpayer in the countries in which we have operations. Moving funds between countries can produce adverse tax consequences. In addition, as our operations are global, we face challenges in effectively gaining a tax benefit for costs incurred in one country that benefit our operations in other countries.\nChanges in tax legislation or tax rates may occur in one or more jurisdictions in which we operate that may materially impact the cost of operating our business. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"). The Act included new limitations on business-related deductions and could increase the taxation of foreign earnings in the U.S., which could increase our future tax expense. Further changes to U.S. corporate tax law have been proposed in the past year, some of which could further increase our future tax expense if enacted.\nIn addition, the potential exists for significant legislative policy change in the taxation of multinational corporations, as has recently been the subject of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Union Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, and legislation inspired or required by those initiatives. It is also possible that some governments will make significant changes to their tax policies in response to factors such as budgetary needs, feedback from the business community and the public view on applicable tax planning activities. Further, interpretations of existing tax law in various countries may change due to the regulatory and examination policies of the tax authorities and the decisions of courts.\nWe face such risks both in our own business and in the investment funds LaSalle operates. Adverse or unanticipated tax consequences to the funds can negatively impact fund performance, incentive fees and the value of co-investments we have made. We are uncertain as to the ultimate results of these potential changes or what their effects will be on our business.", "PERMNO": 85246, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "JLL"}
