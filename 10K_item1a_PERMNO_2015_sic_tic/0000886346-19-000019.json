{"cik": "886346", "company": "KADANT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition, and an investment in our securities, are subject to a number of risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic and industry conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material also may impair our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in global and local economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nWe sell products worldwide to global process industries and a significant portion of our revenue is from customers based in North America, Europe and China. Uncertainties in global and regional economic outlooks have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, demand for our customers' products and, as a consequence, our products and services, especially our capital equipment systems and products, and our operating results. Also, uncertainty regarding economic conditions has caused, and may in the future cause, liquidity and credit issues for many businesses, including our customers in the pulp and paper industry as well as other process industries, and may result in their inability to fund projects, capacity expansion plans, and to some extent, routine operations and capital expenditures. These conditions have resulted, and may in the future result, in a number of structural changes in process industries, including decreased spending, mill closures, consolidations, and bankruptcies, all of which negatively affect our business, revenue, and profitability. Financial and economic turmoil affecting the worldwide economy or the banking system and financial markets, in particular due to political or economic developments, could cause the expectations for our business to differ materially in the future.\nKadant Inc.\nRevenues from the sale of large capital equipment and systems projects are often difficult to predict accurately, especially in periods of economic uncertainty, and large capital equipment projects require significant investment requiring our customers to secure financing, which may be difficult.\nWe manufacture capital equipment and systems used in process industries, including the wood processing and paper industries. Approximately 41% of our revenue in 2018 was from the sale of capital equipment to be used in process industries. Our acquisition of SMH further expands our capacity to manufacture and sell capital equipment. The demand for capital equipment is variable and depends on a number of factors, including consumer demand for end products, existing manufacturing capacity, the level of capital spending by our customers and economic conditions. As a consequence, our bookings and revenues for capital projects tend to be variable and difficult to predict. It is especially difficult to accurately forecast our operating results during periods of economic uncertainty. Our customers curtail their capital and operating spending during periods of economic uncertainty and are cautious about resuming spending as market conditions improve. Levels of consumer spending on non-durable goods, demand for food and beverage packaging, and demand for new housing and remodeling are all factors that affect paper and wood processing companies' demand for our products, and reductions in these demand levels can negatively impact our business. As companies in our customers' industries consolidate operations in response to market weakness, they frequently reduce capacity, increase downtime, defer maintenance and upgrades, and postpone or even cancel capacity additions or expansion projects. Capacity growth and investment can be uneven and the larger paper producers have delayed, and may in the future delay, additional new capacity start-ups in reaction to softer market conditions. In general, as significant capacity additions come online and the economic growth rate slows, paper producers have deferred and could in the future defer further investments or the delivery of previously-ordered equipment until the market absorbs the new production.\nLarge capital equipment projects require a significant investment and may require our customers to secure financing from external sources. Our financial performance will be negatively impacted if there are delays in customers securing financing or our customers become unable to secure such financing due to any number of factors, including a tightening of monetary policy or regime-based sanctions such as those imposed on Russia, and more recently, on China. Financing delays of our customers can cause us to delay booking pending orders as well as the shipment of some orders. The inability of our customers to obtain credit may affect our ability to recognize revenue and income, particularly on large capital equipment orders from new customers for which we may require letters of credit. We may also be unable to issue letters of credit to our customers, which are required in some cases to guarantee performance, during periods of economic uncertainty. This has negatively affected our bookings and revenues in the past, particularly in China, and may negatively affect our operating results in the future.\nOur global operations subject us to various risks that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are a leading global supplier of equipment and critical components used in process industries worldwide. We sell our products globally, including sales to customers in China, South America, Russia and India, and operate multiple manufacturing operations worldwide, including operations in Canada, China, Europe, Mexico, and Brazil. International revenues and operations are subject to a number of risks which vary by geographic region, including the following:\n-\nagreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country's legal system;\n-\nforeign customers may have longer payment cycles;\n-\nforeign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose tariffs, adopt other restrictions on foreign trade, impose currency restrictions or enact other protectionist or anti-trade measures;\n-\nenvironmental and other regulations can adversely impact our ability to operate our facilities;\n-\ndisruption from climate change, natural disaster, including earthquakes and/or tornadoes, fires, war, terrorist activity, and other force majeure events beyond our control;\n-\nworsening economic conditions may result in worker unrest, labor actions, and potential work stoppages;\n-\npolitical unrest may disrupt commercial activities of ours or our customers;\n-\nit may be difficult to repatriate funds, due to unfavorable domestic and foreign tax consequences or other restrictions or limitations imposed by foreign governments; and\n-\nthe protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce.\nOperating globally subjects us to changes in government regulations and policies in multiple jurisdictions around the world, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls and political risks. Changes in government policies, political unrest, economic sanctions, trade embargoes, or other adverse trade regulations can negatively impact our business. For example, we operate businesses in Mexico and Canada, and we benefit from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which is proposed to be revised by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). If the\nKadant Inc.\nUnited States were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or the successor USMCA or to impose significant tariffs or taxes on goods imported into the United States, the cost of our products could significantly increase or no longer be priced competitively, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The USMCA does not contain an agreement on certain existing tariffs. The United States, Canada, and Mexico must each still ratify the USMCA in their respective legal systems before it becomes effective. In the United States, Congress will be required to pass implementing legislation, the timing of which is uncertain. In addition, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, or USTR, released a list of Chinese products valued at approximately $50 billion, including pulp and paper machinery equipment, that is subject to an additional 25% duty in accordance with President Trump\u2019s Presidential Memorandum of March 22, 2018 directing action pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection began to collect the additional duties on products covered by the tariffs on July 6, 2018. In addition, the USTR issued a new list of an additional $200 billion in Chinese products that will be subject to an additional 10% duty, which the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began to collect on September 24, 2018, and which increased to 25% on January 1, 2019. While we are working to assess and mitigate the impact of the existing and other proposed tariffs through pricing and sourcing strategies, we cannot be certain how our customers and competitors will react to the actions we take. The tariffs could negatively affect our ability to compete against competitors who do not manufacture in China and/or are not subject to the tariffs.\nIn 2018, our sales to Russia were $17.7 million, or 3%, of our revenue. In August 2017 and April 2018, the United States imposed new trade sanctions against certain persons in Russia, in addition to those previously imposed in 2014. In response, Russia may impose trade sanctions that could affect U.S.-owned businesses. The imposition of trade sanctions may make it generally more difficult to do business in Russia and cause delays or prevent shipment of products or services performed by our personnel, or to receive payment for products or services. Such restrictions could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results going forward.\nWe operate significant manufacturing facilities in and derive significant revenue from China. Changes in the policies of the Chinese government, devaluation of the Chinese currency, restrictions on the expatriation of cash, political unrest, unstable economic conditions, or other developments in China or in U.S.-China relations that are adverse to trade, including enactment of protectionist legislation or trade or currency restrictions, could negatively impact our business and operating results. Policies of the Chinese government to target slower economic growth may negatively affect our business in China if customers are unable to expand capacity or obtain financing for expansion or improvement projects. Policies of the Chinese government to advance internal political priorities may potentially negatively affect our business in any number of ways that we may not foresee. For example, China has imposed a ban on mixed waste paper imports and reported that all recovered paper imports have been and are limited to a 0.5% contaminant level after March 1, 2018, which is well below the level that suppliers consider feasible. In addition, the Chinese government has announced that it may ban all recovered paper imports by 2020. According to Fastmarkets RISI, the Chinese government's actions have led to a severe shortage of recovered paper in China, which has forced mills to incur additional downtime. Chinese containerboard producers have been looking to build capacity for fiber in Southeast Asia, with the intent to ship pulp back to China for further processing. These policies could have a significant influence on the price, nature and availability of the type of paper imported into China, could have a negative effect on the operating capacity of our customers in China, and may affect the demand for our products and our operating results in the future, both in China and in the surrounding region.\nOur sales of capital equipment in China tend to be more variable and are subject to a number of uncertainties.\nOur bookings and revenues from China have tended to be more variable than in other geographic regions. The Chinese pulp and paper industry has experienced periods of significant capacity expansion to meet demand followed by periods of reduced activity while overcapacity is absorbed. These cycles result in periods of significant bookings activity for our capital products and increased revenues followed by a significant decrease in bookings or potential delays in shipments and order placements by our customers as they attempt to balance supply and demand.\nOrders from customers in China, particularly for large stock-preparation systems that have been tailored to a customer's specific requirements, have credit risks higher than we generally incur elsewhere, and some orders are subject to the receipt of financing approvals from the Chinese government or can be impacted by the availability of credit and more restrictive monetary policies. We generally do not record bookings for signed contracts from customers in China for large stock-preparation systems until we receive the down payments for such contracts. The timing of the receipt of these orders and the down payments are uncertain and there is no assurance that we will be able to recognize revenue on these contracts. We may experience a loss if a contract is canceled prior to the receipt of a down payment if we have commenced engineering or other work associated with the contract. We typically have inventory awaiting shipment to customers and could incur a loss if contracts are canceled and we cannot re-sell the equipment. In addition, we may experience a loss if the contract is canceled, or the customer does not fulfill its obligations under the contract, prior to the receipt of a letter of credit or final payments covering the remaining balance of the contract, which could represent 80% or more of the total order. As a result of these factors, our revenues recognized in China have varied, and will in the future vary, greatly from period to period and be difficult to predict.\nKadant Inc.\nIn addition, please also see \u201cRisk Factors - Our global operations subject us to various risks that may adversely affect our results of operations\u201d for discussion of how policies of the Chinese government may potentially negatively affect our business in any number of ways, including some of which we may not foresee.\nWe manufacture equipment used in the production of forest products, including lumber and OSB, and our financial performance may be adversely affected by decreased levels of residential construction activity.\nWe manufacture debarkers, stranders and related equipment used in the production of lumber and OSB, an engineered wood panel product used primarily in home construction. Our customers produce these products principally for new residential construction, home repair and remodeling activities. As such, the operating results for our Wood Processing Systems segment correlate to a significant degree to the level of this residential construction activity, primarily in North America and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. Residential construction activity is influenced by a number of factors, including the supply of and demand for new and existing homes, new housing starts, unemployment rates, interest rate levels, availability of mortgage financing, mortgage foreclosure rates, availability of construction labor and suitable land, seasonal and unusual weather conditions, general economic conditions and consumer confidence. A significant increase in long-term interest rates, changes in tax policy of the deductibility of mortgages, tightened lending standards, high unemployment rates and other factors that reduce the level of residential construction activity could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe OSB market is highly concentrated and the market for building products is highly competitive. The loss of a significant customer or our customers' reductions in capital spending or OSB production could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe OSB market is highly concentrated and there are a limited number of OSB manufacturers. As a percentage of our Wood Processing Systems segment revenues, the two largest OSB customers accounted for 14% in 2018, 29% in 2017, and 48% in 2016. The loss of one or more of these OSB customers to a competitor could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, the market for building products is highly competitive. Products that compete with OSB include other wood panel products and substitutes for wood building products, such as nonfiber-based alternatives. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to OSB products. Changes in component prices, such as energy, chemicals, wood-based fibers, and nonfiber alternatives can change the competitive position of OSB relative to other available alternatives and could increase substitution. Our customers' OSB production can be adversely affected by lower-cost producers of other wood panel products and substitutes for wood building products. Lower demand for OSB products or a decline in the profitability of one or more of our customers could result in a reduction in spending on capital equipment or the shutdown or closure of an OSB mill, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe development and increasing use of digital media has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our Papermaking Systems segment.\nDevelopments in digital media have adversely affected demand for newsprint and for printing and writing grades of paper, particularly in North America and Europe, a trend which is expected to continue. Approximately 11% of our revenue in 2018 was from customers producing newsprint and printing and writing grades of paper. Significant declines in the production of printing and writing paper grades have also led to a drop in the construction of recycled tissue mills, as those mills use printing and writing grades of waste paper as their fiber source. The increased use of digital media has had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on demand for our products in those markets.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that impact our business in many ways. We are exposed to both translation as well as transaction risk associated with transactions denominated in currencies that differ from our subsidiaries' functional currencies. Although most of our subsidiaries' costs are denominated in the same currency as their revenues, changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and can adversely affect our operating results. Some of the foreign currency translation risk is mitigated when foreign subsidiaries have revenue and expenses in the same foreign currency. Further, certain foreign subsidiaries may hold U.S. dollar assets or liabilities which, as the U.S. dollar strengthens versus the applicable functional currencies, will result in currency transaction gains on assets or losses on liabilities. While some foreign currency transaction risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments, or may be insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and may not always be successful.\nWhen we translate the local currency results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars during a period in which the U.S. dollar is strengthening, our financial results will reflect decreases due to foreign currency translation. In addition, our consolidated financial results are adversely affected when foreign governments devalue their currencies. Our major foreign currency translation exposures involve the currencies in Europe, China, Brazil, Canada and Mexico. For example, China's central bank devalued the renminbi to boost the Chinese economy in 2016, which had a negative translation impact on our consolidated revenues and will continue to have a negative translation impact if this recurs. The overall favorable or\nKadant Inc.\nunfavorable effect of foreign currency translation on our financial results will vary by quarter. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge this type of foreign currency translation risk.\nThe business of our subsidiary, SMH, can be materially impacted by cyclical economic conditions affecting the global mining industry.\nChanges in economic conditions affecting the global mining industry can occur abruptly and unpredictably, which may have significant effects on the sales of original equipment by our new subsidiary, SMH. Cyclicality for original equipment sales is driven primarily by price volatility of the commodities that are mined using SMH\u2019s equipment, including coal, salt, aggregates, potash, copper, iron ore and trona, or their substitutes, as well as product life cycles, competitive pressures and other economic factors affecting the mining industry, such as company consolidation, increased regulation and competition affecting demand for commodities, as well as the broader economy, including changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and from market expectations with respect to such policies. Falling commodity prices have in the past and may in the future lead to reduced capital expenditures by SMH\u2019s customers, reductions in the production levels of existing mines, a contraction in the number of existing mines and the closure of less efficient mines. Reduced capital expenditures and decreased mining activity by SMH\u2019s customers are likely to lead to a decrease in demand for new mining equipment, and may result in a decrease in demand for parts as SMH\u2019s customers are likely to reduce utilization of equipment, reduce inventories, redistribute parts from closed mines and delay rebuilds and other maintenance during industry downturns. In addition to declining orders for SMH\u2019s products, adverse economic conditions for SMH\u2019s customers may make it more difficult for SMH to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner, or at all, which may adversely affect Kadant\u2019s working capital. As a result of this cyclicality in the global mining industry, SMH may experience significant fluctuations in its business, results of operations and financial condition, and we expect SMH\u2019s business to continue to be subject to these fluctuations in the future.\nA sizable portion of SMH\u2019s business is dependent on continued demand for coal, which is subject to economic and environmental risks.\nApproximately 19% and 10% of SMH's 2018 revenues came from its thermal and metallurgical coal-mining customers, respectively. Many of these customers supply coal for the generation of electricity and/or steel production. Demand for electricity and steel is affected by the global level of economic activity and economic growth. The pursuit of the most cost-effective form of electricity generation continues to take place throughout the world and coal-fired electricity generation faces intense price competition from other fuel sources, particularly natural gas. In addition, coal combustion typically generates significant greenhouse gas emissions and governmental and private sector goals and mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may increasingly affect the mix of electricity generation sources. Further developments in connection with legislation, regulations, international agreements or other limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts or costs from coal combustion, both in the United States and in other countries, could diminish demand for coal as a fuel for electricity generation. If lower greenhouse gas emitting forms of electricity generation, such as nuclear, solar, natural gas or wind power, become more prevalent or cost effective, or diminished economic activity reduces demand for electricity and steel, demand for coal will decline. Reduced demand for coal could result in reduced demand for SMH\u2019s mining equipment and could adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrice increases and shortages in raw materials and components and dependency upon certain suppliers for such raw materials and components could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe use a variety of raw materials, including a significant amount of stainless steel, carbon steel, commodities and critical components to manufacture our products. Increases in the prices of such raw materials, commodities and critical components could adversely affect our operating results if we were unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements, or cost reduction programs.\nSome of our businesses depend on limited suppliers to provide critical components used in the manufacture of our products. If we could not obtain sufficient supplies of these components or these sources of supply ceased to be available to us, we could experience shortages in critical components or be unable to meet our commitments to customers. Alternative sources of supply could be more expensive or, in some cases, not available. We believe our sources of raw materials, commodities and critical components will generally be sufficient for our needs in the foreseeable future. However, our operating results could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations.\nImplementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe expect that a significant driver of our growth over the next several years will be the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services or may involve entry into a new process industry, such as our January 2019 acquisition of SMH. We continue to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance, and involve significant cash expenditures and the incurrence\nKadant Inc.\nof significant debt. Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons, including:\n-\ndifficulties identifying and executing acquisitions;\n-\ncompetition with other prospective buyers resulting in our inability to complete an acquisition or in our paying a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business;\n-\naccess to and availability of capital;\n-\ninability to obtain regulatory approvals, including antitrust approvals;\n-\ndifficulty in integrating operations, technologies, products and the key employees of the acquired business;\n-\ninability to maintain existing customers of the acquired business or to sell the products and services of the acquired business to our existing customers;\n-\ninability to retain key management of the acquired business;\n-\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n-\ninability to improve the revenues and profitability or realize the cost savings and synergies expected of the acquisition;\n-\nassumption of significant liabilities, some of which may be unknown at the time of acquisition;\n-\npotential future impairment of the value of goodwill and intangible assets acquired; and\n-\nidentification of internal control deficiencies of the acquired business.\nWe are required to record transaction and acquisition-related costs in the period incurred. Once completed, acquisitions may involve significant integration costs. These acquisition-related costs could be significant in a reporting period and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAny acquisition we complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business. We are required to assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill and intangible assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or assets, and our ability to realize the value of goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. We may incur impairment charges to write down the value of our goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the future if the assets are not deemed recoverable, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nFailure of our information systems or breaches of data security and cybertheft could impact our business.\nWe operate a geographically dispersed business and rely on the electronic storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information, including technical and financial information, among our operations, customers and suppliers. In addition, for some of our operations, we rely on information systems controlled by third parties. Despite our security measures and internal controls, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or cyberthieves or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, such as business email compromises and other cyber-related fraud. As part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing enterprise resource planning software to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. System failures, network disruptions, and breaches of data security could limit our ability to conduct business as usual, including our ability to communicate and transact business with our customers and suppliers; result in the loss or misuse of this information, including credit card numbers or other personal information, the loss of business or customers, or damage to our brand or reputation; or interrupt or delay reporting of our financial results. Such system failures or unauthorized access could be caused by external theft or attack, misconduct by our employees, suppliers, or competitors, or natural disasters. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures, such as to comply with local privacy laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, could be significant.\nWe are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.\nWe are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, particularly those relating to environmental protection, the importation and exportation of products, tariffs and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls, current good manufacturing practices, data protection, health and safety and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad, such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws, and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nKadant Inc.\nIt may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.\nSome of the markets in which we compete are mature and have relatively low growth rates. We pursue a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:\n-\nstrengthening our presence in selected geographic markets, including emerging markets and existing markets where we see opportunities;\n-\nfocusing on parts and consumables sales;\n-\nusing low-cost manufacturing bases, such as China and Mexico;\n-\nallocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;\n-\ndeveloping new applications for our technologies;\n-\ncombining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively;\n-\nfinding new markets for our products and expanding into different verticals or process industries; and\n-\ncontinuing to develop cross-selling opportunities for our products and services to take advantage of our depth of product offerings.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.\nWe are subject to intense competition in all our markets.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products include technical expertise and process knowledge, product innovation, product quality, and price. Our competitors include a number of large multinational corporations that may have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies, such as smart technology, and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their services and products. Competitors' technologies may prove to be superior to ours. Our current products, those under development, and our ability to develop new technologies may not be sufficient to enable us to compete effectively. Competition, especially in China, has increased as new companies enter the market and existing competitors expand their product lines and manufacturing operations.\nAdverse changes to the soundness of our suppliers and customers could affect our business and results of operations.\nAll our businesses are exposed to risk associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers and customers, including pulp and paper manufacturers, forest products and other industrial customers, many of which may be adversely affected by volatile conditions in the financial markets, worldwide economic downturns, variability in infrastructure spending levels, and difficult economic conditions. These conditions could result in financial instability, bankruptcy, or other adverse effects at any of our suppliers or customers. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our suppliers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products or pay amounts due, and bankruptcy of customers or other creditors. Any adverse changes to the soundness of our suppliers or customers may adversely affect our cash flows, profitability, or financial condition.\nChanges in our tax provision or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue and earnings from our international operations, and are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in U.S. and foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. A number of factors may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate, including: changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions; unanticipated changes in the amount of profit in jurisdictions in which the statutory tax rates may be higher or lower than the U.S. tax rate; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits or our ability to utilize foreign tax credits; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from that of prior periods or current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act) was enacted in the U.S. that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code. The 2017 Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% starting in 2018 and transitioned from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system imposing a one-time tax on all foreign unremitted earnings at reduced rates. The 2017 Tax Act introduced many new provisions that become effective in 2018, including but not limited to, Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), Foreign Derived Intangible\nKadant Inc.\nIncome (FDII) deduction, limitation of the tax deduction for net interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income, immediate deductions for certain new fixed asset additions instead of depreciating assets over time and changed deductions for executive compensation. The impact of the 2017 Tax Act remains subject to developing interpretations of the relevant provisions in the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, as well as the conformity and application of these regulations in various states. We continue to assess the impact of the new provisions on the tax provision already included in our financial statements and guidance and we may need to make adjustments as the application of the law becomes clearer, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage our manufacturing operations, our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nEquipment and operating systems necessary for our manufacturing businesses may break down, perform poorly, or fail. Any such disruption could cause losses in efficiencies, delays in shipments of our products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us for our losses.\nIn order to enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our manufacturing operations, and to better serve customers located in various countries, as we have in the past, we may in the future move several product lines from one of our plants to another and consolidate manufacturing operations in certain of our plants. Even if we successfully move our manufacturing processes, there is no assurance that the cost savings and efficiencies we anticipate will be achieved.\nChanges in zoning laws in China may require us to relocate certain of our manufacturing facilities. For example, we received a request by local Chinese authorities to relocate one of our facilities, and have begun negotiating with the Chinese government regarding the relocation of such facility. A relocation may increase our costs and could have a material impact on our manufacturing operations.\nIn addition, our manufacture of certain products is concentrated in specific geographic locations. As a result of such concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of any disruptions (including natural disasters), regulations or delays that impact those geographic locations, which may negatively impact our ability to manufacture products produced in those locations and have an adverse effect on our business results.\nWe may be required to reorganize our operations in response to changing conditions in the worldwide economy and the industries we serve, and such actions may require significant expenditures and may not be successful.\nWe have undertaken various restructuring measures in the past in response to changing market conditions in the countries in which we operate and we may engage in additional cost reduction programs in the future. The costs of these programs may be significant and we may not recoup the costs of these programs. In connection with any future plant closures, delays or failures in the transition of production from existing facilities to our other facilities in other geographic regions could also adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, it is difficult to accurately forecast our financial performance in periods of economic uncertainty in a region or globally, and the efforts we have made or may make to align our cost structure may not be sufficient or able to keep pace with rapidly changing business conditions. Our profitability may decline if our restructuring efforts do not sufficiently reduce our future costs and position us to maintain or increase our sales.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.\nThe approval in June 2016 by voters in the United Kingdom (U.K.) to exit from the European Union (E.U.), referred to as Brexit, and the continuing negotiations relating to Brexit in 2019, has caused, and may from time to time cause:\n-\nvolatility in the global stock markets;\n-\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n-\neffects on cross border trade and labor; and\n-\npolitical and regulatory uncertainty in the U.K. and across Europe generally.\nThe global economic uncertainty that may occur at various periods throughout the lengthy withdrawal process may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets. All of these events, should they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. Our revenues to customers in the U.K. represented approximately 3% of total revenues in 2018.\nKadant Inc.\nOur debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities.\nWe have borrowed amounts under our five-year, unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) and under other agreements to fund our operations and our acquisition strategy. As a result of the acquisitions of our forest products business in 2017 and the SMH acquisition completed in January 2019, we increased our U.S. and foreign-denominated borrowings under the Credit Agreement. While we increased our borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement in December 2018 in connection with the SMH acquisition, our remaining borrowing capacity is limited. Our borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement may further decrease as a result of the impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations could have on our foreign-denominated borrowings.\nIn 2018, under the Credit Agreement, we increased our borrowing capacity from $300.0 million to $400.0 million and increased our uncommitted unsecured incremental borrowing facility from $100.0 million to $150.0 million. In addition, we borrowed $21.0 million, pursuant to a promissory note secured by real estate and related personal property of certain of our domestic subsidiaries (Real Estate Loan). In 2018, we also issued $10.0 million in senior notes under our Multi-Currency Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with PGIM, Inc., an affiliate of Prudential (Note Purchase Agreement). We may also in the future obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our indebtedness could have negative consequences, including:\n-\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n-\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n-\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends on or to repurchase our capital stock;\n-\nlimiting our ability to complete a merger or an acquisition or acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing agreements; and\n-\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete.\nOur existing indebtedness bears interest at fixed and floating rates, and as a result, our interest payment obligations on our indebtedness will fluctuate if interest rates increase or decrease. From time to time, we hedge a portion of our variable rate interest payment obligations through interest rate swap agreements. The counterparty to the swap agreements could demand an early termination of the swap agreements if we were to be in default under the Credit Agreement, or any agreement that amends or replaces the Credit Agreement in which the counterparty is a member, and we were unable to cure the default. If our swap agreements were to be terminated prior to the applicable scheduled maturity date and if we were required to pay cash for the value of the swap, we could incur a loss, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, the 2017 Tax Act places certain limitations on the deductibility of interest expense as a percentage of adjusted taxable income. If interest rates or the level of our debt increase, to the extent that the associated interest expense exceeds the limitation established by the 2017 Tax Act, the amount of interest expense that we would not be able to deduct for income tax purposes, if significant, could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy. If we were unable to service our debt and fund our business, we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or research and development expenditures, seek additional financing or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt, curtail or eliminate our cash dividend to stockholders, or sell assets.\nRestrictions in our Credit Agreement and Note Purchase Agreement may limit our activities.\nOur Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement contain, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us, including restrictions on our ability (including the ability of our subsidiaries) to:\n-\nincur additional indebtedness;\n-\npay dividends on, redeem, or repurchase our capital stock;\n-\nmake investments;\n-\ncreate liens;\n-\nsell assets;\n-\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n-\nconsolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries.\nWe are also required to meet specified financial covenants under the terms of our Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future\nKadant Inc.\nperformance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as currency exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology, and changes in the level of competition. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under our Credit Agreement, the Note Purchase Agreement, our swap agreements with notional amounts of $10.0 million and $15.0 million, entered into in 2015 and 2018, respectively, and other loan and note obligations, which could permit acceleration of the debt under those instruments and require us to repay the debt before its scheduled due date. If an event of default were to occur, we might not have sufficient funds available to make the payments required under our indebtedness. In addition, our inability to borrow funds under our Credit Agreement would have significant consequences for our business, including reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; and impacting our ability to pay dividends and meet other financial obligations.\nFurthermore, our Credit Agreement requires that any amounts borrowed under the facility be repaid by the maturity date in 2023. If we are unable to roll over the amounts borrowed into a new credit facility and we do not have sufficient cash to repay our borrowings, we may default under the Credit Agreement. We may need to repatriate cash from our overseas operations, which may not be possible, to fund the repayment and we would be required to pay taxes on the repatriated amounts. Such repatriation would have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees and effective succession planning.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of the services or retirement of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. We also may be unable to attract qualified personnel or retain existing management, product development, sales, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise, or know-how, and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. In addition, effective succession planning is also a key factor for our future success. On February 13, 2019 our board of directors adopted the Succession Plan, pursuant to which Jeffrey L. Powell was appointed to succeed Jonathan W. Painter as president effective April 1, 2019 and as chief executive officer effective July 1, 2019. Mr. Painter, our current president and chief executive officer, will become executive chairman of the board of directors effective July 1, 2019. Our failure to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions with regard to key management employees, including in connection with the Succession Plan, could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. If we fail to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions for key personnel, the operating results and future growth for our business could be adversely affected, and the morale and productivity of the workforce could be disrupted.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property or defend ourselves against the intellectual property claims of others could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, litigation to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights or defend ourselves could result in significant litigation or licensing expense.\nWe seek patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology, copy our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market share. In addition, as our patents expire, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our products. We cannot be sure the steps we have taken, or will take in the future, will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information and intellectual property. Of particular concern are developing countries, such as China, where the laws, courts, and administrative agencies may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States or Europe.\nWe seek to protect trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, through confidentiality and non-competition agreements with our collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements may be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors, or our competitors may otherwise gain access to our intellectual property.\nWe could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us, including for alleged infringement of third-party rights, or in suits in which we may assert our intellectual property or contractual rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur newly-acquired subsidiary, SMH, holds several U.S. and foreign patents, including foreign counterparts to its U.S. patents, and licenses the trademarked brand name of one of its significant products, Link-Belt\u00ae, from a third party. If the third-\nKadant Inc.\nparty were to terminate that license agreement, we would lose the right to use the Link-Belt\u00ae trademark in the marketplace and cease to benefit from any of its associated goodwill.\nOur share price fluctuates and experiences price and volume volatility.\nStock markets in general and our common stock in particular experience significant price and volume volatility from time to time. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects, or future funding. Given the nature of the markets in which we participate and the volatility of orders, we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability, and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations. A large proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant selling, research and development, and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect our operating results. Other factors that could affect our share price and quarterly operating results include:\n-\nchanges in the assumptions used for revenue recognized over time;\n-\nfluctuations in revenues due to customer-initiated delays in product shipments;\n-\nfailure of a customer to comply with an order's contractual obligations or inability of a customer to provide financial assurances of performance;\n-\nadverse changes in demand for and market acceptance of our products;\n-\nfailure of our products to pass contractually agreed upon acceptance tests, which could delay or prohibit recognition of revenues under applicable accounting guidelines;\n-\ncompetitive pressures resulting in lower sales prices for our products;\n-\nadverse changes in the process industries we serve;\n-\ndelays or problems in our introduction of new products;\n-\ndelays or problems in the manufacture of our products;\n-\nour competitors' announcements of new products, services, or technological innovations;\n-\ncontractual liabilities incurred by us related to guarantees of our product performance;\n-\nincreased costs of raw materials or supplies, including the cost of energy;\n-\nchanges in the timing of product orders;\n-\nchanges in the estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenses;\n-\nthe impact of acquisition accounting, including the treatment of acquisition and restructuring costs as period costs;\n-\nfluctuations in our outstanding indebtedness and associated interest expense;\n-\nfluctuations in our effective tax rate;\n-\nthe operating and share price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us; and\n-\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions.\nAdverse changes to the soundness of financial institutions could affect us.\nWe have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities and insurance underwriters, and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, such as our interest rate swap arrangements and other hedging transactions. In addition, our subsidiaries in China often hold banker's acceptance drafts that are received from customers in the normal course of business. These drafts may be discounted or used to pay vendors prior to the scheduled maturity date or submitted to an acceptance bank for payment at the scheduled maturity date. These financial institutions or counterparties could be adversely affected by volatile conditions in the financial markets, economic downturns, and difficult economic conditions. These conditions could result in financial instability, bankruptcy, or other adverse effects at these financial institutions or counterparties. We may not be able to access credit facilities in the future, complete transactions as intended, or otherwise obtain the benefit of the arrangements we have entered into with such financial parties, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nKadant Inc.\nWe are subject to risks and costs associated with environmental laws and regulations.\nThe manufacturing of our products requires the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental health and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or regulatory penalties, fines and legal liability. Our ability to expand, modify or operate our manufacturing facilities in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements. The Chinese government has pledged to tackle the country's hazardous smog, and authorities try to clear the skies ahead of high profile events, which prompt authorities to impose strict pollution control measures. Regulators have in the past and may in the future temporarily restrict our manufacturing in a particular geographic location as a result of pollution levels in China. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. These risks could harm our business and results of operations.\nClimate change may adversely impact our business.\nClimate change may pose environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. Many of our operations are located in regions that may become increasingly vulnerable due to climate change, which may cause extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, winds, and rainfall, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions or weather-driven natural disasters could impact our ability to maintain our operations in those areas and could affect demand for our products by our customers that are affected by weather and weather-driven events, including seasonal changes in outdoor working conditions and rainfall levels. These risks could harm our business and results of operations.\nEnvironmental, health and mine safety laws and regulations impacting the mining industry may adversely affect demand for products manufactured by our subsidiary, SMH.\nOur new subsidiary, SMH, supplies equipment to mining companies operating in major mining regions throughout the world. SMH\u2019s customers\u2019 operations are subject to or affected by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate, including those directly impacting mining activities and those indirectly affecting their businesses, such as applicable environmental and mine safety laws. New environmental and health legislation or administrative regulations relating to mining or affecting demand for mined materials or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require SMH\u2019s customers to significantly change or curtail their operations. The mining industry has also encountered increased scrutiny as it relates to safety regulations, primarily due to high-profile mining accidents. New legislation or regulations relating to mine safety standards may induce customers to discontinue or limit their mining operations and may discourage companies from developing new mines or maintaining existing mines, which in turn could diminish demand for our products and services.\nThe high cost of compliance with such regulations and standards may discourage SMH\u2019s customers from expanding existing mines or developing new mines and may also cause customers to limit or even discontinue their mining operations. As a result of these factors, demand for SMH\u2019s mining equipment could be adversely affected by environmental and health regulations directly or indirectly impacting the mining industry. Any reduction in demand for SMH\u2019s products as a result of environmental, health or mine safety regulations could have an adverse effect on SMH\u2019s overall business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate or expensive.\nWe are subject to claims in the ordinary course of business. It is not always possible to prevent or detect activities giving rise to claims, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. We may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, certain risks generally are not fully insurable. Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest their obligations to make payments. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from uninsured or under-insured events, as well as by delays in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments.\nKadant Inc.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor.\nProvisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that our shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. For example, these provisions:\n-\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock without any need for action by shareholders;\n-\nprovide for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n-\nrequire supermajority shareholder voting to effect various amendments to our charter and bylaws;\n-\neliminate the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders;\n-\nprohibit shareholder action by written consent; and\n-\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nOur board of directors could adopt a shareholder rights plan in the future that could have anti-takeover effects and might discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that our board of directors does not believe is in our best interests and those of our shareholders, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.\nWe have not independently verified the results of third-party research or confirmed assumptions or judgments on which they may be based, and the forecasted and other forward-looking information contained therein is subject to inherent uncertainties.\nWe refer in this report and other documents that we file with the SEC to historical, forecasted and other forward-looking information published by sources such as Fastmarkets RISI, Forest Economic Advisors, the U.S. Census Bureau, and various market news agencies that we believe to be reliable. However, we have not independently verified this information, and with respect to the forecasted and forward-looking information, have not independently confirmed the assumptions and judgments upon which such information is based.
