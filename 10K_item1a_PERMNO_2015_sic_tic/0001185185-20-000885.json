{"cik": "1316644", "company": "AeroGrow International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-06-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, future performance and forward-looking statements are affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions in the United States, Canada and worldwide, competition, interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other events. The following items are representative of the risks, uncertainties and other conditions that may impact our business.\nRisks Related to the Market for our Securities\nScotts Miracle-Gro owns more than 80% of AeroGrow\u2019s common stock and has effective control over the Board of Directors and all matters affecting the Company.\nAs disclosed above, Scotts Miracle-Gro currently owns more than 80% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock and has effective control of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors is comprised of three members who are affiliated with Scotts Miracle-Gro and two members who are not affiliated with Scotts Miracle-Gro (the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d). As a result, Scotts Miracle-Gro has effective control over all matters affecting the Company, including the power to approve or reject significant corporate matters, such as mergers, acquisitions, dividends, loans, security issuances and all matters that require shareholder approval. Among other things, Scotts Miracle-Gro\u2019s controlling interest could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if a proposed acquisition would be beneficial to you, and you may not realize the premium return that stockholders may realize in conjunction with corporate takeovers.\nIn addition, Scotts Miracle-Gro has control over our business strategy, operations, managerial decisions and potential capital transactions. Your ability to influence key corporate decisions has been significantly diminished and you may disagree with decisions made by Scotts Miracle-Gro. The price of our common stock may be adversely affected and your ownership may be subject to substantial dilution.\nScotts Miracle-Gro has proposed potential transactions that may pose serious conflicts of interest, may result in cessation of the Company\u2019s status as a publicly traded company and SEC-reporting company, and may result in liquidation of the common stock held by minority shareholders at a price that may not represent the full future value of your common stock.\nAs disclosed above, Scotts Miracle-Gro currently owns more than 80% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock and has effective control of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors is comprised of three members who are affiliated with Scotts Miracle-Gro and two members who are not affiliated with Scotts Miracle-Gro (the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d).\nAs disclosed in a Schedule 13D/A filed with the SEC by Scotts Miracle-Gro on March 2, 2020, Scotts Miracle-Gro has discussed, with both our Board of Directors and our management team, the Company\u2019s operating model and ownership structure, which Scotts Miracle-Gro deems to be complex, and the costs incurred as a result of these perceived complexities. As described in the Scotts Miracle-Gro Schedule 13D/A, Scotts Miracle-Gro made an unsolicited proposal that recommended a range of operational adjustments for consideration by the AeroGrow Board (including the Independent Directors) that would effectively outsource most of AeroGrow\u2019s operations to Scotts Miracle-Gro or an affiliate of Scotts Miracle-Gro. Scotts Miracle-Gro believes that the outsourcing of most of AeroGrow\u2019s operations to Scotts Miracle-Gro or an affiliate of Scotts Miracle-Gro would: (i) simplify AeroGrow\u2019s organizational structure; (ii) significantly reduce AeroGrow\u2019s operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses; (iii) result in the liquidation of all or a significant amount of AeroGrow\u2019s working capital and tangible assets; and (iv) significantly decrease the Company\u2019s need for financing.\nWith regard to AeroGrow\u2019s ownership structure, Scotts Miracle-Gro\u2019s proposal discussed the burdens imposed on the Company as a result of its status as a publicly-traded and SEC-reporting company. At the Board Meeting, Scotts Miracle-Gro suggested that AeroGrow\u2019s Board (including the Independent Directors) consider consummating a reverse stock split pursuant to Section 78.207 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, which could be effected by AeroGrow\u2019s Board without stockholder approval. The consummation of a reverse stock split would decrease the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock held by each record holder and the number of authorized shares of Common Stock by a factor determined by the Company\u2019s Board.\nPursuant to the Scotts Miracle-Gro proposal, after giving effect to the reverse stock split, any stockholders holding fractional shares of Common Stock, would receive cash in exchange for their fractional shares based on the value of the Common Stock, as determined in good faith by the Company\u2019s Board. The consummation of a reverse stock split would reduce the number of record stockholders to a number that would cause the Common Stock to (i) cease being quoted on the OTCQB and (ii) become eligible for termination of registration by the SEC under the federal securities laws (commonly referred to as a \u201cgoing private\u201d transaction).\nAfter receiving Scotts Miracle-Gro\u2019s unsolicited proposal, the Board formed a special committee (the \u201cSpecial Committee\u201d) consisting of the Independent Directors to consider and evaluate any proposals offered by Scotts Miracle-Gro, including the potential \u201cgoing-private\u201d transaction described in Scotts Miracle-Gro\u2019s Schedule 13D/A filing. Although the Independent Directors did initially discuss and ask questions relating to Scotts Miracle-Gro\u2019s proposal and other potential alternatives, the Independent Directors have not agreed to pursue Scotts Miracle-Gro\u2019s proposal or any other course of action. The Special Committee has retained independent legal and financial advisors to assist in its review and evaluation of the Scotts Miracle-Gro proposed transaction to identify and evaluate potential alternatives. The Special Committee intends to use such advisors to consider and evaluate the terms of any current or future proposal offered by Scotts Miracle-Gro, as well as any other potential alternatives.\nThe Board cautions the Company\u2019s stockholders and others considering trading in the Company\u2019s securities that the Board and the Special Committee are in process of reviewing and evaluating the Scotts Miracle-Gro proposal as well as potential alternatives and have not made any decisions with respect to the Scotts Miracle-Gro proposal or any potential alternatives. There can be no assurance that any agreement with respect to the proposed transaction will be executed or that this or any other transaction will be approved or consummated. There is a risk that there will be situations when interests of Scotts Miracle-Gro (or its affiliated persons and entities) and the Company or the Company\u2019s minority shareholders will differ, creating the possibility of a conflict of interest.\nAlthough the Special Committee, when considering and making investment decisions, shall take into account the information presented to it about potential or existing conflicts of interest, and shall strive to ensure that the Company\u2019s minority shareholders are treated fairly, there can be no assurance that the minority shareholders will receive the full economic value of their shares.\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate greatly. Investors in AeroGrow common stock bear the risk that they will not recover their investment.\nOur common stock, like that of many emerging growth companies, is typically subject to price and volume volatility. Trading in our common stock is limited, and the price per share is likely to be influenced by the price at which and the amount of shares that selling security holders are attempting to sell at any time. If a large stockholder, including Scotts Miracle-Gro and its affiliates, decided to sell its shares, the price of our common stock would decline. Our common stock may also be subject to the activities of persons engaged in short selling securities, which generally has the effect of driving the price down. The price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely. A full and stable trading market for our common stock may never develop and, as a result, stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at the time they elect, if at all.\nWe can issue debt securities and shares of preferred stock without approval of common stockholders, which could adversely affect your rights and undermine the value of your shares.\nOur Articles of Incorporation allow our Board of Directors to approve the terms and conditions of debt securities and preferred stock for issuance by the Company, including but not limited to voting rights, conversion privileges and liquidation preferences, without the approval of common stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock may be adversely impacted as a result of the rights that could potentially be granted to holders of debt securities or preferred stock that we may issue. As a result, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by future issuances of debt or preferred stock.\nRisks Related to our Business, Products and Markets\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since inception and are starting to optimize operations and achieve profitability.\nSince we commenced operations in 2002, and through March 31, 2020, we incurred substantial losses, however, for the current year we have a net income of $57,000 for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2020, our losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $128.3 million. The future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to use the Scotts Miracle-Gro partnership to: (i) profitably expand sales of our AeroGarden indoor garden systems, seed pod kits and accessory products; (ii) develop new product extensions and applications; and (iii) efficiently spend marketing dollars to gain customer acceptance.\nOur financial condition may limit our ability to borrow funds or to raise additional equity as may be required to fund our future operations.\nOur ability to borrow funds or raise additional equity may be limited by our financial condition. In addition, a failure to obtain additional funding to support our working capital and operating requirements could prevent us from making expenditures that are needed to allow us to grow our operations. In the event we cannot raise additional funding to fulfill working capital needs, we will have to scale back on our operating plans for the current and future fiscal years. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the additional capital in an amount and in time to support all of our operating plans.\nAs we grow our sales into the retail channel and increase sales through individual retailers, the loss or significant reductions in orders from our top retail customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn Fiscal 2020, our net sales to one retail customer, Amazon.com, Inc., totaled 56.9% of our total net sales to retailers and 36.6% of our total net sales. The loss of this customer or other significant customers, or a significant decline in orders, could materially affect our sales of indoor garden systems, seed pod kits and accessories, and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe do not have long-term sales agreements with, or other contractual assurances as to future sales to any of our current or planned major retail customers. In addition, our business may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailers, such as payment terms, shelf space limitations, price demands and other conditions.\nOur future success is completely dependent on our ability to market our indoor garden systems, seed pod kits and accessory products and generate consumer acceptance on a broader scale.\nWe have introduced our indoor garden systems and seed pod kits as new products to consumer markets unfamiliar with their use and benefits. Although we believe that we have penetrated only a small portion of the potential market for our products, our marketing efforts may not generate widespread consumer adoption. If our marketing strategies fail to attract customers, our product sales may not produce future revenue sufficient to meet our operating expenses or fund our future operations. Our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nA worsening of the economy, particularly in the United States and Canada, could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business operations depends significantly on consumer confidence and discretionary spending, which deteriorated during the worldwide economic downturn in 2008-2012. A recurrence of the economic downturn, COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent impact on consumer spending, particularly in the United States and Canada, could adversely impact our revenue, ability to market our products, build customer loyalty, or otherwise implement our business strategy. In particular, changes in the level of consumer demand resulting from national health epidemics, such as the recent COVID-19 virus, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur revenue and level of business activity are highly seasonal, requiring us to staff our operations, incur overhead and marketing costs, purchase and manufacture inventory, and incur other operating costs in advance of having firm customer orders for our products. A material variance in actual orders relative to anticipated orders could have an adverse impact on our business.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, approximately 60.6% of our total net sales occurred during four consecutive calendar months (October through January). We must therefore estimate sales in advance of the anticipated peak months and operate our business during the balance of the year in such a way as to insure that we can meet the demand for our products during the peak months. This requires us to incur significant operating, marketing, and overhead expenses, and to utilize cash and other capital resources to invest in inventory in advance of having certainty as to the ultimate level of demand for our product during the peak months. Shortfalls in the supply of our products could result in a significant loss of revenue due to lack of adequate product inventory. Possible demand could decline if events such as the global COVID-19 pandemic adversely affect our customers. For example, the cobranding of our product with the \u201cMiracle-Gro AeroGarden\u201d trade name caused a delay in available inventory during the first six months of Fiscal 2014. Additionally, during the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2013, a labor strike in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach delayed the delivery of AeroGarden inventory during the critical pre-Christmas season and caused a decline in sales during that time period. Alternatively, a shortfall in actual demand for our products, relative to forecast, during peak months could cause us to liquidate excess inventory at a loss or at substantially lower margins. In any of these cases, we may not generate enough revenue to cover expenses incurred throughout the balance of the year. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur current or future manufacturers could fail to fulfill our orders for indoor garden systems, which would disrupt our business, increase our costs, and could potentially cause us to lose our market.\nWe currently depend on four contract manufacturers in China to produce our indoor garden systems. These manufacturers could fail to produce the indoor garden system to our specifications or in a workmanlike manner and may not deliver the systems on a timely basis. Our manufacturers must also obtain inventories of the necessary parts and tools for production. Although we own the tools and dies used by our manufacturers, our manufacturers operate in China. As a result, our manufacturers may be subject to business risks that fall outside our control, including but not limited to, political, global COVID-19 pandemic, currency, regulatory and shipping/transportation risks, each of which may affect the manufacturer\u2019s ability to fulfill our orders for indoor garden systems. As discussed in the preceding risk factor, the December 2012 labor strike in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach delayed the delivery of AeroGarden inventory during the critical pre-Christmas season and caused a decline in sales during the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2013. In addition, port congestion in October 2014 backed up deliveries and delayed ground transportation during the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. Pandemics, weather or natural disasters in China could disrupt our supply of product. Any change in manufacturers could disrupt or delay our ability to fulfill orders for indoor garden systems while we search for alternative supply sources, provide specifications, and test initial production. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur current AeroGarden manufacturers are located in China and therefore our product costs may be subject to fluctuations in the value of the dollar against the Chinese currency and increases in Chinese labor rates.\nAlthough we purchase our AeroGarden products in U.S. dollars, the prices charged by our factories are predicated upon their cost for components, labor and overhead. Therefore, increases in Chinese labor rates and changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Chinese currency may cause our manufacturers to raise prices of our products, which could reduce our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in tariffs or other taxes on our products or equipment and supplies could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nWe purchase a significant portion of supplies from suppliers outside the United States. The United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Further tariffs, additional taxes, or trade barriers may increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions.\nWe are highly reliant upon a single distribution and assembly facility. Any material disruption to the operation of this facility could adversely affect our business.\nAll of our North American fulfillment and distribution operations, and the entirety of our seed pod kit assembly operations are located in a third-party-managed facility based in Mexico, Missouri. Any material disruption to the operation of this facility, whether caused by internal or external factors could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party providers in our manufacturing, warehouse, distribution, order processing, and fulfillment operations. If these parties are unwilling to continue providing services to us, or are unable to adequately perform such services for us on a cost effective basis, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe engage third parties to perform certain critical functions supporting our business operations. Any disruption in our relationship with any of our vendors could cause significant disruption to our business and we may not be able to locate another party that can provide comparable services in a manner that is timely, consistent with our business plan, or on acceptable commercial terms. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may face significant competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our sales may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our complete indoor garden systems offer significant benefits over traditional hydroponic industry products. However, there are companies in a variety of related markets, including but not limited to, consumer electronics, commercial hydroponics, gardening wholesale, and soil-based gardening that are larger, better funded, and have experience in our channels of distribution. These companies may decide to develop products to compete with our products. These companies could use hydroponic technologies, and could achieve better consumer acceptance. The success of any competing products may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in energy prices, resulting from general economic conditions, or other factors, may raise our cost of goods sold and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEnergy costs, especially gasoline and fuel costs, are significant expenses in the delivery of our products. Increased costs resulting from general economic conditions, war, acts of nature, or other factors, may result in declining margins and operating results if market conditions prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases on our products. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our indoor garden systems fail to perform properly, our business could incur increased warranty-related costs and reduced income.\nFrom our inception through March 31, 2020, we have sold approximately 2.6 million AeroGardens and have provided a limited warranty with each garden sold. In addition, our indoor garden systems are \u201cguaranteed to grow.\u201d We therefore may be required to replace or repair products or refund the purchase price to consumers. Failure of our products to meet expectations could damage our reputation, decrease sales, increase costs related to returns and repairs, delay market acceptance of our products, result in unpaid accounts receivable, and divert our resources to remedy the malfunctions. The occurrence of any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to recruit, train and retain key personnel necessary to operate our business, our ability to successfully manage our business and develop and market our products may be harmed.\nTo maintain our business position, we will need to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled design, development, management, accounting, sales, merchandising, marketing, and customer service personnel. Competition for many of these types of personnel can be intense, depending on general economic conditions, alternative employment options, and job location. As a result, we may be unable to successfully attract or retain qualified personnel. Additionally, any of our officers or employees can terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of any key employee, or our inability to attract or retain other qualified employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to litigation that, if decided adversely to us, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters, in most cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to such litigation. Although we do not believe that any current litigation poses a material threat to our business, defense of any lawsuits or proceedings, even if successful, may require management to spend a substantial time and attention on the part of our management personnel that otherwise would be spent on other aspects of our business, and may require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. Settlement of lawsuits also may result in significant payments and modifications to our operations. In addition, we also may be subject to adverse publicity as a result of litigation. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by our Company may adversely impact our operations.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain development, operating and sales activities. We depend on digital technology to communicate with our employees, third-party manufacturers, partners and customers. We have been the subject of cyber-attacks on our internal systems and through those of third parties. Nevertheless, unauthorized access to our proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to leaks of customer-sensitive information, data corruption, communication interruption, or other disruptions in our sales, product development, and production or planned business transactions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. In Fiscal 2019, we discovered that certain of our information technology systems had been the target of an external cyber-attack, as more fully described under Note 7, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisk Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAn occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and distribution. These factors, in turn, may not only impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our goods and services but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many other companies and countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products including access to brick and mortar store locations and significantly impact our operating results. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAs the result of current restrictions put in place to address COVID-19, we have had limited access to our corporate offices and our corporate staff has been required to work remotely, disrupting interactions among our staff, with our customers and suppliers, and with our accountants, consultants and advisors. The extent to which our results may continue to be affected by COVID-19 will largely depend on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, governmental and business responses to the pandemic and the impact on the global economy, our customers\u2019 demand for our products, and our ability to provide our products and access our offices and facilities. While these factors are uncertain, the COVID-19 pandemic or the perception of its effects could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 92086, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "AERO"}
