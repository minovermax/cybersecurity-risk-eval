RISK FACTORS\nWhen evaluating the Company, the following discussion of risk factors, which contains forward-looking statements as discussed in Part I \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements\u201d above, should be considered in conjunction\nwith the other information contained in this Annual Report. If we are unable to mitigate and/or are exposed to any of the following risks in the future, then there could be a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nOur business is subject to economic, business and regulatory factors affecting the truckload industry that are largely beyond our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe truckload industry is highly cyclical, and our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a negative impact on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that some of the most significant of these factors are economic changes that affect supply and demand in transportation markets that could have a material adverse effect, such as:\n\u25cf recessionary economic cycles;\n\u25cf changes in customers\u2019 inventory levels and practices, including shrinking product/package sizes, and in the availability of funding for their working capital;\n\u25cf excess truck capacity in comparison with shipping demand;\n\u25cf driver shortages and increases in drivers\u2019 compensation;\n\u25cf industry compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements; and\n\u25cf downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles, including as a result of declines in consumer spending.\nAdditionally, economic conditions that decrease shipping demand or increase the supply of available tractors and trailers can exert downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization, thereby decreasing asset productivity. The risks associated with these factors are heightened when the U.S. economy is weakened. Some of the principal risks during such times are as follows:\n\u25cf we may experience low overall freight levels, which may impair our asset utilization;\n\u25cf certain of our customers may face credit issues and cash flow problems that may lead to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could result in even lower freight demand and may require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts;\n\u25cf freight patterns may change as supply chains are redesigned, resulting in an imbalance between our capacity and our customers\u2019 freight demand;\n\u25cf customers may solicit bids for freight from multiple trucking companies or select competitors that offer lower rates from among existing choices in an attempt to lower their costs, and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight; and\n\u25cf we may be forced to accept more loads from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads.\nWe are also subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, increases in fuel prices, driver and office employee wages, purchased transportation costs, interest rates, taxes, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance, revenue equipment and related maintenance, tires and other components and healthcare and other benefits for our employees. Further, we may not be able to appropriately adjust our costs to changing market demands. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs. Further, we may not be able to appropriately adjust our costs to changing market demands.\nIn addition, events outside our control, such as deterioration of U.S. transportation infrastructure and reduced investment in such infrastructure, strikes or other work stoppages at our facilities or at customer, port, border or other shipping locations, armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state or heightened security requirements could lead to wear, tear and damage to our equipment, driver dissatisfaction, reduced economic demand and freight volumes, reduced availability of credit, increased prices for fuel or\ntemporary closing of the shipping locations or U.S. borders. Such events or enhanced security measures in connection with such events could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nWe may not be successful in achieving our business strategies.\nMany of our business strategies require time, significant management and financial resources and successful implementation. Consequently, we may be unable to effectively and successfully implement our business strategies. We also cannot ensure that our operating results, including our operating margins, will not be materially adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business, including the expected expansion of Variant and our Brokerage digital platform, and our increased focus on the implementation of technology to improve our execution and reduce friction, or by changes in economic conditions. Further, many of our strategic initiatives are focused on the development and deployment of technology. These new technology-driven initiatives have a high degree of risk, as they involve unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or no prior experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they may involve unforeseen expenses and regulatory and other risks. There can be no assurance that these initiatives will generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that technology developed or deployed by others will render our technology noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development and deployment efforts with respect to new technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our historical operations. Despite the implementation of our operational and tactical strategies and initiatives, we may be unsuccessful in achieving a reduction in our operating ratio in the time frames we expect or at all. Further, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected by a failure to transition our legacy OTR fleet to Variant, further penetrate our existing customer base, cross-sell our services, secure new customer opportunities and manage the operations and expenses of new or growing services. There is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving any of our business strategies. Even if we are successful in executing our business strategies, we still may not achieve our goals.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to improve our profitability and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nNumerous competitive factors could impair our ability to improve our profitability and materially adversely affect our results of operations, including:\n\u25cf we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and service offerings (including intermodal) and, to a lesser extent, with (i) less-than-truckload carriers, (ii) railroads and (iii) other transportation and brokerage companies, several of which have access to more equipment and greater capital resources than we do;\n\u25cf many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain or expand our business or may require us to reduce our freight rates in order to maintain business and keep our equipment productive;\n\u25cf we may increase the size of our fleet during periods of high freight demand during which our competitors also increase their capacity, and we may experience losses in greater amounts than such competitors during subsequent cycles of softened freight demand if we are required to dispose of assets at a loss to match reduced freight demand;\n\u25cf we may have difficulty recruiting and retaining drivers because upgrades of our tractor fleet to match or exceed those of our competitors may not increase our cost savings or profitability;\n\u25cf some of our larger customers are other transportation companies and/or also operate their own private trucking fleets, and they may decide to transport more of their own freight;\n\u25cf some shippers have reduced or may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting preferred carriers as approved service providers or by engaging dedicated providers, and we may not be selected;\n\u25cf consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages, and we may have difficulty competing with them;\n\u25cf our competitors may have better safety records than us or a perception of better safety records;\n\u25cf competition from freight brokerage companies may materially adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates;\n\u25cf\nnew digital entrants with cheaper sources of capital could inhibit our ability to compete;\n\u25cf\nour competitors may have better technology that may lead to increased operating efficiencies, reduced costs, a better ability to recruit drivers and more demand for their services, and\n\u25cf economies of scale that procurement aggregation providers may pass on to smaller carriers may improve such carriers\u2019 ability to compete with us.\nWe may not make acquisitions in the future, which could impede growth, or if we do, we may not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, a key component of our growth strategy has been to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses. We currently do not expect to make any material acquisitions over the next few years, which could impede growth. If we do make acquisitions, we cannot assure that we will be successful in negotiating, consummating or integrating the acquisitions. If we succeed in consummating future acquisitions, our business, financial condition and results of operations, may be materially adversely affected because:\n\u25cf some of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenue, earnings or cash flows;\n\u25cf we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or otherwise exceed our estimates;\n\u25cf we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, or at all, and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\u25cf acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and divert our resources;\n\u25cf we may experience difficulties operating in markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience;\n\u25cf we may incur transactions costs and acquisition-related integration costs;\n\u25cf we could lose customers, employees and drivers of any acquired company;\n\u25cf we may incur additional indebtedness; and\n\u25cf we may issue additional shares of our Class A common stock, which would dilute the ownership of our then-existing stockholders.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nIncreases in driver compensation or difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could materially adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our fleet.\nLike many truckload carriers, we experience substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers, which includes the engagement of independent contractors. Our industry is subject to a shortage of qualified drivers. Such shortage is exacerbated during periods of economic expansion, in which alternative employment opportunities, including in the construction and manufacturing industries, which may offer better compensation and/or more time at home, are more plentiful and freight demand increases, or during periods of economic downturns, in which unemployment benefits might be extended and financing is limited for independent contractors who seek to purchase equipment, or the scarcity or growth of loans for students who seek financial aid for driving school. Furthermore, capacity at driving schools may be limited by COVID-19 related social distancing requirements. Regulatory requirements, including those related to safety ratings, ELDs and hours-of-service changes and an improved economy could further reduce the pool of eligible drivers or force us to increase driver compensation to attract and retain drivers. We have seen evidence that stricter hours-of-service regulations adopted by the DOT in the past have tightened, and, to the extent new regulations are enacted, may continue to tighten, the market for eligible drivers. The lack of adequate tractor parking along some U.S. highways and congestion caused by inadequate highway funding may make it more difficult for drivers to comply with hours-of-service regulations and cause added stress for drivers, further reducing the pool of eligible drivers. We have implemented driver pay increases to address this shortage and we are implementing initiatives aimed at reducing the daily friction faced by our drivers in hopes of reducing turnover. However, the compensation we offer our drivers and independent contractor expenses are subject to market conditions and our initiatives to reduce driver turnover may prove unsuccessful, therefore we may find it necessary to further increase driver compensation, change the structure of our driver\ncompensation and/or become subject to increased independent contractor expenses in future periods, which could materially adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nIn addition, we suffer from a high turnover rate of drivers and our turnover rate is higher than the industry average and compared to our peers. This high turnover rate requires us to spend significant resources recruiting a substantial number of drivers in order to operate existing revenue equipment and subjects us to a higher degree of risk with respect to driver shortages than our competitors. Our use of team-driven tractors in our expedited service offering requires two drivers per tractor, which further increases the number of drivers we must recruit and retain in comparison to operations that require one driver per tractor. Our driver hiring standards, including hair follicle drug testing, could further reduce the pool of available drivers from which we would hire. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers, we could be forced to, among other things, continue to adjust our compensation packages or operate with fewer tractors and face difficulty meeting shipper demands, either of which could materially adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nOur engagement of independent contractors to provide a portion of our capacity exposes us to different risks than we face with our tractors driven by company drivers.\nOur contracts with independent contractors are governed by the federal leasing regulations, which impose specific requirements on us and the independent contractors. If more stringent federal leasing regulations are adopted, independent contractors could be deterred from becoming independent contractor drivers, which could materially adversely affect our goal of maintaining our current fleet levels of independent contractors.\nWe provide financing to certain qualified independent contractors. If we are unable to provide such financing in the future, due to liquidity constraints or other restrictions, we may experience a decrease in the number of independent contractors we are able to engage. Further, if independent contractors we engage default under or otherwise terminate the financing arrangement and we are unable to find a replacement independent contractor or seat the tractor with a company driver, we may incur losses on amounts owed to us with respect to the tractor.\nWe have several major customers, and the loss of, or significant reduction of business with, one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from a small number of major customers, the loss of, or significant reduction of business with, one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. A substantial portion of our freight is from customers in the retail industry. As such, our volumes are largely dependent on consumer spending and retail sales, and our results may be more susceptible to trends in unemployment and retail sales than carriers that do not have this concentration. In addition, our major customers engage in bid processes and other activities periodically (including currently) in an attempt to lower their costs of transportation. We may not choose to participate in these bids or, if we participate, may not be awarded the freight, either of which circumstances could result in a reduction of our freight volumes with these customers. In this event, we could be required to replace the volumes elsewhere at uncertain rates and volumes, suffer reduced equipment utilization or reduce the size of our fleet. Failure to retain our existing customers, or enter into relationships with new customers, each on acceptable terms, could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to meet our current and long-term financial forecasts.\nOur customers\u2019 financial difficulties can negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to comply with the covenants under our debt agreements, especially if they were to delay or default on payments to us. Generally, we do not have contractual relationships that guarantee any minimum volumes with our customers, and we cannot assure you that our customer relationships will continue as presently in effect. Our dedicated contract service offering is typically subject to longer term written contracts than our OTR service offering. However, certain of these contracts contain cancellation clauses, including our \u201cevergreen\u201d contracts, which automatically renew for one year terms but that can be terminated more easily. There is no assurance any of our customers, including our dedicated contract customers, will continue to utilize our services, renew our existing contracts, or continue at the same volume levels. Despite the existence of contractual arrangements with our customers, certain of our customers may nonetheless engage in competitive bidding processes that could negatively impact our contractual relationship. In addition, certain of our major customers may increasingly use their own truckload and delivery fleets, which would reduce our freight volumes. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers, including our dedicated contract customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of fuel or surcharge collection may increase our costs of operation, which could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nFuel is one of our largest operating expenses. Diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as political events, terrorist activities, armed conflicts, commodity futures trading, depreciation of the dollar against other currencies, weather events and other natural or man-made disasters, each of which may lead to an increase in the cost of fuel. Fuel prices also are affected by the rising demand for fuel in developing countries, including China, and could be materially adversely affected by the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production and by diminished drilling activity. Such events may lead not only to increases in fuel prices, but also to fuel shortages and disruptions in the fuel supply chain. Because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, significant diesel fuel cost increases, shortages, rationings, or supply disruptions would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuel also is subject to regional pricing differences and is often more expensive on the West Coast of the United States, where we have operations. Increases in fuel costs, to the extent not offset by rate per mile increases or fuel surcharges, have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. While we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers, which historically have helped us offset the majority of the negative impact of rising fuel prices associated with loaded or billed miles, we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs, such as those associated with non-revenue generating miles, the time when our engines are idling and fuel for refrigeration units on our refrigerated trailers. Moreover, the terms of each customer\u2019s fuel surcharge program vary, and certain customers have sought to modify the terms of their fuel surcharge programs to minimize recoverability for fuel price increases. In addition, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially when prices are rising. This could lead to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement, which have occurred in the past. During periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose fuel surcharge policies that provide a lower reimbursement of our fuel costs. There is no assurance that our fuel surcharge program can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective. Our results of operations would be negatively affected to the extent we cannot recover higher fuel costs or fail to improve our fuel price protection through our fuel surcharge program.\nWe depend on third-party service providers, particularly in our Brokerage segment, and service instability from these providers could increase our operating costs and reduce our ability to offer brokerage services, which could materially adversely affect our revenue, business, financial condition, results of operations and customer relationships.\nOur Brokerage segment is dependent upon the services of third-party carriers, including other truckload carriers. For this business, we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers\u2019 freight and we do not employ the providers directly involved in delivering the freight. These third-party providers may seek other freight opportunities and/or require increased compensation in times of improved freight demand or tight truckload capacity. If we are unable to secure the services of these third parties or if we become subject to increases in the prices we must pay to secure such services, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and we may be unable to serve our customers on competitive terms. Our ability to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services may be affected by many risks beyond our control, including equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers, new entrants with different business models, interruptions in service due to labor disputes, driver shortage, changes in regulations impacting transportation and changes in transportation rates.\nWe are dependent on systems, networks and other information technology assets (and the data contained therein) and a failure in the foregoing, including those caused by cybersecurity breaches, could cause a significant disruption to our business and we may incur increasing costs in efforts to minimize those risks and comply with regulatory standards.\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our systems, networks and other information technology assets (and the data contained therein). This includes information and electronic data interchange systems that we have developed, both by creating these systems in-house or by adapting purchased or off-the-shelf applications to suit our needs. Our information and electronic data interchange systems are used for receiving and planning loads, dispatching drivers and other capacity providers, billing customers and load tracking and storing the data related to the foregoing activities. If we are unable to prevent system violations or other unauthorized access to our systems, networks and other information technology assets (and the data contained therein), we could be subject to significant fines and lawsuits and our reputation could be damaged, or our business operations could be interrupted, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business operations. Furthermore, recently enacted data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act that became effective on January 1, 2020 and provides new data privacy\nrights for consumers and operational requirements for companies, may result in increased liability and amplified compliance and monitoring costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business operations.\nOur operations, and those of our technology and communications service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, network disruptions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, malicious intrusions, computer viruses and other events that may be beyond our control. Furthermore, many of our strategic initiatives would require further integration of technology into our operations, which could exacerbate the effects of any such interruption. If any of our critical information technology assets fail or become otherwise unavailable, whether as a result of a cybersecurity breach, upgrade project or otherwise, we would have to perform certain functions manually, which could temporarily impact our ability to manage our fleet efficiently, respond to customers\u2019 requests effectively, maintain billing and other records reliably, and bill for services and prepare financial statements accurately or in a timely manner. Although we maintain business interruption insurance, it may be inadequate to protect us in the event of an unforeseeable and extreme catastrophe. Any significant system failure, upgrade complication, security breach or other system disruption could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers or impact our ability to manage our operations and report our financial performance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are currently dependent on a single vendor platform to support certain information technology functions. If the stability or capability of such vendor is compromised and we were forced to migrate to a new platform, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the credit, reputational and relationship risks of certain of our current and former equity investments.\nCertain of our former equity investments, including Parker Global Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cParker\u201d), XPS Logisti-K Systems, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (\u201cLogisti-K\u201d), Dylka Distribuciones Logisti-K S.A. de C.V. (\u201cDylka\u201d) and Xpress Internacional, have amounts owing to us. Furthermore, we may have overlapping customers and vendors with Parker, Logisti-K, Dylka and Xpress Internacional. Any financial hardships of Parker, Logisti-K, Dylka, or Xpress Internacional could lead to delay or nonpayment of amounts owed to us, strain our relationships with overlapping customers and vendors, and damage our reputation. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such risks may be heightened during a weak freight environment.\nManagement and key employee turnover or failure to attract and retain qualified management and other key personnel, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the leadership and expertise of our executive management team and other key personnel to design and execute our strategic and operating plans. While we have employment agreements in place with these executives, there can be no assurance we will continue to retain their services and we may become subject to significant severance payments if our relationship with these executives is terminated under certain circumstances. Further, turnover, planned or otherwise, in these or other key leadership positions may materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business efficiently and effectively, and such turnover can be disruptive and distracting to management, may lead to additional departures of existing personnel and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future profitability. We must recruit, develop and retain a core group of managers to realize our goal of expanding our operations, improving our earnings consistency and positioning ourselves for long-term operating revenue growth.\nOur business depends on our reputation and the value of the U.S. Xpress brand.\nWe believe that the U.S. Xpress brand name symbolizes high-quality service and reliability and is a significant sales and marketing tool to which we devote substantial resources to promote and protect. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, related to activities by our drivers, independent contractors or agents, such as accidents, customer service issues or noncompliance with laws, could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of value in our brand could reduce the demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\nDifficulty in obtaining materials, equipment, goods and services from our vendors and suppliers could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent upon our suppliers for certain products and materials, including our tractors, trailers and chassis. If we fail to maintain favorable relationships with our vendors and suppliers, or if our vendors and suppliers are unable to provide the products and materials we need or undergo financial hardship, we could experience difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services because of production interruptions, limited material availability or other reasons, or we may not be able to obtain favorable pricing or other terms. As a result, our business and operations could be adversely affected.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather and other catastrophic events affect our operations and profitability.\nOur tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season. Revenue may also be adversely affected by inclement weather and holidays, since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and higher equipment repair expenditures. We also may suffer from weather-related or other unforeseen events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, damage or destroy our assets or adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile.\nCOMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe retain high deductibles on a significant portion of our claims exposure, which could significantly increase the volatility of, and decrease the amount of, our earnings and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe retain high deductibles on a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses associated with third-party bodily injury and property damage, employee medical expenses, workers\u2019 compensation, physical damage to our equipment and cargo loss. With respect to our third-party insurance, reduced capacity in the insurance market for trucking risks can make it more difficult to obtain both primary and excess insurance, can necessitate procuring insurance offshore, and could result in increases in collateral requirements on those primary lines that require securitization. For a description of our insurance coverage, please see \"Insurance\" under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nIf any claim were to exceed coverage limits, we would bear the excess in addition to our other retained amounts. Our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we could find it necessary to raise our retained amounts or decrease our coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our initiatives aimed at reducing insurance premiums and claims expense, such as installation of forward-facing event recorders, hair follicle drug testing, and additional driver training, could prove unsuccessful. In addition, although we endeavor to limit our exposure arising with respect to such claims, we also may have exposure if carriers hired by our Brokerage segment are inadequately insured for any accident. Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if (i) these expenses increase, (ii) we are unable to find excess coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, (iii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iv) we experience a claim for which we do not have coverage or for which our insurance carriers fail to pay or (v) we experience increased accidents. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses for deductibles and retentions due to our accident experience.\nIf we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because claims prove to be more severe than our recorded liabilities, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe accrue the costs of the uninsured portion of pending claims based on estimates derived from our evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based upon historical claims development trends. Actual settlement of our retained claim liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties, including evaluation of severity, legal costs and claims that have been incurred but not reported. Due to our high retained amounts, we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because our estimates are revised or the claims ultimately prove to be more severe than originally assessed, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIncreases in collateral requirements that support our insurance program and could materially adversely affect our operations.\nTo comply with certain state insurance regulatory requirements, cash and/or cash equivalents must be paid to certain of our third-party insurers, to state regulators and to our captive insurance companies and restricted as collateral to ensure payment for anticipated losses. Significant future increases in the amount of collateral required by third-party insurance carriers and regulators would reduce our liquidity and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and capital resources.\nInsuring risk through our captive insurance companies could materially adversely affect our operations.\nWe utilize two captive insurers to transfer or fund risks. Mountain Lake Risk Retention Group, Inc. (\u201cMountain Lake RRG\u201d) is a state-regulated, captive risk retention group owned by two of our operating subsidiaries, U.S. Xpress, Inc. and Total Transportation of Mississippi LLC (\u201cTotal\u201d). Mountain Lake RRG writes the primary auto insurance liability policies for U.S. Xpress, Inc. and Total; a portion of this risk is transferred to Mountain Lake RRG and the remaining risk is retained as a deductible by the insured subsidiaries. Through our second captive insurer, Xpress Assurance, we participate as a reinsurer in certain third party risks related to various types of insurance policies sold to drivers who carry passengers in tractors and independent contractors engaged by U.S. Xpress, Inc. and Total. The use of the captives necessarily involves retaining certain risks that might otherwise be covered by traditional insurance products, and increases in the number or severity of claims that Mountain Lake RRG and Xpress Assurance insure have in the past, and could in the future, materially adversely affect our earnings, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe, our drivers, and our equipment are regulated by the DOT, the EPA, the DHS and other agencies in states in which we operate. For further discussion of the laws and regulations applicable to us, our drivers, and our equipment, please see \"Regulation\" under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d Future laws and regulations may be more stringent, require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or require us to incur significant additional costs. Higher costs incurred by us, or by our suppliers who pass the costs onto us through higher supplies and materials pricing, or liabilities we may incur related to our failure to comply with existing or future regulations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf the independent contractors we contract with are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nTax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors, and our classification of independent contractors has been the subject of audits by such authorities from time to time. Federal legislation has been introduced in the past that would make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to increase the penalties for companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees\u2019 overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, to extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors and to impose notice requirements based on employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenue from items such as unemployment, workers\u2019 compensation and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative. Recently, courts in certain states have issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. In September 2019, California enacted a law that made it more difficult for workers to be classified as independent contractors (as opposed to employees). For further discussion of this new California law, please see \"Regulation\" under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers\u2019 compensation and health care coverage. In addition, companies that use lease-purchase independent contractor programs, such as us, have been more susceptible to reclassification lawsuits, and several recent decisions have been made in favor of those seeking to classify independent contractor truck drivers as employees. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. If the independent contractors with whom we contract are determined to be employees, we would incur additional\nexposure under federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nDevelopments in labor and employment law and any unionizing efforts by employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face the risk that Congress, federal agencies or one or more states could approve legislation or regulations significantly affecting our businesses and our relationship with our employees which would have substantially liberalized the procedures for union organization. None of our domestic employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, but any attempt by our employees to organize a labor union could result in increased legal and other associated costs. Additionally, given the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s \u201cspeedy election\u201d rule, our ability to timely and effectively address any unionizing efforts would be difficult. If we entered into a collective bargaining agreement with our domestic employees, the terms could materially adversely affect our costs, efficiency and ability to generate acceptable returns on the affected operations.\nSafety-related evaluations and rankings under CSA could materially adversely affect our profitability and operations, our ability to maintain or grow our fleet and our customer relationships.\nUnder the CSA program, fleets are evaluated and ranked against their peers based on certain safety-related standards. As a result, our fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to peer carriers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We recruit and retain first-time drivers to be part of our fleet, and these drivers may have a higher likelihood of creating adverse safety events under CSA. The occurrence of future deficiencies could affect driver recruitment by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers or limit the pool of available drivers or could cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet safety rankings, either of which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, future deficiencies could increase our insurance expenses. Further, we may incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are currently exceeding the established intervention thresholds in one or more of the seven CSA safety-related categories. Based on these unfavorable ratings, we may be prioritized for an intervention action or roadside inspection, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, customers may be less likely to assign loads to us.\nReceipt of an unfavorable DOT safety rating could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe currently have a satisfactory DOT rating for our U.S. operations, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as customer contracts may require a satisfactory DOT safety rating, and a conditional or unsatisfactory rating could materially adversely affect or restrict our operations.\nThe FMCSA has proposed regulations that would modify the existing rating system and the safety labels assigned to motor carriers evaluated by the DOT. Under regulations that were proposed in 2016, the methodology for determining a carrier\u2019s DOT safety rating would be expanded to include the on-road safety performance of the carrier\u2019s drivers and equipment, as well as results obtained from investigations. Exceeding certain thresholds based on such performance or results would cause a carrier to receive an unfit safety rating. The proposed regulations were withdrawn in March 2017, but the FMCSA noted that a similar process may be initiated in the future. If similar regulations were enacted and we were to receive an unfit or other negative safety rating, our business would be materially adversely affected in the same manner as if we received a conditional or unsatisfactory safety rating under the current regulations. In addition, poor safety performance could lead to increased risk of liability, increased insurance, maintenance and equipment costs and potential loss of customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs and materially adversely affect our business.\nThe approach of President Biden\u2019s administration to tariffs and other trade regulations is still to be determined. The imposition of additional tariffs or quotas or changes to certain trade agreements, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the United States and China, could, among other things, increase the costs of the materials used by our suppliers\nto produce new revenue equipment or increase the price of fuel. Such cost increases for our revenue equipment suppliers would likely be passed on to us, and to the extent fuel prices increase, we may not be able to fully recover such increases through rate increases or our fuel surcharge program, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, applicants, independent contractor drivers, customers, vendors, government agencies, stockholders and other parties through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions and other processes. Recently, we and several other trucking companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, minimum wage, meal and rest periods, overtime eligibility and failure to pay for all hours worked. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial settlements or damages by other carriers.\nThe outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, such as our pending wage and hour class action lawsuit, the independent contractor putative class action lawsuit and the putative class action lawsuits arising out of our IPO, and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceeding.\u201d Additionally, the cost to defend litigation may also be significant. Not all claims are covered by our insurance (including wage and hour claims), and there can be no assurance that our coverage limits will be adequate to cover all amounts in dispute. To the extent we experience claims that are uninsured, exceed our coverage limits, involve significant aggregate use of our retention amounts, or cause increases in future premiums, the resulting expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be subject, and have been subject in the past, to litigation resulting from trucking accidents. The number and severity of litigation claims may be worsened by distracted driving by both truck drivers and other motorists. These lawsuits have resulted, and may result in the future, in the payment of substantial settlements or damages and increases of our insurance costs.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nOur existing and future indebtedness could limit our flexibility in operating our business or adversely affect our business and our liquidity position.\nWe have significant amounts of indebtedness outstanding, including obligations under a new credit facility we entered into in January 2020 that is structured as a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), equipment installment notes, finance leases and secured notes. As of December 31, 2020, we had indebtedness of $359.0 million. Our indebtedness may increase from time to time in the future for various reasons, including fluctuations in results of operations, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions. Any indebtedness we incur and restrictive covenants contained in financing agreements governing such indebtedness could:\n\u25cf make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including making interest payments on our debt obligations;\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional financing to operate our business;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt, reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and working capital and other general operational requirements;\n\u25cf expose us to the risk of increased interest rates relating to any of our indebtedness at variable rates;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and/or changing market conditions;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to some of our competitors that have less, or less restrictive, debt than us;\n\u25cf limit our ability to pursue acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures; and\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cause a significant decrease in our liquidity and impair our ability to pay amounts due on our indebtedness. Significant repayment penalties may limit our flexibility. In addition, our Credit Facility contains usual and\ncustomary restrictive covenants for a facility of this nature including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or issue guarantees, to create liens on our assets, to make distributions on or redeem equity interests, to make investments and to engage in mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions, and, if our excess availability is less than a specified amount, requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1:00:1:00.\nIn the future, we may need to obtain additional financing that may not be available or, if it is available, may result in a reduction in the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in order to:\n\u25cf finance unanticipated working capital requirements, capital investments or refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u25cf develop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing products and services;\n\u25cf fund strategic relationships;\n\u25cf respond to competitive pressures;\n\u25cf acquire complementary businesses, technologies, products or services; and\n\u25cf successfully scale our Variant fleet.\nIf the economy and/or the credit markets weaken, or we are unable to enter into capital or operating leases to acquire revenue equipment on terms favorable to us, our business, financial results and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, especially if consumer confidence declines and domestic spending decreases. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our strategic initiatives, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance technology or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders may be reduced, and holders of these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our then-existing stockholders.\nOur profitability may be materially adversely impacted if our capital investments do not match customer demand for invested resources or if there is a decline in the availability of funding sources for these investments.\nThe truckload industry generally, and our truckload offering in particular, is capital intensive and asset heavy, and our policy of maintaining a young, technology-equipped fleet requires us to expend significant amounts in capital expenditures annually. The amount and timing of such capital expenditures depend on various factors, including anticipated freight demand and the price and availability of assets. If anticipated demand differs materially from actual usage, our capital-intensive Truckload segment may have too many or too few assets. Moreover, resource requirements vary based on customer demand, which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions. During periods of decreased customer demand, our asset utilization may suffer.\nWe expect to pay for projected capital expenditures with cash flows from operations or financing available under our existing debt instruments. Although our business volume is not highly concentrated, our customers\u2019 financial failures or loss of customer business may materially adversely affect us. If we were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, we would need to seek alternative sources of capital, including financing, to meet our capital requirements. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our fleet size, enter into less favorable financing arrangements or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nIncreased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, future use of autonomous tractors, and volatility in the used equipment market, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and profitability.\nWe are subject to risk with respect to higher prices for new tractors. We have at times experienced an increase in prices for new tractors and the resale value of the tractors have not always increased to the same extent. Prices have increased and may continue to increase, due, in part, to (i) government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines, (ii) increases in commodity prices and (iii) and due to the pricing discretion of equipment manufacturers in periods of high demand. Compliance with EPA regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could impair equipment productivity, result in lower fuel mileage and increase our operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual\nvalues realized from the disposition of these vehicles, could increase our costs or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as the regulations become effective. Furthermore, future use of autonomous tractors could increase the price of new tractors and decrease the value of used non-autonomous tractors.\nA depressed market for used equipment could require us to trade our revenue equipment at depressed values or to record losses on disposal or impairments of the carrying values of our revenue equipment that is not protected by residual value arrangements. Used equipment prices are subject to substantial fluctuations based on freight demand, supply of used tractors, availability of financing, the presence of buyers for export to foreign countries and commodity prices for scrap metal. If there is a deterioration of resale prices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our revenue equipment financing arrangements have balloon payments at the end of the finance terms equal to the values we expect to be able to obtain in the used market. To the extent the used market values are lower than such balloon payments, we may be forced to sell the equipment at a loss and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses.\nWe have generated a profit in two of the last five years. Improving profitability depends upon numerous factors, including our ability to successfully execute both our ongoing and planned strategic initiatives, such as increasing our fleet efficiency and utilization, decreasing driver turnover and further refinement of our business mix profile. We may not be able to improve profitability in the future. If we are unable to improve our profitability, our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur total assets include goodwill and other intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, net income could be materially adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had recorded goodwill of $59.2 million and other intangible assets of $25.5 million primarily as a result of certain customer relationships connected with certain acquisition-related transactions and trade names. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid by us over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired by us. We may never realize the full value of our goodwill or intangible assets. Any future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a defendant in putative class action lawsuits and a stockholder derivative lawsuit arising out of our IPO and we may be involved in additional litigation in the future. Such lawsuits could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention.\nIn 2018, a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws was filed naming us and certain of our officers and directors as defendants. Plaintiffs also named as defendants the underwriters in our IPO. Since then, several other actions making substantially the same allegations have been filed. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits generally allege that our registration statement and prospectus related to our IPO contained materially false or misleading statements. Additionally, one of these lawsuits alleges that the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer made false and/or misleading statements and/or material omissions in press releases, earnings calls, investor conferences, television interviews, and filings made with the SEC subsequent to our IPO. Furthermore, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed against five of our executives and our independent board members (the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d), naming the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges that the Company made false and/or misleading statements in the registration statement and prospectus filed with the SEC in connection with our IPO and that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing or allowing the Company to make such statements. The complaint alleges that the Company has been damaged by the alleged wrongful conduct as a result of, among other things, being subjected to the time and expense of the securities class action lawsuits that have been filed relating to our IPO. In addition to a claim for alleged breach of fiduciary duties, the lawsuit alleges claims against the Individual Defendants for unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets.\nThese lawsuits may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. Although we deny the material allegations in the lawsuits and intend to defend ourselves vigorously, defending the lawsuits could result in substantial costs. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. In addition, we may be the target of securities-related litigation in the future, both related and unrelated to the existing class\naction lawsuits. Such litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, result in substantial damages, costs and expense and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally obligated to indemnify our current and former directors and officers in connection with lawsuits and related litigation or settlement amounts. We maintain director and officer insurance to protect us from such lawsuits, however, we are responsible for meeting certain deductibles under the policies. In addition, we cannot assure you that such policies will adequately protect us from lawsuits or that costs and expenses related to lawsuits will not exceed the coverage provided under such policies. Further, as a result of the pending lawsuits, the costs of director and officer insurance may increase and the availability of coverage may decrease. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our current levels of director and officer insurance at a reasonable cost, or at all, which might make it more difficult to attract qualified candidates to serve as executive officers or directors. The effect of these lawsuits involving our officers and directors and the resolution of these matters may result in significant damages, costs and expenses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe evaluate these and other litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the probability of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates, and any adverse resolution of litigation pending or threatened against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain members of the Fuller and Quinn families (or trusts for the benefit of any of them or entities owned by any of them), which limits or precludes the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has five votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, Messrs. Max Fuller and Eric Fuller and Ms. Lisa Pate (collectively, the \"Qualifying Stockholders\") and certain trusts for the benefit of any of them or their family members or certain entities owned by any of them or their family members (collectively with the Qualifying Stockholders, the \"Class B Stockholders\"), hold more than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the five-to-one voting ratio between our Class B common stock and Class A common stock, the Class B Stockholders collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 16.7% of all outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. The interests of the Class B Stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders, and they may take actions affecting us with which other stockholders disagree. For example, the Class B Stockholders could take actions that would have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders. In addition, certain of the Class B Stockholders have been engaged from time to time in certain related party transactions with us. Further, Messrs. Eric Fuller and Max Fuller and Mses. Pate and Janice Fuller, the wife of Max Fuller, have entered into a voting agreement (the \"Voting Agreement\") under which each has granted a voting proxy with respect to the shares of Class B common stock subject to the voting agreement. Mr. Eric Fuller and Ms. Janice Fuller have initially designated Mr. Max Fuller as his or her proxy and Mr. Max Fuller and Ms. Pate have each initially designated Mr. Eric Fuller as his or her proxy. Accordingly, upon death or incapacity of any of Messrs. Eric Fuller or Max Fuller or Ms. Pate, voting control would remain concentrated with certain members of the Fuller and/or Quinn families.\nFurthermore, as a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE rules, we qualify for and, in the future, may opt to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, including having a majority of independent directors, as well as having nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees composed entirely of independent directors. If in the future we choose to rely on such exemptions, the interests of our Qualifying Stockholders may differ from those of our other stockholders and the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nThe price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors outside of our control.\nIn addition, certain index providers, such as FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones, have announced restrictions that limit or preclude inclusion of companies with multiple-class share structures in certain indexes. Because of our dual-class structure, we may be excluded from these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our Class A common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Class A common stock and may otherwise adversely affect the price or liquidity of our Class A common stock.\nThe large number of shares of our Class B common stock pledged could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and increase volatility.\nEntities affiliated with Mr. Max Fuller have negatively pledged 8,261,776 shares of Class B common stock as security for a loan, as well as the equity of the entities holding such shares. If the lender for such loan were to foreclose on the entities holding such shares and sell such shares into the market, it could result in (i) a decrease of the market price of the outstanding share of Class A stock, (ii) an increase volatility in the market price of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and (iii) a change in control of the Company. Our Third Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (\"Articles of Incorporation\") allow trusts and entities affiliated with Messrs. Max Fuller and Eric Fuller and Ms. Pate to pledge shares of Class B common stock without automatic conversion to Class A common stock, in addition to their ability to pledge shares of Class B common stock individually without automatic conversion to Class A common stock. Accordingly, to the extent allowed by our Executive and Director Stock Ownership, Retention, and Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy, all shares of Class B common stock are eligible for pledging.\nProvisions in our charter documents or Nevada law may inhibit a takeover, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws (\"Bylaws\"), and Nevada corporate law contain provisions that could delay, discourage or prevent a change of control or changes in our Board of Directors or management that a stockholder might consider favorable. For example, our Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights, preferences and other terms thereof, including voting rights of those shares; our Articles of Incorporation do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors; our Class B common stock possesses disproportionate voting rights; and our Bylaws provide that a stockholder must provide advance notice of business to be brought before an annual meeting or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of stockholders. These provisions will apply even if the change may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders, and thereby negatively affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A common stock. In addition, to the extent that these provisions discourage an acquisition of our company or other change in control transaction, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares of our Class A common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock.\nDuring the course of preparing for our IPO, we identified four material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. As of December 31, 2019, we remediated all but one material weakness, which was related to a failure to maintain an effective control environment as a result of key information technology general controls being implemented in the quarter ending December 31, 2019, which did not allow an ample instances of control operations to determine operational effectiveness. This material weakness was remediated as of December 31, 2020.\nIf we identify future material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, or if we are unable to comply with the demands that have been placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in a timely manner, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within\nthe timeframes required by the SEC. We also could become subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In addition, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we may face restricted access to the capital markets and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nCOVID-19 RISKS\nWe could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks.\nCertain of our operations and personnel at our headquarters in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and other locations have already been working remotely, which could disrupt our management, business, finance, and financial reporting teams, and which could intensify over time. We have experienced absences and terminations among our driver and non-driver personnel due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Further, our operations, particularly in areas of increased COVID-19 infections, could be disrupted. Negative financial results, operational disruptions, driver and non-driver absences, uncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, other similar outbreaks, or a recession, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, reduce credit options available to us, make it more difficult to obtain amendments, extensions, and waivers, and adversely impact our ability to effectively meet our short- and long-term obligations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The current outbreak has caused a slowdown in the global economy and the duration of the contraction remains uncertain. Risks related to a slowdown or recession are described in our risk factor titled \u201cOur business is subject to economic, business and regulatory factors affecting the truckload industry that are largely beyond our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\u201d\nDevelopments related to COVID-19 have been unpredictable and the extent to which further developments could impact our operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain. Such developments may include the duration of the virus, the distribution and availability of vaccines, the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak.", "PERMNO": 81021, "SIC": 4210, "TIC": "USX"}
