If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we consider immaterial based on information currently available to us may also materially adversely affect us.\nAlmost all of the value of our production and reserves is concentrated in a single block offshore Gabon, and any production problems or reductions in reserve estimates related to this property would adversely impact our business.\nThe Etame field consisting of three producing wells, the Avouma/South Tchibala fields consisting of three wells, and the Ebouri field with one producing well constituted approximately 97% of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, at December 31, 2014, 97% of our total net proved reserves were attributable to these fields. If mechanical problems, storms or other events curtailed a substantial portion of this production, or if the actual reserves associated with this producing property are less than our estimated reserves, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we discovered the presence of H2S from two of our producing wells in the Ebouri field in 2012 and one in the Etame field in 2014. At year end 2014 we intended to, and we still may, build a processing facility capable of removing H2S from production in order to re-establish and maximize production from the impacted areas. However, subsequent to 2014 year end, as a result of the substantial recent fall in oil prices, we are considering more cost efficient options, and there can be no assurances that the processing facility will be completed by 2017, if at all, or that a more cost effective facility will re-establish production to all affected wells in the Ebouri and Etame fields. A determination to not build the processing facility in order to re-establish production or to build a more cost effective facility that does not re-establish all production from affected wells could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves in these fields as unproved reserves.\nOil and natural gas prices are highly volatile, and continued depressed prices will negatively affect our financial results.\nOur revenues, cash flow, profitability, oil and natural gas reserves value and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Our ability to borrow funds and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also substantially dependent on oil and natural gas prices. Historically, world-wide oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile, and may continue to be volatile in the future. In particular, the prices of oil and natural gas were highly volatile in 2014 and declined dramatically in the second half of the year. For example, during 2014, based on NYMEX pricing, the price for a barrel (bbl) of oil ranged from a high of $107.26 to a low of $53.27 and the price for an Mmbtu of natural gas ranged from a high of $8.15 to a low of $2.74.\nContinued depressed oil and natural gas prices or any other unfavorable market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and on the carrying value of our proved reserves. The average price at which we sold in 2014 was $93.66 per barrel compared to $108.35 per barrel in 2013, and $111.06 per barrel in 2012. Because the oil price we are required to use by Security and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) to estimate our future net cash flows is the average price over the 12 months prior to the date of determination of future net cash flows, the full effect of falling prices may not be reflected in our estimated net cash flows for several quarters. We review the carrying value of our properties on a quarterly basis and once incurred, a write-down in the carrying value of our properties is not reversible at a later date, even if prices increase.\nPrices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, increases in supplies from US shale production, international political conditions, including recent uprisings and political unrest in the Middle East and Africa, the European sovereign debt crisis, the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer demand due to slowing economic growth in China and continued weak economic growth in Europe, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the health of international economic and credit markets, the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other state-controlled oil companies to agree upon and maintain oil price and production controls, and general economic conditions. In addition, various factors, including the effect of federal, state and foreign regulation of production and transportation, general economic conditions, changes in supply due to drilling by other producers and changes in demand may adversely affect our ability to market our oil and natural gas production. Any significant decline in the price of oil or natural gas would adversely affect our revenues, operating income, cash flows and borrowing capacity and may require a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and our planned level of capital expenditures including the development of the H2S processing facility.\nIncreases in oil supplies from US shale production, coupled with slower economic growth in economies around the world and a decision by OPEC not to cut production to support higher oil prices, has led to a dramatic reduction in oil prices. While this fall in oil prices may escalate global economic growth rates, thereby increasing demand for oil supplies, the decline in oil prices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe increase in world oil supplies being produced, due to increased US shale production and OPEC\u2019s decision not to reduce production to support higher oil prices, occurring at the same time as reduced economic activity associated with slower economic growth in China, Europe and other global economies has reduced the demand for, and the prices we receive for, our oil and natural gas production. A sustained reduction in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the borrowing base under our credit facility. A reduction in the borrowing base (e.g., a reduction in the estimated value of our assets) under our credit facility could mean a reduction in the capital available for investment in our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities in 2015 and could require mandatory loan repayment obligations under our credit facility.\nThe development plan for our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer, require higher levels of capital expenditures or be revised by us in a manner other than we currently plan due to factors beyond our control, which may require that we re-classify proved undeveloped reserves to an unproved category.\nApproximately 60% of our total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2014, were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations or successful construction of production facilities to treat H2S produced along with oil. Subsequent to 2014 year end, as a result of the substantial recent fall in oil prices, we are considering reductions in our capital expenditures in connection with the processing facility, and there can be no assurances that the processing facility will be completed by 2017, if at all or that a more cost effective facility will re-establish production to all affected wells in the Ebouri and Etame fields. The reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. In addition, delays in the development of reserves or a determination by us to not build and install the processing facility in order to re-establish production in the Ebouri and Etame fields could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses, if not corrected, could affect the reliability of our financial statements and have other adverse consequences.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on internal control over financial reporting. This report must contain, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management. In addition, the report must contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on management's assessment of such internal control over financial reporting.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, as disclosed in \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d. Failure to have effective internal controls could lead to a misstatement of our financial statements or prevent us from filing our financial statements in a timely manner. If, as a result of deficiencies in our internal controls, we cannot provide reliable financial statements, our business decision processes may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the price of our common shares could decrease and our ability to obtain additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be adversely affected. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nWe intend to take further action to remediate the material weaknesses and improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, we can give no assurances that the measures we may take will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nUnless we are able to replace reserves which we have produced, our cash flows and production will decrease over time.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our estimated net proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are produced. There can be no assurance that our planned development and exploration projects and acquisition activities will result in significant additional reserves or that we will have continuing success drilling productive wells at economic finding costs. The drilling of oil and natural gas wells involves a high degree of risk, especially the risk of dry holes or of wells that are not sufficiently productive to provide an economic return on the capital expended to drill the wells. In addition, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including title problems, weather conditions, political instability, availability of capital, economic/currency imbalances, compliance with governmental requirements, receipt of additional seismic data or the reprocessing of existing data, material changes in oil or natural gas prices, prolonged periods of historically low oil and natural gas prices, failure of wells drilled in similar formations or delays in the delivery of equipment and availability of drilling rigs. Certain domestic oil and natural gas producing properties, as well as our Equatorial Guinea property are operated by third parties and, as a result, we have limited control over the nature and timing of exploration and development of such properties or the manner in which operations are conducted on such properties.\nOur results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and compliance with debt covenants could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk from our foreign operations. While oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, portions of our operating costs in Gabon are denominated in the local currency. A weakening U.S. dollar will have the effect of increasing operating costs while a strengthening U.S. dollar will have the effect of reducing operating costs. The Gabon local currency is tied to the Euro. The exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated widely in recent years in response to international political conditions, general economic conditions, the European sovereign debt crisis and other factors beyond our control. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and compliance with debt covenants could be adversely affected by such fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, we entered into a credit facility in the first quarter of 2014 that includes financial covenants which could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates. Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude us from borrowing under our revolving credit facility and require us to immediately pay down any outstanding drawn amounts under the credit agreement, which could affect cash flows or restrict business. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our credit facility.\nSubstantial capital, which may not be available to us in the future, is required to replace and grow reserves.\nWe make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploitation, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations, debt, asset sales, and private sales of equity. During 2014, we participated, and in 2015, we expect to continue to participate, in the further exploration and development projects on our international properties. In Gabon and Angola, we are the operator of the blocks and are thus responsible for contracting on behalf of all the remaining parties participating in the project. We rely on the timely payment of cash calls by our partners to pay for 69.95% of the offshore Gabon block budget, 50% of the onshore Gabon block budget and 50% of the offshore Angola block budget. The continued economic health of our partners could be adversely affected by low oil prices thereby adversely affecting their ability to make timely payment of cash calls.\nHowever, if lower oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties or declines in reserves result in our revenues being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow funds, or our partners fail to pay their share of project costs, we may have a limited ability to expend the capital necessary to undertake or complete future drilling programs. We cannot assure you that the financing under our credit facility will be available in the future or that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet these requirements.\nOur drilling activities require us to risk significant amounts of capital that may not be recovered.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and cost overruns are common. Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including title problems, weather conditions, equipment failures or\naccidents, elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations, compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and natural gas industry may adversely impact our operations.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production and financial activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners. Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Also, computers control nearly all of the oil and natural gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport our production to market. A cyber-attack directed at oil and natural gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. While we have not experienced significant cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks and resulting losses in the future. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber-attacks.\nOur credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit agreement contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u00b7\nrequiring certain ratios with respect to debt service, field life and loan life coverage and liquidity;\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt;\n\u00b7\nmake distributions or other restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nmake investments;\n\u00b7\nenter into leases;\n\u00b7\nuse the proceeds of loans other than as permitted by the credit agreement;\n\u00b7\nmerge or consolidate or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of our assets;\n\u00b7\nsell properties;\n\u00b7\nagree to limit our ability to grant liens or pay dividends;\n\u00b7\nenter into hedge agreements in excess of agreed limits;\n\u00b7\nreduce certain working interests; and\n\u00b7\nmodify our organizational documents.\nThe restrictions contained in the credit agreement could:\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and\n\u00b7\nadversely affect our ability to finance our operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we believe we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants under our credit facility. Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude us from borrowing under our revolving credit facility and require us to immediately pay down any outstanding drawn amounts under the credit agreement, which could affect cash flows or restrict business.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nAvailability under our revolving credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of $65.0 million. The borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on the value of our oil and\nnatural gas reserves as determined by the lenders under our credit facility, and other factors deemed relevant by our lenders. Recent declines in prices for oil and natural gas may cause our banks to reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding borrowings of $15.0 million which bore a weighted average interest rate of 4.32%. We intend to continue borrowing under our revolving credit facility in the future. However, the credit facility contains a covenant that prevents us from borrowing any amounts that would cause our debt to equity ratio to exceed 60:40. As of December 31, 2014, we estimate that this covenant would restrict our total borrowing capacity to approximately $25.0 million. Additionally, any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of borrowing base redeterminations, or otherwise, may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow. Further if, the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination, we would be required to repay the excess. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWeather, unexpected subsurface conditions and other unforeseen operating hazards may adversely impact our oil and natural gas activities.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, casing collapse, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures and discharges of toxic gases, underground migration and surface spills or mishandling of fracture fluids including chemical additives, the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. Our production facilities are also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision and damage from severe weather conditions. The relatively deep offshore drilling conducted by us overseas involves increased drilling risks of high pressures and mechanical difficulties, including stuck pipe, collapsed casing and separated cable. The impact that any of these risks may have upon us is increased due to the low number of producing properties we own.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks; however, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover any losses or exposure for liability. The occurrence of a significant unfavorable event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we cannot predict whether insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or at all.\nSignificant physical effects of climatic change have the potential to damage our facilities, disrupt our production activities and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn an interpretive guidance on climate change disclosure, the SEC indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our exploration and production operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters in low-lying areas, disruption of our production activities because of climate-related damages to our facilities and our costs of operation potentially arising from such climatic effects, less efficient or non-routine operating practices necessitated by climate effects or increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change. If drought conditions were to occur, our ability to obtain water could be impacted and in turn, our ability to perform hydraulic fracturing operations could be restricted or made more costly.\nWe may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face and operators of prospects in which we participate may not maintain or may fail to obtain adequate insurance.\nOur business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and natural gas, including blowouts, cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property, as well as injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/control of a well, comprehensive general liability, and worker\u2019s compensation and employer\u2019s liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing, and for certain risks, such as political risk, nationalization, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business, such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur reserve information represents estimates that may turn out to be incorrect if the assumptions upon which these estimates are based are inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present values of our reserves.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The estimates included in this document are based on various assumptions required by the SEC, including unescalated prices and costs and capital expenditures subsequent to December 31, 2014, and, therefore, are inherently imprecise indications of future net revenues. Actual future production, revenues, taxes, operating expenses, development expenditures and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of reserves incorporated by reference in this document. Specifically, the estimates for our reserves for the year ended December 31, 2014 included assumptions regarding capital expenditures to build the processing facility to remove H2S and resume production in the Ebouri and Etame fields. Subsequent to 2014 year end, as a result of the substantial recent fall in oil prices, we are considering more cost efficient options, and there can be no assurances that the processing facility will be completed by 2017, if at all, or that a more cost effective facility will re-establish production to all affected wells in the Ebouri and Etame fields. A determination to not build the processing facility in order to re-establish production or to build a more cost effective facility that does not re-establish all production from affected wells could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves in these fields as unproved reserves.\nIn addition, our reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future development, availability of funds to acquire additional reserves, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors. Moreover, the calculation of the estimated present value of the future net revenue using a 10% discount rate as required by the SEC is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our reserves or the oil and natural gas industry in general. It is also possible that reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and future net revenues based on the same available data.\nThe estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with current SEC guidelines, and are not intended to reflect the fair market value of our reserves. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, our reserve estimates are prepared using an average of beginning of month prices received for oil and natural gas for the preceding twelve months. Future reductions in prices below the average calculated for 2014 would result in the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves being reduced.\nA substantial portion of our proved reserves are or will be subject to service contracts, production sharing contracts and other arrangements. The quantity of oil and natural gas that we will ultimately receive under these arrangements will differ based on numerous factors, including the price of oil and natural gas, production rates, production costs, cost recovery provisions and local tax and royalty regimes. Changes in many of these factors do not affect estimates of U.S. reserves in the same way they affect estimates of proved reserves in foreign jurisdictions, or will have a different effect on reserves in foreign countries than in the United States. As a result, proved reserves in foreign jurisdictions may not be comparable to proved reserve estimates in the United States.\nIf oil and natural gas prices remain depressed for extended periods of time, we may be required to take write-downs in the value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nThe estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with current SEC guidelines, and are not intended to reflect the fair market value of our reserves. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, our reserve estimates are prepared using the un-weighted average price received for oil and natural gas based on closing prices on the first day of each month for the preceding twelve months from the date of the report. Prices for oil or gas at their current levels after the severe decline in prices in the second half of 2014 are currently below the average calculated for 2014. Because the undiscounted cash flows and discounted fair value related to the Etame, Ebouri and Southeast Etame/North Tchibala fields were less than the book values for these fields, the Company recorded an impairment of $98.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Sustained lower prices will cause the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves being reduced and which may necessitate further write-downs.\nWe have less control over our foreign investments than domestic investments, and added risk in foreign countries may affect our foreign investments.\nOur international assets and operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including, among other things, the risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, changing political conditions, international monetary fluctuations, currency controls and foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. For example, the Gabonese government has recently audited the accounts of a number of energy companies, including ours, that has led to disputes. The Gabonese government has formed a new oil company that\nmay seek to participate in oil and natural gas projects in a manner that could be dilutive to the interest of current license holders and the Gabonese government is under pressure from the Gabonese labor union to require companies to hire higher percentage of Gabonese citizens. In addition, if a dispute arises with our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of the United States.\nPrivate ownership of oil and natural gas reserves under oil and natural gas leases in the United States differs distinctly from our ownership of foreign oil and natural gas properties. In the foreign countries in which we do business, the state generally retains ownership of the minerals and consequently retains control of, and in many cases participates in, the exploration and production of hydrocarbon reserves. Accordingly, operations outside the United States may be materially affected by host governments through royalty payments, export taxes and regulations, surcharges, value added taxes, production bonuses and other charges.\nAlmost all of our proven reserves are located offshore of the Republic of Gabon. As of December 31, 2014, we carried an investment, before depletion and amortization, of approximately $168.5 million including leasehold and asset retirement obligations on our balance sheet associated with the Etame Marin block. We have operated in Gabon since 1995 and believe we have good relations with the current Gabonese government. However, there can be no assurance that present or future administrations or governmental regulations in Gabon will not materially adversely affect our operations or cash flows.\nWe have received an audit report related to our Etame Marin block operations from the Gabon Taxation Department, and an adverse result of the audit could result in a material liability and adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn October 2014, we received a provisional audit report related to our Etame Marine block operations from the Gabon Taxation Department as part of a special industry-wide audit of business practices and financial transactions in the Republic of Gabon. In November 2014, we responded to the Gabon Taxation Department requesting joint meetings to advance the resolution of this matter and provided a formal reply to the provisional audit report in February 2015. We currently cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential loss, if any, as a result of the audit. The ultimate outcome of the claim and impact cannot be predicted, and an adverse result of the audit could result in a material liability and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by violent acts such as from civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, cross-border violence, war, piracy, or other conflicts that may occur in regions that encompass our operations.\nViolent acts resulting in loss of life, destruction of property, environmental damage and pollution occur around the world. Many incidents are driven by civil, ethnic, religious or economic strife. In addition, the number of incidents attributed to various terrorist organizations has increased significantly. We operate in regions of the world that have experienced such incidents or are in close proximity to areas where violence has occurred.\nWe monitor the economic and political environments of the countries in which we operate. However, we are unable to predict the occurrence of disturbances such as those noted above. In addition, we have limited ability to mitigate their impact.\nCivil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, war, or conflicts, or the threats thereof, could have the following results, among others:\n\u00b7\nvolatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates, which could reduce demand for our products;\n\u00b7\nnegative impact on the world crude oil supply if infrastructure or transportation are disrupted, leading to further commodity price volatility;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to work in areas with potential for conflict;\n\u00b7\ninability of our personnel or supplies to enter or exit the countries where we are conducting operations;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of our operations due to evacuation of personnel;\n\u00b7\ninability to deliver our production due to disruption or closing of transportation routes;\n\u00b7\nreduced ability to export our production due to efforts of countries to conserve domestic resources;\n\u00b7\ndamage to or destruction of our wells, production facilities, receiving terminals or other operating assets;\n\u00b7\ndamage to or destruction of property belonging to our commodity purchasers leading to interruption of deliveries, claims of force majeure, and/or termination of commodity sales contracts, resulting in a reduction in our revenues;\n\u00b7\ninability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations resulting in a halt or delay in our planned exploration activities, delayed development of major projects, or shut-in of producing fields;\n\u00b7\nlack of availability of drilling rig, oilfield equipment or services if third party providers decide to exit the region;\n\u00b7\nshutdown of a financial system, communications network, or power grid causing a disruption to our business activities; and\n\u00b7\ncapital market reassessment of risk and reduction of available capital making it more difficult for us and our partners to obtain financing for potential development projects.\nLoss of property and/or interruption of our business plans resulting from civil unrest could have a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow. In addition, we may not have enough insurance to cover any loss of property or other claims resulting from these risks.\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive. We compete with, and may be outbid by, competitors in our attempts to acquire exploration and production rights in oil and natural gas properties. These properties include exploration prospects as well as properties with proved reserves. There is also competition for contracting for drilling equipment and the hiring of experienced personnel. Factors that affect our ability to compete in the marketplace include:\n\u00b7\nour access to the capital necessary to drill wells and acquire properties;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire and analyze seismic, geological and other information relating to a property;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain and hire the personnel necessary to properly evaluate seismic and other information relating to a property;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain and hire experienced personnel, especially for our engineering, geoscience and accounting departments;\n\u00b7\nthe location of, and our ability to access, platforms, pipelines and other facilities used to produce and transport oil and natural gas production; and\n\u00b7\nthe standards we establish for the minimum projected return on an investment of our capital.\nOur competitors include major integrated oil companies and substantial independent energy companies, many of which possess greater financial, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or human resources permit, and be better able than we are to continue drilling during periods of low oil and natural gas prices, to contract for drilling equipment and to secure trained personnel. Our competitors may also use superior technology which we may be unable to afford or which would require costly investment by us in order to compete.\nThe distressed financial conditions of customers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these customers are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide.\nSome of our customers may experience, as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices in 2014 and in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. We cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, future results of operations or future cash flows. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers, or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. In addition, such events might force such customers to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to integrate successfully the operations of any acquisitions with our operations and we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of the recent acquisitions or any future acquisition.\nFailure to successfully assimilate any acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. If we consummate any future\nacquisition, our capitalization and results of operation may change significantly, and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\nProperties that we buy may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities, which could result in material liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOne of our growth strategies is to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions of oil and natural gas reserves. Any future acquisition will require an assessment of recoverable reserves, title, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental hazards, potential tax and ERISA liabilities, and other liabilities and similar factors. Ordinarily, our review efforts are focused on the higher valued properties and are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to review in depth every potential liability on each individual property involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and potential problems, such as ground water contamination and other environmental conditions and deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Any unidentified problems could result in material liabilities and costs that negatively impact our financial condition.\nAdditional potential risks related to acquisitions include, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincorrect assumptions regarding the future prices of oil and natural gas or the future operating or development costs of properties acquired;\n\u00b7\nthe risk that oil and natural gas reserves acquired may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired business, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of liabilities;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nlosses of key employees at the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\noperating a significantly larger combined organization and adding operations;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to realize expected profitability or growth;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings; and\n\u00b7\ncoordinating or consolidating corporate and administrative functions.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly.\nCompliance with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact production.\nThe laws and regulations of the United States, Gabon, Angola and Equatorial Guinea regulate our current business. Our operations could result in liability for personal injuries, property damage, natural resource damages, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and the issuance of orders enjoining operations. In addition, we could be liable for environmental damages caused by, among others, previous property owners or operators of properties that we purchase or lease. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities and may be required to incur substantial remediation costs. We could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change and greenhouse gases and use of hydraulic fracturing fluids, resulting in increased operating costs. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, more stringent GHG regulation could impact demand for oil and natural gas.\nThese laws and governmental regulations, which cover matters including drilling operations, taxation and environmental protection, may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions and could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, no assurances can be given that we will be able to continue to comply with such environmental laws and regulations without incurring substantial costs.\nIf our assumptions underlying accruals for abandonment costs are too low, we could be required to expend greater amounts than expected.\nAlmost all of our producing properties are located offshore. The costs to abandon offshore wells may be substantial. For financial accounting purposes, we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred by capitalizing it as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. No assurances can be given that such reserves will be sufficient to cover such costs in the future as they are incurred.\nAs part of securing the first of two five-year extensions in 2011 to the Etame field production license to which the Company is entitled from the government of Gabon, the Company agreed to a cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of all offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin Block. The agreement was finalized in the first quarter of 2014 (effective 2011) providing for annual funding over the remaining life of the production license. The amounts paid will be reimbursed through the cost account and are non-refundable to the Company. The initial funding took place in October 2014 for calendar years 2012 and 2013 totaling $8.4 million ($2.3 million net to the Company). The funding for calendar year 2014 was paid in the first quarter of 2015 in the amount of $4.2 million ($1.2 million net to the Company). As in prior periods, the obligation for abandonment of the Gabon offshore facilities is included in the asset retirement obligation shown on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. The cash funding is reflected under other long term assets as \u201cAbandonment Funding\u201d.\nFrom time to time we may hedge a portion of our production, which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and natural gas.\nWe may reduce our exposure to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices by hedging a portion of our production. Hedging also prevents us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or natural gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the hedge agreement. Conversely, hedging may limit our ability to realize cash flows from commodity price increases. In a typical hedge transaction, we have the right to receive from the hedge counterparty the excess of the maximum fixed price specified in the hedge agreement over a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the maximum fixed price, we must pay the counterparty this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged even if we had insufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge agreement. Accordingly, if we have less production than we have hedged when the floating price exceeds the fixed price, we must make payments against which there are no offsetting sales of production. If these payments become too large, the remainder of our business may be adversely affected.\nThe distressed financial conditions of one or more hedge providers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these hedge providers are unable to pay us amounts owed to us under one or more financial hedge transactions by which we have hedged our exposure to commodity price volatility.\nFrom time to time, we enter into financial hedge transactions to hedge or mitigate our exposure to the risks of commodity price volatility with respect to the crude oil or natural gas we produce and sell. Similarly, some credit agreement facilities will require that we enter into financial hedges with creditworthy hedge providers for a percentage of our anticipated oil and natural gas production in order to ensure that we are able to make debt service payments under such credit facilities if oil and natural gas prices fall. In such instances, the hedge provider will be obligated to make payments to us under such financial hedge transactions to the extent that the floating (market) price is below an agreed fixed (strike) price. During periods of falling commodity prices, including the recent severe decline in oil and natural gas prices, some of our hedge providers may experience, in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. We cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed hedge providers will not default on their obligations to make a payment owed to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and future results of operations or future cash flows. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities. In addition, such events might force such hedge providers to reduce or curtail their future level of financial hedge availability (liquidity) to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and could have a material adverse effect on one or more of our credit agreement facilities. In addition, hedging agreements expose us to risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations. This risk of counterparty performance is of particular concern given the disruptions that have occurred in the financial markets that led to sudden changes in counterparty\u2019s liquidity and hence their ability to perform under their hedging contracts with us. We are unable to predict sudden changes in counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market\nconditions. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.\nThe adoption of derivatives legislation by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to use financial derivative instruments to reduce (hedge, manage or mitigate) the effect of commodity price, interest rate, and other cost volatilities associated with its business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), signed into law in 2010, establishes, among other provisions, federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives markets and entities, such as us, that participate in those markets. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation; although the CFTC and the SEC have issued final regulations in certain areas, final rules in other areas and the scope of relevant definitions and/or exemptions still remain to be finalized. In one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued on November 5, 2013, a proposed rule imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain specified types of hedging transactions are exempt from these position limits, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions or positions. Similarly, the CFTC has issued a proposed rule on Margin requirements, which proposes to exempt commercial end-users entering into uncleared swaps in order to hedge commercial risks affecting their business from any requirement to post margin to secure their swap transactions that are hedging commercial risks. In addition, the CFTC has issued a final rule authorizing an exception for commercial end-users using swaps to hedge their commercial risks from the otherwise applicable mandatory obligation under the Dodd-Frank Act to clear all swap transactions through a derivatives clearing organization and to trade all such swaps on an exchange. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes recordkeeping and reporting obligations on counterparties to swap transactions and other regulatory compliance obligations. All of the above regulations could increase the costs to us of entering into financial derivative transactions to hedge or mitigate our exposure to commodity price volatility and other commercial risks affecting our business.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will issue final rules applicable to position limits or margin requirements, depending on our ability to satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for a commercial end-user using swaps to hedge or mitigate our commercial risks, these rules and regulations may require us to comply with position limits, margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our financial derivative activities. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require our current counterparties to financial derivative transactions to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties, and may cause some entities to cease their current business as hedge providers. These changes could reduce the liquidity of the financial derivatives markets thereby reducing the ability of commercial end-users to have access to financial derivatives to hedge or mitigate their exposure to commodity price volatility. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available capital for other commercial operations purposes), materially alter the terms of future swaps relative to the terms of our existing bilaterally negotiated financial derivative contracts, and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against commercial risks we encounter.\nFinally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks and on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to oil and natural gas production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn recent years, the current U.S. government\u2019s budget proposals and other proposed legislation have included the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production. If enacted into law, these proposals would eliminate certain tax preferences applicable to taxpayers engaged in the exploration or production of natural resources. These changes include, but are not limited to (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for U.S. production activities and (iv) the increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the exploration for or development of, oil and natural gas within the United States. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes would become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our senior management team and the loss of a single member could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon our executive officers and key employees. The unexpected loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties and developing and executing financing and hedging strategies. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees.\nWe rely on a single purchaser of our Gabon production, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEffective January 2011, we sold all of our crude oil production in Gabon to Mercuria, and the contract with Mercuria was extended through the first quarter of 2014. In Gabon, starting in the second quarter of 2014, the Company switched to an agency model to sell its crude oil. The Company contracted with a third party in order to sell, based on a fixed barrel fee, on the spot market. For the first quarter of 2015, the Company will also sell its oil under the agency model on the spot market.\nThe marketability of our production in Texas is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control.\nThe marketability of our production from Texas depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. We deliver crude oil and natural gas produced from these areas through gathering systems and pipelines, some of which we do not own. The lack of availability of capacity on third-party systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, including adverse weather conditions. Activist or other efforts may delay or halt the construction of additional pipelines or facilities.\nThird-party systems and facilities may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could delay production, thereby harming our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the price and terms for access to pipeline transportation in the U.S. remain subject to extensive federal and state regulation. If these regulations change, or if rate increase requests are approved, we could face higher transmission costs for our production and, possibly, reduced access to transmission capacity. Various proposals and proceedings that might affect the petroleum industry are pending before Congress, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, various state legislatures, and the courts. The industry historically has been heavily regulated and we cannot provide assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue nor can we predict what effect such proposals or proceedings may have on our operations.\nFederal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions but is not subject to regulation at the federal level (except for fracturing activity involving the use of diesel). The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. A committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. In past sessions, legislation was introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states and local jurisdictions including Texas, where we operate, have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, New York recently has announced that it will impose a ban on high-volume hydraulic fracturing. Further, Pennsylvania has adopted a variety of regulations limiting how and where fracturing can be performed. Any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable. Further, the EPA has announced an initiative under TSCA to develop regulations governing the disclosure and evaluation of hydraulic fracturing chemicals and is working on regulations to address wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations. If hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such federal or state legislation could require the disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process to state or federal regulatory authorities\nwho could then make such information publicly available. In addition, restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities.\nAdditionally, a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud that could seriously harm our business may occur and not be detected.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, an evaluation of controls can only provide reasonable assurance that all material control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect error or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 78841, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EGY"}
