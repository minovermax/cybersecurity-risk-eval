RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to other information included in this annual report, in evaluating NF Energy Saving Corporation and our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur losses in 2018 and need to refinance our outstanding debt raise doubt as to whether we can continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $6.4 million and a working capital deficit of $10.5 million. These factors among others indicate that we may be unable to continue as a going concern, particularly in the event that we cannot generate revenues, obtain additional financing and/or obtain profitable operations. As such, there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if we cannot continue as a going concern, your investment in us could become devalued or worthless.\nWe have had a history of losses and our future levels of sales and ability to achieve profitability are unpredictable.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $6.4 million and net loss of approximately $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the comparable periods, we had a net loss of $1,578,000 in 2017, $1,818,000 in 2016, $969,400 in 2015, and $617,300 in 2014. Our ability to maintain and improve future levels of sales and profitability depends on many factors, which include:\n\u2022 delivering products in a timely manner;\n\u2022 successfully implementing our business strategy;\n\u2022 increased demand for existing products; and\n\u2022 controlling costs.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our challenges and continue to be profitable in the future or that the level of historic sales will continue in the future.\nWe are undertaking a large number of business initiatives at the same time, including exploring opportunities to expand into the healthcare industry in China. If these initiatives are not successful, they may have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe are undertaking a large number of new business initiatives at the same time in order to support our future growth. For example, we expect that our acquisition of Boqi Pharmacy will close later in 2019. Boqi Pharmacy is engaged in retailing medical products through its pharmacy chain stores which is different from our traditional operations and such operations may expose us to operational risks. There can be no assurance that we will successfully scale Boqi Pharmacy, or that our offerings will be attractive to consumers in our market.\nFurthermore, we can provide no assurances that we will be successful in our new business initiatives. In addition, developing and testing new and multiple business opportunities and strategies often requires knowledge in areas of expertise that may be new to our organization and may require significant time of our management and resources. For example, Boqi Pharmacy extends our business into an area where we have had limited historical operating and management experience and where low margins and high customer expectations can put pressure on results and performance.\nExpanding our business will also require that we develop management expertise in new markets and regulatory regimes, and an inability to adapt our business quickly and efficiently to support our international expansion could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We can provide no assurances that we will be successful in expanding our operations into any new businesses and product lines.\nAny new businesses we enter may also expose us to additional laws, regulations and risks, including the risk that we may incur ongoing operating expenses in such businesses in excess of revenues, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. The financial profile of any such new businesses may be different than our current financial profile, which could affect our financial performance and the market price for our common stock.\nWe may incur significant costs for any new initiative before we realize any corresponding revenue with respect to such initiative. In addition, we may incur costs as we revise, restructure or discontinue existing product categories or business offerings in favor of pursuing new initiatives or retail concepts. The introduction of excellent and new assets requires significant investments by us and outside investors, and we anticipate that will experience some painful period. To the extent that these new business opportunities do not generate sufficient revenue to recoup the cost of developing and operating such new concepts, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we are continuing a number of new initiatives to improve the operations of our business, including ongoing refinements to our management structure and organizational design. Some of the improvements we are pursuing include simplifying the management structure and optimizing the organizational design will affect our financial results from quarter to quarter.\nGiven the large number of organizational initiatives we are pursuing, as well as the complexity and untested nature of many of these efforts, there can be no certainty that we will be successful in executing on these initiatives including changes to our organizational design and management structure. We may not experience the operational or financial benefits we expect these improvements to generate and we may face unanticipated costs related to pursuing these initiatives such as personnel turnover, management distraction, or compliance and quality control risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAll of the foregoing risks may be compounded due to various factors including the economic downturn in China. If we fail to achieve the intended results of our current business initiatives, or if the implementation of these initiatives is delayed or abandoned, diverts management\u2019s attention or resources from other aspects of our business or costs more than anticipated (including, as a result of personnel turnover or compliance and control risks), we may experience inadequate return on investment for some or all such business initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have experienced significant fluctuations in our business during the last several years, and high levels of growth may not be achieved in future periods and may not generate a corresponding improvement in our results of operations.\nWe have experienced significant fluctuations in the growth rate of our business during the last several years. We may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarter-to-quarter performance, not only because the rate of sales growth\nin some quarters may be slower than in prior periods but also because we may experience some quarters that have growth rates that are higher than prior periods. We are currently engaged in a number of initiatives to support the growth and expansion of our business.\nWhile we anticipate that these initiatives will support the growth of our business, costs and timing issues associated with pursuing these initiatives can negatively affect our gross margins in the short term and may amplify fluctuations in our growth rate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing and extent of our realization of the costs and benefits of such initiatives.\nThere can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that we will not encounter other operational difficulties that may have a material negative impact on growth and profitability. In addition, these initiatives may have near-term material negative impacts on growth and profitability as we incur costs or pursue strategies that may not contribute to our profits and margins until future periods, if at all.\nSome factors affecting our business, including macroeconomic conditions and policies and changes in legislation, are not within our control. In prior periods, our results of operations have been adversely affected by weakness in the overall economic environment in China.\nIn addition, our rates of revenue growth and comparable brand revenue growth have sharply fluctuated from quarter to quarter over the last three years and we expect volatility in the rates of our growth to continue in future quarterly periods. Unique factors in any given quarter may affect period-to-period comparisons in our revenue and comparable brand revenue growth, including;\n\u2022 the overall economic and general retail sales environment, including the effects of uncertainty or stock market volatility on consumer spending;\n\u2022 our ability to collect our accounts receivable;\n\u2022 consumer preferences and demand;\n\u2022 our ability to efficiently source and distribute products;\n\u2022 changes in our product offerings and the introduction, and timing thereof, of introduction of new products and new product categories; and\n\u2022 our competitors introducing similar products.\nDue to these factors, our results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year. Our results of operations may also vary relative to corresponding periods in prior years. We may take certain pricing, merchandising or marketing actions that could have a disproportionate effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in a particular quarter or selling season, and as a result we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nOther future developments in our business could also result in material changes in our operating costs. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in offsetting any such expenses with increased efficiency or that cost increases associated with our business will not have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt obligations. If we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may need to renegotiate or refinance our debt, obtain additional financing, postpone capital expenditures or sell assets.\nWe depend mainly on cash generated by continuing operating activities to make payments on our debt. We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make the scheduled payments on our debt. Our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on whether we can successfully implement our business strategy, as well as on economic, financial, competitive and technical factors.\nSome of the factors are beyond our control, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate or intend to operate, changes in our customers\u2019 demand for products that we sell, and pressure from existing and new competitors. Also, because certain of our loans bear interest at floating rates, we are susceptible to an increase in interest rates.\nIf we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations, we may need to renegotiate the terms of our debt, refinance our debt, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or sell assets.\nIf our lenders decline to renegotiate the terms of our debt in these circumstances, the lenders could declare all amounts borrowed and all amounts due to them under the agreements due and payable.\nOur debt obligations may hinder our growth and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur debt obligations require us to use a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to repay the principal and interest on our loans. This reduces funds available to grow and expand our business, limits our ability to pursue business opportunities and makes us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns. The existence of debt obligations and covenants also limits our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms.\nDue to restrictions in our loan agreements, we may not be able to operate our business as we desire.\nOur loan agreements contain a number of conditions and limitations on the way in which we can operate our business, including limitations on our ability to raise debt, sell or acquire assets.\nThe restrictions in our loan agreements may force us to pursue less than optimal business strategies or forgo business arrangements, which could have been financially advantageous to our shareholders and us. Our failure to comply with the restrictions contained in our loan agreements could lead to a default under the terms of these agreements.\nWe may expand our business through acquisitions that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses. This could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn April 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire Boqi Pharmacy. We may expand our services through additional acquisitions. The negotiation of acquisitions, investments or joint ventures, as well as the integration of acquired or jointly developed businesses, could divert our management\u2019s time and resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consume this acquisition or successfully integrate and manage future acquisitions, if they occur.\nFurthermore, once integrated, acquisitions may not achieve comparable levels of revenues, profitability or productivity which existed prior to the acquisitions or otherwise perform as expected. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in achieving the potential benefits of the acquisition of the business operations of Boqi Pharmacy.\nIn April 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Boqi Pharmacy. The transaction is expected to close later in 2019. This acquisition is subject to a variety of risks that could seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and share price. These risks include, among others:\n\u2022 incurrence of unexpected expenses associated with acquisition and integration of the acquired business into our Company;\n\u2022 difficulties in the assimilation and integration of the acquired operations, personnel, technologies, products, and information systems;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022 contractual disputes;\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022 incompatible business cultures;\n\u2022 difficulties in implementing and maintaining uniform standards, controls and policies;\n\u2022 the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new personnel; and\n\u2022 potential inability to retain, integrate and motivate key management, marketing, technical sales and customer support personnel.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain financing in the future to support our operations and expansion.\nHaving access to sufficient operating funds and capital funds for expansion will affect our ability to execute our business plan. We finance our business mainly through internally generated funds, short-term bank loans and, from time to time, selling equity securities to raise additional capital. There is no guarantee that we will always have internal funds available for our future development or that we will be able to raise capital from investor financing and loans granted by investors and financial institutions in the future. In addition, there may be delays in the process of selling our securities, which may require us to cut back on our operations or expansion activities. Our access to debt or equity financing depends on the investors\u2019 and banks\u2019 willingness to lend to and invest in us, our financial condition and on general conditions in the capital markets. We may not be able to secure additional sources of financing on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Any shortfall in our cash flow and capital needs may result in our having to curtail our business plans or have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe believe that we need to raise additional capital for the expansionary elements of our business plan, which financing may not be available or available on terms favorable to us.\nWe will need to raise additional capital from outside sources for the purchase of Boqi Pharmacy and other anticipated acquisitions. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. One possible impediment to raising capital is the tightening credit policies of the Chinese banks and the continued effects of tightening in the global credit markets. If we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products or services, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. We cannot be sure that we will be able to secure all the financing we will require, or that it will be available on favorable terms. If we are unable to obtain any necessary additional financing, we will be required to substantially curtail our approach to implementing our business objectives. Additional financing may be debt, equity or a combination of debt and equity. If equity is used, it could result in significant dilution to our shareholders.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be classified as a passive foreign investment company (a \u201cPFIC\u201d).\nBased upon our current and projected income, assets and activities, there can be no assurance that we will not be classified as such in the future. Such classification may have materially adverse tax consequences for our U.S. shareholders. One method of avoiding such tax consequences is by making a \u201cqualified electing fund\u201d election for the first taxable year in which the Company is a PFIC. However, such an election is conditioned upon our furnishing our U.S. shareholders annually with certain tax information. We do not presently prepare or provide such information, and such information may not be available to our U.S. shareholders if we are subsequently determined to be a PFIC. You are advised to consult with your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax consequences related to the ownership and disposition of our Ordinary Shares under your own particular factual circumstances.\nWe are subject to the risks of any growing enterprise, any one of which could limit our growth and our product and market development.\nOur operating history makes it difficult to predict how our businesses will develop and where the Company will find success. This is especially true in respect of our expansion into areas other than flow valve technology and their design, sales and installation. Accordingly, we face all of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies in similar stages of development, such as: (i) uncertain and continued market acceptance for our product extensions and our services; (ii) the evolving nature of the wind energy equipment industry in the PRC, where significant consolidation may occur, leading to the formation of companies which may be better able to compete with us than is currently the case; (iii) the fragmented nature of the boiler and furnace business which may limit our ability to\npenetrate the market and provide comprehensive solutions on a sufficiently wide basis to make the business profitable; (iv) changing competitive conditions, technological advances or customer preferences could adversely affect the sales of our products or services; (v) maintaining our competitive position in the PRC and competing with Chinese and international companies, many of which have longer operating histories and greater financial resources than us; (vi) continuing to offer commercially successful products to attract and retain a larger base of direct customers and ultimate users; (vii) maintaining effective control of our costs and expenses; and (viii) retaining our management and skilled technical staff and recruiting additional key employees.\nIf we are not able to meet the challenges of building our businesses and managing our growth, the likely result will be slower growth, lower margins, additional operational costs and lower income.\nEfforts to protect our intellectual property rights and to defend against claims against us can increase our costs and will not always succeed. Any failures could adversely affect our sales and results of operations or restrict our ability to conduct our business.\nIntellectual property rights are important to many aspects of our business. We actively pursue patent protection in our flow valve business, and we expect to pursue intellectual property rights in our other business endeavors as we develop unique solutions to business demands. We, however, may be unable to obtain protection for our intellectual property. Even if protection is obtained, competitors may raise legal challenges to our rights or illegally infringe on our rights, including through means that may be difficult to prevent, detect or defend. In addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change and the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions, competitors may be issued patents from applications that were unknown to us prior to issuance. The patents of others could reduce the value of our commercial or pipeline of products or, to the extent they cover key technologies on which we have unknowingly relied, require that we seek to obtain licenses at a financial cost to us or cease using the technology, no matter how valuable the patents may be to our business. We cannot assure you we would be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms. Also, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of our and the proprietary rights of others. There is a risk that the outcome of such litigation will not be in our favor. Such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention as well as expend other resources which could otherwise have been devoted to our business. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, prospects and reputation. In addition, we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover such costs from other parties. The occurrence of any of the foregoing may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFinally, implementation of PRC intellectual property-related laws has historically been limited, primarily because of ambiguities in the PRC laws and difficulties in enforcement. Accordingly, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries, which increases the risk that we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nWe derive a substantial part of our revenues from several major customers, therefore if we lose any of these customers or they reduce the amount of business they do with us in the future, our revenues may be affected\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated 60% of our revenues from our top 10 customers. These customers may not maintain the same volume of business with us in the future. If we lose any of these customers or they reduce the amount of business they do with us, our revenues may be materially and adversely affected. Although we have a strategic partnership with our largest customer and a preferred provider agreement with our first largest customer until 2021, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to provide the current level of demand or will not seek to modify or terminate their respective agreements.\nOur technology may not satisfy the changing needs of our customers.\nWith any technology, including the technology of our current and proposed products, there are risks that the technology may not successfully address our customers\u2019 needs. Certain of our product offerings in relation to the wind energy equipment will be new for the Company. While we have already established successful relationships with our customers, their needs may change or vary. This may affect the ability of our present or proposed products to address all of our customers\u2019 ultimate technology needs in an economically feasible manner.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with rapid technological changes and competition in our industry.\nWhile we believe that we have hired or engaged personnel and outside consultants who have the experience and ability necessary to keep pace with advances in technology, and while we continue to seek out and develop \u201cnext generation\u201d technology through our research and development efforts, there is no guarantee that we will be able to keep pace with technological developments and market demands in this evolving industry and market. In addition, our industry is competitive in various aspects. Although we believe that we have developed strategic relationships to best penetrate the Chinese market, we face competition from other manufacturers of products similar to our products and services. Some of these companies have significant advantages over us with respect to their products, marketing and services, and their financial resources and customer relationships.\nWe may experience high accounts receivable balances from time to time, which may have an adverse effect on our operating profitability and cash flow and financing needs.\nIn the past, most of our customers made payments in accordance with the agreed payment terms in a timely manner. However, since late 2018, some of our customers requested extended payment terms and those receivables are now outstanding for over one year. Although some of these customers are large state-owned corporations, in view of current economic situation in China and limited subsequent collections, we determined to accrue significant allowances against those receivables. As of December 31, 2018, we reported $14.7 million of allowances for doubtful accounts. As a result, we will have to obtain outside financing and our operating expenses will increase. Extension of the accounts receivable period may also result in reduced collections, which will adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nTo the extent that we depend on government projects, our business is dependent on government policy and, to some extent, government funding and government contracts.\nAlthough we do not characterize our business as a government contractor, some aspects of our business are indirectly dependent on government policy, government funding, and government contracts. For example, the South to North Water Diversion Project is largely a government funded project, and our customers are contractors with the government. Similarly, our energy-saving projects and adjustments of our products and services are dependent on the policies issued by the government. As a consequence, it is possible that our requirements based on the products and services to be provided will be diminished resulting in a decrease in our revenue. Much of the pollution control and green industries are dependent on government policy to implement societal improvements. Our business has a number of aspects that are dependent on the government and our products, services and revenues are dependent on policies that can change if the government officials determine to redirect attention and investment to other aspects of society and industrial development.\nAdditionally, as a number of our customers are dependent on the government for their revenues through the provision of products and services on government contracts or government funded projects, there may be delays in our receiving payment for our products and services.\nFluctuation in the availability and cost of our raw materials may have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations.\nA portion of the inventory of raw materials and parts may be affected by fluctuations in the availability of the items and the price. Such things may include steel, electronic components, power systems, paints and welding rods. We do not generally have long term supply contracts with our suppliers, but rely on long standing relationships. To the extent that we are not able to obtain the required materials and parts necessary to enable us to fabricate our products, or we are required to pay more for such items, then there could be an adverse effect on our operations and our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our planned growth.\nAs we expand our business into several different areas of energy savings and green industry, we will need to manage our growth effectively, which may entail devising and effectively implementing business plans, training and managing our growing workforce, managing our costs, and implementing adequate control in our reporting systems in a timely manner. We may not be able to successfully manage our growth. Our failure to do so could affect our success in executing our business plan and adversely affect our revenues, profitability and results of operations.\nOur operations are vulnerable to natural disasters or other events.\nOur operating income may be reduced by natural disasters, in locations where we own and/or operate significant manufacturing facilities or are working on significant projects. Some types of losses, such as from earthquake, severe winter storms and environmental hazards, may be either uninsurable or too expensive to justify insuring against. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in any particular property, as well as any anticipated future revenue from such property.\nOur products may contain defects, which could adversely affect our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs.\nDespite numerous testing and quality controls, defects may be found in existing or new products. Any such defects could cause us to incur significant return and exchange costs, re-engineering costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, and cause significant customer relations and business reputation problems. Any such defects could force us to undertake a product recall program, which could cause us to incur significant expenses and could harm our reputation and that of our products. If we deliver products with defects, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be harmed.\nOur business could be subject to environmental liabilities.\nWe use certain hazardous substances in our operations. Currently we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our business, revenues or results of operations, as a result of compliance with Chinese environmental laws and regulations. However, the risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our business, and there is no assurance that material environmental liabilities and compliance charges will not arise in the future.\nWe have limited business insurance coverage in China\nThe insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products. As a result, we do not have any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations in China. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nBecause our funds are held in banks in the PRC that do not provide insurance, the failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could affect our ability to continue in business.\nBanks and other financial institutions in the PRC do not provide insurance for funds held on deposit. A portion of our assets are in the form of cash deposited with banks in the PRC, and in the event of a bank failure, we may not have access to our funds on deposit. Depending upon the amount of money we maintain in a bank that fails, our inability to have access to our cash could impair our operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue in business.\nWe substantially depend on a few key personnel who, if not retained, could cause declines in productivity and operational results and loss of our strategic guidance, all of which would diminish our business prospects and value to investors.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the continued service of a few executive officers and key employees, including, Mr. Yongquan Bi, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees would have an adverse effect on us and our PRC operating subsidiaries, as these individuals play a significant role in developing and executing our overall business plan and maintaining customer relationships and proprietary technology systems. While none of our key personnel is irreplaceable, the loss of the services of any of these individuals would be disruptive to our business. We believe that our overall future success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial and marketing personnel. There is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel on terms acceptable to the Company or the employee. Inadequate personnel will limit our growth, and will be seen as a detriment to our prospects, leading potentially to a loss in value for investors.\nWe are controlled by a small group of our existing stockholders, whose interests may differ from other stockholders.\nOur Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mr. Yongquan Bi, beneficially, together with a group of investors, owns approximately 51% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and is our largest single stockholder. Accordingly these stockholders acting together will have significant influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. They will also have significant influence in preventing or causing a change in control. In addition, without the consent of these stockholders, we may be prevented from entering into certain transactions which may be beneficial to our other stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of the other stockholders.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of proposed Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws\nWe are contemplating adopting provisions to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws that may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that other shareholders might similarly consider in their best interest, including any attempt that might result in receipt of a premium over the market price for stockholders\u2019 shares of common stock. We intend to seek shareholder approval of such amendments in the near future. These provisions may include:\nClassified Board. Such amendments may provide that our board of directors will be divided into three classes of directors, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible. As a result, approximately one third of our board of directors will be elected each year. The classification of directors will have the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may also provide that, subject to any rights of holders of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of directors will be fixed exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by our governing body.\nAction by Written Consent; Special Meetings of Stockholders. Such amendments may provide that stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and cannot be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws may also provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by the Executive Committee (or, if it does not then-exist, the board of directors), the chairman, vice chairman or executive chairman of the board or the chief executive officer, or at the request of holders representing a majority of the total voting power of our issued and outstanding common stock, voting together as a single class. Except as described above, stockholders may not be permitted to call a special meeting or to require the board of directors to call a special meeting.\nWe are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors.\nThe DGCL and our Bylaws provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against costs and expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on our behalf. Consequently, we may be required to expend substantial funds to satisfy these indemnity obligations. Any payment in respect of these indemnification rights could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and our results of operations.\nIf we fail to implement effective internal controls required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or remedy any material weaknesses in our internal controls that we may identify, such failure could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management of public companies to develop and implement internal controls over financial reporting and evaluate the effectiveness thereof. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual interim financial statement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Due to the Company\u2019s limited resources, we currently do not have accounting personnel with extensive experience in maintaining books and records and preparing financial statements in accordance with US GAAP which could lead to untimely identification and resolution of accounting matters inherent in the Company\u2019s financial transactions in accordance with US GAAP.\nAny failure to complete our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting, to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify, including the one identified above, or to implement new or improved controls, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our public disclosures and reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Company\u2019s Common Stock\nTrading volume of our common stock has fluctuated from time to time, which may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares at times and prices that investors feel are appropriate.\nTo date, the trading volume of our common stock has fluctuated. Generally, lower trading volumes adversely effects the liquidity of our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts\u2019 and the media\u2019s coverage of us. This may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock.\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market imposes listing standards on our common stock that we may not be able to fulfill, thereby leading to a possible delisting of our common stock. We are currently facing such risk.\nAs a listed Nasdaq Capital Market company, we are subject to rules covering, among other things, certain major corporate transactions, the composition of our Board of Directors and committees thereof, minimum bid price of our common stock and minimum stockholders\u2019 equity. The failure to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market requirements may result in the de-listing of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market price thereof.\nWe have not timely filed its reports in 2019, including this Form 10-K. On August 16, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from NASDAQ stating that, because the Company\u2019s Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2019 has not been filed, the Company is not in compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s Listing Rules for continued listing. The Company at the time has not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2018 nor Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2019, and the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. The letter reiterates that the Company has been granted an exception until August 30, 2019 to file its delinquent Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2018 and Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2019 and until September 16, 2019, to file its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2019. As a result of the additional delinquency, NASDAQ requested that the Company submit an update to its original plan no later than August 30, 2019 as to how to regain compliance with respect to the filing requirement.\nIf our common stock were to be de-listed, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts\u2019 coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our common stock is de-listed, broker-dealers have certain regulatory requirements imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, further limiting the liquidity thereof. These factors could result in lower prices for shares of our common stock and/or limit an investor\u2019s ability to execute a transaction. In addition delisting from Nasdaq could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could lead to significant dilution to our stockholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions at a price per share significantly below the then market price.\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance.\nThe price for our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products and media reports by us or our competitors, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends\nin our markets or general economic conditions. The volatile price of our stock makes it difficult for investors to predict the value of our investment, to sell shares at a profit at any given time, or to plan purchases and sales in advance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that may have been unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nBecause we have not paid dividends, investors will not realize any income from an investment in our common stock unless and until investors sell their shares at profit.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock in 2018 or 2017, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future. Investors will only realize income on an investment in our stock in the event they sell or otherwise dispose of their shares at a price higher than the price they paid for their shares. Such a gain would result only from an increase in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.\nThe payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including future earnings, the success of our business activities, general financial condition, future prospects, general business conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nRisk Related to Doing Business in China\nAdverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business.\nAll of our business operations are currently conducted in the PRC, under the jurisdiction of the PRC government. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in China. China\u2019s economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, and control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of China. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall PRC economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us.\nOn March 8, 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed a further 25% tariffs, the equivalent of $50 billion on Chinese goods. In response, on April 4, 2018, China released a tariff list of 25% on $50 billion of US imports. The U.S. government imposed a 25% tariff on $50 billion of Chinese imports in July and August 2018, respectively, to be followed by a 10% tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods in September 2018. On August 23, 2019, the U.S. government announced the plan for two tariff increases in retaliation for China\u2019s imposing additional tariffs of 5% to 10% on $75 billion of U.S. imports earlier that day.\nThere is no guarantee that more measures will be introduced, and if these trade policies come into force and the scope of them is further expanded, the volume of China-U.S. import and export trade would drop significantly, which will lead to deterioration in economic conditions of both countries and decrease of business and official activities between both countries.\nUnprecedented rapid economic growth in China may increase our costs of doing business, and may negatively impact our profit margins and/or profitability.\nOur business depends in part upon the availability of relatively low-cost labor and materials. Rising wages in China may increase our overall costs of production. In addition, rising raw material costs, due to strong demand and greater scarcity, may increase our overall costs of production. If we are not able to pass these costs on to our customers in the form of higher prices, our profit margins and/or profitability could decline\nWe may suffer currency exchange losses if the RMB depreciates relative to the US Dollar.\nOur reporting currency is the US Dollar. However, substantially all of our revenues are denominated in RMB. In July 2005, China changed its exchange rate regime by establishing a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. The RMB is no longer officially pegged to the US dollar, and the exchange rate will have some flexibility. Despite fluctuations in the exchange rate in 2016, the floating exchange rate regime is stable. If the RMB depreciates relative to the US Dollar, our revenues as expressed in our US Dollar financial statements will decline in value and if the RMB appreciates relative to the US Dollar, our revenues as expressed in our US Dollar financial statements will increase in value. There are very limited hedging transactions available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, if at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into US Dollars.\nLabor laws in the PRC may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn January 1, 2008, the PRC government promulgated the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, or the New Labor Contract Law. The New Labor Contract Law imposes greater liabilities on employers and significantly impacts the cost of an employer\u2019s decision to reduce its workforce. Further, it requires certain terminations to be based upon seniority and not merit. In the event we decide to significantly change or decrease our workforce, the New Labor Contract Law could adversely affect our ability to enact such changes in a manner that is most advantageous to our business or in a timely and cost effective manner, thus materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive all our revenues in RMB. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from the SAFE or its local branch is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and can be remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions.\nThe PRC legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit the legal protections available to us and you, or could lead to penalties on us.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedential value. In 1979, the PRC Government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past 25 years has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in mainland China. Our PRC operating subsidiary, Nengfa Energy, a wholly foreign-owned enterprises (\u201cWFOEs\u201d), is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in the PRC in general and laws and regulations applicable to WFOEs in particular.\nIt may be difficult to enforce any civil judgments against us or our board of directors or officers, because most of our operating and/or fixed assets are located outside of the United States.\nAlthough we are incorporated in the State of Delaware, all of our operating and fixed assets are located in the PRC. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments outside the United States obtained in actions brought against us in the United States, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or of the securities laws of any state of the United States. In addition, our directors and officers (principally based in the PRC) and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon those directors and officers, or to enforce against them or us judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or of the securities laws of any state of the United States. We have been advised by our PRC counsel that, in their opinion, there\nis doubt as to the enforceability in the PRC, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States or the securities laws of any state of the United States.\nBecause our assets are located overseas, shareholders may not receive distributions that they would otherwise be entitled to if we were declared bankrupt or insolvent.\nBecause all of our assets are located in the PRC, they may be outside of the jurisdiction of U.S. courts to administer if we are the subject of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. As a result, if we declared bankruptcy or insolvency, our shareholders may not receive the distributions on liquidation that they would otherwise be entitled to if our assets were to be located within the U.S., under U.S. Bankruptcy law.", "PERMNO": 12358, "SIC": 3490, "TIC": "BIMI"}
