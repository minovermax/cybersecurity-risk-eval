{"cik": "1382821", "company": "Redfin Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information in this annual report, before investing in any of our securities. The occurrence of any single risk or any combination of risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, liquidity, or competitive position, and consequently, the value of our securities. The material adverse effects include, but are not limited to, not growing our revenue or market share at the pace that they have grown historically or at all, our revenue and market share fluctuating on a quarterly and annual basis, an extension of our history of losses and a failure to become profitable, not achieving the revenue and net income (loss) guidance that we provide, and harm to our reputation and brand.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business depends significantly on the health of the U.S. residential real estate industry and macroeconomic factors.\nOur success depends largely on the health of the U.S. residential real estate industry. This industry, in turn, is affected by changes in general economic conditions, which are beyond our control. Any of the following factors could adversely affect the industry and harm our business:\n\u2022seasonal or cyclical downturns in the U.S. residential real estate industry, which may be due to any single factor, or a combination of factors, listed below, or factors which are currently not known to us or that have not historically affected the industry;\n\u2022slow economic growth or recessionary conditions;\n\u2022increased unemployment rates or stagnant or declining wages;\n\u2022inflationary conditions;\n\u2022low consumer confidence in the economy or the U.S. residential real estate industry;\n\u2022adverse changes in local or regional economic conditions in the markets that we serve, particularly our top-10 markets and markets into which we are attempting to expand;\n\u2022increased mortgage rates; reduced availability of mortgage financing; or increased down payment requirements;\n\u2022low home inventory levels, which may result from zoning regulations and higher construction costs, among other factors;\n\u2022lack of affordably priced homes, which may result from home prices growing faster than wages;\n\u2022volatility and general declines in the stock market or lower yields on individuals' investment portfolios;\n\u2022rising insurance and tax costs that increase the expenses associated with home ownership;\n\u2022newly enacted and potential federal, state, and local legislative actions that would affect the residential real estate industry generally or in our top-10 markets, including (i) actions that would increase the tax liability arising from buying, selling, or owning real estate, (ii) actions that would change the way real estate brokerage commissions are negotiated, calculated, or paid, and (iii) potential reform relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government sponsored entities that provide liquidity to the mortgage market;\n\u2022changes that cause U.S. real estate to be more expensive for foreign purchases, such as (i) increases in the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies and (ii) foreign regulatory changes or capital controls that make it more difficult for foreign purchasers to withdraw capital from their home countries or purchase and hold U.S. real estate;\n\u2022changed generational views on homeownership and generally decreased financial resources available for purchasing homes; and\n\u2022war, terrorism, political uncertainty, natural disasters, inclement weather, health epidemics or pandemics, and acts of God.\nCOVID-19 has affected our business and may continue to affect our business.\nOur success depends on a high volume of residential real estate transactions throughout the markets in which we operate. This transaction volume affects all of the ways that we generate revenue, including our number of real estate services transaction, RedfinNow's ability to sell homes that it owns, the number of loans our mortgage business originates and potentially resells, and the number of deals our title and settlement business closes. COVID-19 has affected, and may continue to affect, residential real estate transaction volume.\nWe believe that COVID-19's impact on our residential real estate transaction volume depends largely on the existence and prevalence of the two factors described below. If one or both of these factors exists to a large extent in the markets in which we operate, our residential real estate transaction volume may significantly decline.\n\u2022Prohibitions or limitations on in-person activities associated with residential real estate transactions, whether imposed (i) by a city, county, or state, government through shelter-in-place, stay-at-home, or similar isolation orders or otherwise or (ii) by us to protect the health of our customers, agents, and communities.\n\u2022Lack of consumer desire for in-person interactions and physical home tours that have historically been important aspects of the homebuying and home selling process.\nAdditionally, we believe that any prolonged economic impacts from COVID-19, including those described below, may also adversely affect residential real estate transaction volume.\n\u2022Increased unemployment rates and stagnant or declining wages.\n\u2022Decreased consumer confidence in the economy and recessionary conditions.\n\u2022Volatility and declines in the stock market and lower yields on individuals' investment portfolios.\n\u2022More stringent mortgage financing conditions, including increased down payment requirements.\nIn addition to the volume of residential real estate transactions, our success also depends on the U.S. residential real estate industry not experiencing a significant decline in the prices at which homes are bought and sold. If COVID-19's economic impacts cause home transaction prices to decline, and especially if the decline occurs at an accelerated rate, our business will be adversely effected.\nOur business is concentrated in certain geographic markets. Our failure to adapt to any substantial shift in the relative percentage of residential housing transactions from these markets to other markets in the United States could adversely affect our financial performance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our top-10 markets by real estate services revenue consisted of the metropolitan areas of Boston, Chicago, Denver (including Boulder and Colorado Springs), Los Angeles (including Santa Barbara), Maryland, Northern Virginia, Portland (including Bend), San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle.\nLocal and regional conditions in these markets may differ significantly from prevailing conditions in the United States or other parts of the country. Accordingly, events may adversely and disproportionately affect demand for and sales prices of homes in these markets. Any overall or disproportionate downturn in demand or home prices in any of our largest markets, particularly if we are unable to increase revenue from our other markets, could adversely affect growth of our revenue and market share or otherwise harm our business.\nOur top markets are primarily major metropolitan areas, where home prices and transaction volumes are generally higher than other markets. As a result, our real estate services revenue and gross margin are generally higher in these markets than in our smaller markets. To the extent people migrate to cities outside of these markets due to lower home prices or other factors, such as COVID-19, and this migration continues to take place over the long-term, then the relative percentage of residential housing transactions may shift away from our historical top markets where we have historically generated most of our revenue. Our inability to effectively adapt to any shift, including failing to increase revenue from other markets, could adversely affect our financial performance and market share.\nCompetition in each of our lines of business is intense.\nMany of our competitors across each of our businesses have substantial competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories, stronger brand recognition, greater financial resources, more management, sales, marketing and other resources, superior local referral networks, perceived local knowledge and expertise, and extensive relationships with participants in the residential real estate industry, including third-party data providers such as multiple listing services (\"MLSs\"). Consequently, these competitors may have an advantage in recruiting and retaining agents, attracting consumers, and growing their businesses. They may also be able to provide consumers with offerings that are different from or superior to those we provide. The success of our competitors could result in our loss of market share and harm our business.\nWe may be unable to maintain or improve our current technology offerings at a competitive level or develop new technology offerings that meet customer or agent expectations. Our technology offerings may also contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities.\nOur technology offerings, including tools, features, and products, are key to our competitive plan for attracting potential customers and hiring and retaining lead agents. Maintaining or improving our current technology to meet evolving industry standards and customer and agent expectations, as well as developing commercially successful and innovative new technology, is challenging and expensive. For example, the nature of development cycles may result in delays between the time we incur expenses and the time we introduce new technology and generate revenue, if any, from those investments. Anticipated customer demand for a technology offering could also decrease after the development cycle has commenced, and we would not be able to recoup costs, which may be substantial, we incurred.\nAs standards and expectations evolve and new technology becomes available, we may be unable to identify, design, develop, and implement, in a timely and cost-effective manner, new technology offerings to meet those standards and expectations. As a result, we may be unable to compete effectively, and to the extent our competitors develop new technology offerings faster than us, they may render our offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Additionally, even if we implemented new technology offerings in a timely manner, our customers and agents may not accept or be satisfied by the offerings.\nFor example, COVID-19 has, for at least the short-term, affected the way that customers tour homes and interact with their real estate agent, as more tours and interactions have shifted towards electronic or virtual mediums. While we have updated our technology offerings in an attempt to respond to this change, there is no assurance that customers will adopt our updated technology offerings over those of our competitors. To the extent that the shift in customer touring and interaction develop into a long-term trend and we fail to update our technology offerings to respond to this shift, then we may be unable to attract potential customers. Furthermore, it is also possible that customers will revert to more traditional ways of touring homes and interacting with their agents when COVID-19's impacts have subsided. In that scenario, our updated technology offerings focused on electronic or virtual mediums may become obsolete or less frequently used than we anticipated, and we will be unable to recoup the costs that we have incurred and are currently incurring in developing these offerings.\nFurthermore, our development and testing processes may not detect errors and vulnerabilities in our technology offerings prior to their implementation. Any inefficiencies, errors, technical problems, or vulnerabilities arising in our technology offerings after their release could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers' and agents' access to and use of our technology and offerings.\nWe may be unable to obtain and provide comprehensive and accurate real estate listings quickly, or at all.\nWe believe that users of our website and mobile application come to us primarily because of the real estate listing data that we provide. Accordingly, if we were unable to obtain and provide comprehensive and accurate real estate listings data, our primary channels for meeting customers will be diminished. We get listings data primarily from MLSs in the markets we serve. We also source listings data from public records, other third-party listing providers, and individual homeowners and brokers. Many of our competitors and other real estate websites also have access to MLSs and other listings data, including proprietary data, and may be able to source listings data or other real estate information faster or more efficiently than we can. Since MLS participation is voluntary, brokers and homeowners may decline to post their listings data to their local MLS or may seek to change or limit the way that data is distributed. A competitor or another industry participant could also create an alternative listings data service, which may reduce the relevancy and comprehensive nature of the MLSs. If MLSs cease to be the predominant source of listings data in the markets that we serve, we may be unable to get access to comprehensive listings data on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may result in fewer people using our website and mobile application.\nWe rely on business data to make decisions and drive our machine-learning technology, and errors or inaccuracies in such data may adversely affect our business decisions and the customer experience.\nWe regularly analyze business data to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, establish budgets, and make strategic decisions. Much of this data is internally generated and has not been independently verified. While our business decisions are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring and interpreting the data, and we cannot be certain that the data are accurate. Errors or inaccuracies in the data could result in poor business decisions, resource allocation, or strategic initiatives. For example, if we overestimate traffic to our website and mobile application, we may not invest an adequate amount of resources in attracting new customers or we may hire more lead agents in a given market than necessary to meet customer demand.\nWe also use our business data and proprietary algorithms to inform our machine learning, such as in the calculation of our Redfin Estimate, which provides an estimate on the market value of individual homes. If customers disagree with us or if our Redfin Estimate fails to accurately reflect market pricing such that we are unable to attract homebuyers or help our customers sell their homes at satisfactory prices, or at all, customers may lose confidence in us.\nWe may be unable to attract homebuyers and home sellers to our website and mobile application in a cost-effective manner.\nOur website and mobile application are our primary channels for meeting customers. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to attract homebuyers and home sellers to our website and mobile application in a cost-effective manner. To meet customers, we rely heavily on traffic generated from search engines and downloads of our mobile application from mobile application stores. We also rely on marketing methods such as targeted email campaigns, paid search advertising, social media marketing, and traditional media, including TV, radio, and billboards.\nThe number of visitors to our website and downloads of our mobile application depend in large part on how and where our website and mobile application rank in Internet search results and mobile application stores, respectively. While we use search engine optimization to help our website rank highly in search results, maintaining or improving our search result rankings is not within our control. Internet search engines frequently update and change their ranking algorithms, referral methodologies, or design layouts, which determine the placement and display of a user\u2019s search results. In some instances, Internet search engines may change these rankings in order to promote their own competing services or the services of one or more of our competitors. Similarly, mobile application stores can change how they display searches and how mobile applications are featured. For instance, editors at the Apple iTunes Store can feature prominently editor-curated mobile applications and cause the mobile application to appear larger than other applications or more visibly on a featured list.\nAdditionally, our marketing efforts may fail to attract the desired number of customers for a variety of reasons, including the creative treatment for our advertisements may be ineffective or new third-party email delivery policies that make it more difficult for us to execute targeted email campaigns.\nIf we are unable to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices, whether through our mobile website or mobile application, we may be unable to attract and retain customers.\nDeveloping and supporting a mobile website and mobile application across multiple operating systems and devices requires substantial time and resources. We may not be able to consistently provide a rewarding customer experience on mobile devices and, as a result, customers we meet through our mobile website or mobile application may not choose to use our services at the same rate as customers we meet through our website.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile operating systems are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting our mobile website or mobile application for them. Developing or supporting our mobile website or mobile application for new devices and their operating systems may require substantial time and resources. The success of our mobile website and mobile application could also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as:\n\u2022increased costs to develop, distribute, or maintain our mobile website or mobile application;\n\u2022changes to the terms of service or requirements of a mobile application store that requires us to change our mobile application development or features in an adverse manner; and\n\u2022changes in mobile operating systems, such as Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android, that disproportionately affect us, degrade the functionality of our mobile website or mobile application, require that we make costly upgrades to our technology offerings, or give preferential treatment to competitors' websites or mobile applications.\nOur business model of employing lead agents subjects us to challenges not faced by our competitors. Our ability to hire and retain a sufficient number of lead agents is critical to our ability to maintain and grow our market share and to provide an adequate level of service to customers who want to work with our lead agents.\nAs a result of our business model of employing our lead agents, our lead agents generally earn less on a per transaction basis than traditional agents who work as independent contractors at traditional brokerages. Because our model is uncommon in our industry, agents considering working for us may not understand our compensation model or may not perceive it to be more attractive than the independent contractor, commission-driven compensation model used by most traditional brokerages. If we are unable to attract, retain, effectively train, motivate, and utilize lead agents, we will be unable to grow our business and we may be required to change our compensation model, which could significantly increase our lead agent compensation or other costs.\nAlso as a result of employing our lead agents, we incur costs that our brokerage competitors do not, such as base pay, employee benefits, expense reimbursement, training, and employee transactional support staff. As a result, we have significant costs that, in the event of downturns in demand in the markets we serve, may result in us being unable to adjust as rapidly as some of our competitors. In turn, such downturns may impact us more than our competitors.\nConversely, in times of rapidly rising demand we may face a shortfall of lead agents. To the extent our customer demand increases from current levels, our ability to adequately serve the additional customers, and in turn grow our revenue and U.S. market share by value, depends, in part, on our ability to timely hire and retain additional lead agents. To the extent we are unable to hire, either timely or at all, or retain the required number of lead agents to serve our customer demand, we will be unable to maximize our revenue and market share growth. Although we are able to refer excess demand to our partner agents, historically our partner agents have closed transactions with customers they meet at a lower rate than our lead agents and have generated lower revenue per transaction.\nAdditionally, due to the costs of employing our lead agents, lead agent turnover may be more costly to us than to traditional brokerages. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to achieve the necessary level of lead agent productivity and retention to offset their related costs.\nReferring customers to our partner agents may harm our business.\nWe refer customers to third-party partner agents when we do not have a lead agent available due to high demand or geographic limitations. Our dependence on partner agents can be particularly heavy in certain new markets as we build our operations to scale in those markets or during times of rapidly rising demand for our services. Our partner agents are independent licensed agents affiliated with other brokerages, and we do not have any control over their actions. If our partner agents were to provide poor customer service, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the laws and rules to which we are subject, we may be subject to legal claims and our reputation and business may be harmed.\nOur arrangements with third parties may limit our growth and brand awareness. For example, referring customers to partner agents potentially redirects repeat and referral opportunities to the partner agents. Any third-party arrangements may also dilute the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and may lead to consumer confusion or dissatisfaction when they are offered the opportunity to work with the third party rather than us.\nIf we do not comply with the rules, terms of service, and policies of MLSs, our access to and use of listings data may be restricted or terminated.\nWe must comply with an MLS\u2019s rules, terms of service, and policies to access and use its listings data. We belong to numerous MLSs, and each has adopted its own rules, terms of service, and policies governing, among other things, how MLS data may be used and how listings data must be displayed on our website and mobile application. These rules typically do not contemplate multi-jurisdictional online brokerages like ours and vary widely among markets. They also are in some cases inconsistent with the rules of other MLSs such that we are required to customize our website, mobile application, or service to accommodate differences between MLS rules. Complying with the rules of each MLS requires significant investment, including personnel, technology and development resources, and the exercise of considerable judgment. If we are deemed to be noncompliant with an MLS\u2019s rules, we may face disciplinary sanctions in that MLS, which could include monetary fines, restricting or terminating our access to that MLS\u2019s data, or other disciplinary measures. The loss or degradation of this listings data could materially and adversely affect traffic to our website and mobile application, making us less relevant to consumers and restricting our ability to attract customers. It also could reduce agent and customer confidence in our services and harm our business.\nIf we fail to comply with the requirements governing the licensing of our brokerage, mortgage, and title businesses in the jurisdictions in which we operate, then our ability to operate those businesses in those jurisdictions may be revoked.\nRedfin, as a brokerage, and our agents must comply with the requirements governing the licensing and conduct of real estate brokerage and brokerage-related businesses in the markets where we operate. Furthermore, we are also required to comply with the requirements governing the licensing and conduct of mortgage and title and settlement businesses in the markets where we operate. Due to the geographic scope of our operations, we and our agents may not be in compliance with all of the required licenses at all times. Additionally, if we enter into new markets, we may become subject to additional licensing requirements. If we or our agents fail to obtain or maintain the required licenses for conducting our brokerage, mortgage, and title businesses or fail to strictly adhere to associated regulations, the relevant government authorities may order us to suspend relevant operations or impose fines or other penalties.\nRedfinNow may overestimate the amount it should pay to purchase a home, and homes owned by it may significantly decline in value prior to being sold.\nRedfinNow uses automated valuations and forecasts in concert with our real estate knowledge to assess what a home is worth and how much to pay for its purchase. This assessment includes estimates on time of possession, market conditions and proceeds on resale, renovation costs, and holding costs. The assessment may not be accurate, and RedfinNow may pay too much for the home to realize our desired investment return. Additionally, following its acquisition of a home, RedfinNow may need to decrease its anticipated resale price for the home if it discovers a defect in the home that was unknown at the time of acquisition. This adjustment to the price may also affect our investment return on the home.\nHomes that RedfinNow owns may also rapidly lose in value or become more difficult to sell for an acceptable price due to changing market conditions, natural disasters, or other forces outside of our control. RedfinNow's geographic concentration in six states - Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada (where we are currently inactive), Texas, and Washington - particularly exposes it to the factors affecting home value and saleability in those states that may not apply to the United States generally. As a result, we may be required to significantly write down the inventory value of homes and, to the extent we are able to resell homes at all, resell them at a price that is substantially less than our costs of acquiring and renovating the homes.\nRedfinNow relies, in part, on third parties to renovate and repair homes before it resells the homes, and the cost or availability of third-party labor could adversely affect our holding period and investment return for homes.\nUpon purchasing a home, RedfinNow frequently needs to renovate or repair parts of the home prior to listing it for resale. RedfinNow relies, in part, on third-party contractors and sub-contractors to make these renovations and repairs. These third-party providers may not be able to complete the required renovations or repairs within RedfinNow's expected timeline or proposed budget. Furthermore, if the quality of a third-party provider's work does not meet RedfinNow's expectations, then RedfinNow may need to engage another third-party contractor or subcontractor, which may also adversely affect its timeline or budget for completing renovations or repairs.\nA longer than expected period for completing renovations or repairs could negatively impact RedfinNow's ability to sell a home within its anticipated timeline. This prolonged timing exposes us to factors that adversely affect the home's resale value and may result in RedfinNow selling the home for a lower price than anticipated or not being able to sell the home at all. Meanwhile, incurring more than budgeted costs would adversely affect our investment return on purchased homes.\nThe net proceeds that Redfin Mortgage receives from its sale of mortgage loans that it originates may not exceed the loan amount. Additionally, Redfin Mortgage may also be unable to sell its originated loans at all. In that situation, Redfin Mortgage will need to service the loans and potentially foreclose on the home by itself or through a third party, and either option could impose significant costs, time, and resources on Redfin Mortgage. Redfin Mortgage\u2019s inability to sell its originated loans could also expose us to adverse market conditions affecting mortgage loans.\nRedfin Mortgage intends to sell the mortgage loans that it originates to investors in the secondary mortgage market. Redfin Mortgage's ability to sell its originated loans in the secondary market, and receive net proceeds from the sale that exceed the loan amount, depends largely on there being sufficient liquidity in the secondary market and its compliance with contracts with investors who have purchased the loans.\nIf Redfin Mortgage were unable to sell its originated loans, either initially or following a repurchase, then it may need to establish a servicing platform or hire a third party to service the loans. Redfin Mortgage does not currently have a robust servicing platform and establishing such a platform may result in significant costs and require substantial time and resources from its management. Additionally, Redfin Mortgage may be unable to retain a third-party servicer on economically feasible terms.\nTo the extent that Redfin Mortgage is unable to sell its originated loans, either initially or following a repurchase, we would be exposed to adverse market conditions affecting mortgage loans. For example, we may be required to write down the value of the loan, which reduces the amount of our current assets. Additionally, if Redfin Mortgage borrowed under a warehouse credit facility for the loan, then it will be required to repay the borrowed amount, which reduces our cash on hand that is available for other corporate uses. Finally, if a homeowner were unable to make his or her mortgage payments, then we may be required to foreclose on the home securing the loan. Redfin Mortgage does not currently have processes to foreclose a home, and it may be unable to establish such processes or retain a third party on economically feasible terms to foreclose the home. Furthermore, any proceeds from selling a foreclosed home may be significantly less than the remaining amount of the loan due to Redfin Mortgage\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from, and may incur substantial costs related to, our pending acquisition of RentPath.\nOn February 19, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire RentPath. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. This acquisition is subject to antitrust approval and approval from the court handling RentPath's bankruptcy proceedings, as well as other customary closing conditions. To the extent these approval are not obtained, or if any other closing condition is not satisfied (and not waived by us, to the extent waivable), then we will be unable to consummate our purchase of RentPath. Even if we are able to close our acquisition, it may not result in the intended benefits to our business. We may also be required to record impairment charges associated with the acquisition. Integrating RentPath will be challenging and time consuming, and may subject us to additional costs that we have not anticipated in evaluating the transaction.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business or result in the loss of critical and confidential information.\nCybersecurity incidents directed at us or our third-party service providers can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. Cybersecurity incidents are also constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party service providers collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our customers and employees, including personally identifiable information. Additionally, we rely on third-parties and their security procedures for the secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of information are critical to our operations. Despite measures designed to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate cybersecurity incidents, such incidents may occur to us or our third-party providers and, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption, or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees) and the disruption of business operations. Any such compromises to our security, or that of our third-party providers, could cause customers to lose trust and confidence in us and stop using our website and mobile applications. In addition, we may incur significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information, repair of system damage, and compensation to customers, employees, and business partners. We may also be subject to government enforcement proceedings and legal claims by private parties.\nWe process, transmit, and store personal information, and unauthorized access to, or the unintended release of, this information could result in a claim for damages, regulatory action, loss of business, or unfavorable publicity.\nWe process, transmit, and store personal information to provide services to our customers and as an employer. As a result, we are subject to certain contractual terms, as well as federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect personal information. While we take measures to protect the security and privacy of this information, it is possible that our security controls over personal data and other practices we follow may not prevent the unauthorized access to, or the unintended release of, personal information. If such unauthorized access or unintended release occurred, we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation, customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our services, and we could incur significant costs to address and fix these security incidents. These incidents could also lead to lawsuits and regulatory investigations and enforcement actions.\nWe rely on third-party licensed technology, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels.\nWe employ certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies in our technology. Our reliance on this third-party software may become costly if the licensor increases the price for the license or changes the terms of use and we cannot find commercially reasonable alternatives. Even if we were to find an alternative, integration of our technology with new third-party software may require substantial investment of our time and resources.\nAny undetected errors or defects in the third-party software we license could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our technology, delay new service offerings, or result in a failure of our website or mobile application.\nWe use open source software in some aspects of our technology and may fail to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses.\nOur technology incorporates software covered by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and if they were interpreted, such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated restrictions on our technology. If portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in our use of such software, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies.\nMoreover, our processes for controlling our use of open source software may not be effective. If we do not comply with the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our services on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our technology to remove or replace the open source software, to discontinue the use of certain technology if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, to pay monetary damages, to make generally available the source code for our proprietary technology, or to waive certain intellectual property rights.\nWe may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our technology and methodologies, enforce our intellectual property rights, or protect our other proprietary business information.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our intellectual property and our other proprietary business information. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and contractual provisions and restrictions. However, we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our technology and methodologies or the steps we take to enforce our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Furthermore, we may also be unable to protect our proprietary business information from misappropriation.\nIf we are unable to secure intellectual property rights, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market offerings similar to ours and we would have no recourse to enjoin or stop their actions. Additionally, any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others and invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. Moreover, even if we secured our intellectual property rights, others may infringe on our intellectual property and we may be unable to successfully enforce our rights against the infringers because we may be unaware of the infringement or our legal actions may not be successful. Finally, others may misappropriate our proprietary business information, and we may be unaware of the misappropriation or unable to enforce our legal rights in a cost-effective manner. If any of these events were to occur, our ability to compete effectively would be impaired.\nWe may be unable to maintain and scale the technology underlying our offerings.\nAs the number of homebuyers and home sellers, agents, and listings shared on our website and mobile application and the extent and types of data grow, our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow. Operating our underlying technology systems is expensive and complex, and we could experience operational failures. If we experience interruptions or failures in these systems for any reason, the security and availability of our services and technologies could be affected.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, and our compliance with these laws, or the enforcement of our rights under these laws, may increase our expenses, require management's resources, or force us to change our business practices.\nWe are currently subject to a variety of, and may in the future become subject to additional, federal, state, and local laws. The laws include, but are not limited to, those relating to real estate, brokerage, title, mortgage, advertising, privacy and consumer protection, labor and employment, and intellectual property. These laws and their related regulations may evolve frequently and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Additionally, certain of these laws and regulations were created for traditional real estate brokerages, and it is unclear how they may affect us given our business model that is unlike traditional brokerages or certain of our services that historically have not been offered by traditional brokerages.\nThese laws can be costly for us to comply with or enforce. Additionally, if we are unable to comply with and become liable for violations of these laws, or if courts or regulatory bodies provide unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations, our operations in affected markets may become prohibitively expensive, consume significant amounts of management's time, or need to be discontinued.\nWe are subject to costs associated with defending and resolving proceedings brought by government entities and claims brought by private parties.\nWe are from time to time involved in, and may in the future be subject to, government investigations or enforcement actions and private third-party claims arising from the laws to which we are subject or the contracts to which we are a party. Such investigations, actions, and claims include, but are not limited to, matters relating to employment law (including misclassification), intellectual property, privacy and consumer protection, website accessibility, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 or other fair housing statutes, cybersecurity incidents, data breaches, commercial or contractual disputes, and exposure to COVID-19. They may also relate to ordinary-course brokerage disputes, including, but not limited to, failure to disclose property defects, failure to meet client legal obligations, commission disputes, personal injury or property damage claims, and vicarious liability based upon conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control, including partner agents and third-party contractor agents. See Item 3 for a discussion of pending third-party claims that we believe may be material to us.\nAny such investigations, actions, or claims can be costly to defend or resolve, require significant time from management, or result in negative publicity. Furthermore, to the extent we are unsuccessful in defending an action or claim, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including significant fines or damages, the loss of ability to operate in a jurisdiction, or the need to change certain business practices (including redesigning, or obtaining a license for, our technology or modifying or ceasing to offer certain services).\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow to make the payments required by our convertible senior notes, and a failure to make payments when due may result in the entire principal amount of the convertible senior notes becoming due prior to the notes' maturity, which may result in our bankruptcy.\nWe are required to pay interest on our 2023 notes on a semi-annual basis. In addition, holders of our convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Furthermore, holders of our 2023 notes and 2025 notes have the right to convert their notes upon any of the conditions described below:\n\u2022during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the notes on each applicable trading day;\n\u2022during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate of the notes on each such trading day;\n\u2022if we call any or all of the notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day prior to the redemption date; or\n\u2022upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nIf any of these conversion features under either our 2023 notes or 2025 notes are triggered, then holders of such notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Upon conversion, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share). One of the conditional conversion features of our 2023 notes has been triggered and such notes are convertible through at least March 31, 2021.\nOur ability to make these payments depends on having sufficient cash on hand when the payments are due. Our cash availability, in turn, depends on our future performance, which is subject to the other risks described in this Item 1A. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make the payments when due, then we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, refinancing the notes, or raising additional capital. However, we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms.\nOur failure to make payments when due may result in an event of default under the indentures governing our convertible senior notes and cause (i) with respect to the 2023 notes, the remaining $23,777,000 aggregate principal amount and (ii) with respect to the 2025 notes, the entire $661,250,000 aggregate principal amount, plus, in each case, any accrued and unpaid interest, to become due immediately and prior to the maturity date. Any such acceleration of the principal amount could result in our bankruptcy. In a bankruptcy, the holders of our convertible senior notes would have a claim to our assets that is senior to the claims of holders of our common stock.\nConversion of a significant principal amount of our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and depress the price of our common stock.\nUpon any conversion of our 2023 notes or our 2025 notes (see the risk factor immediately above for conversion triggers), we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, then the conversion of a significant principal amount of such notes, and any subsequent sales of shares of our common stock issued upon conversion, may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nRedfinNow relies on a secured revolving credit facility to finance its purchase of certain homes. RedfinNow intends to rely on proceeds from the sale of financed homes to repay amounts owed under such facility, but in certain instances, such proceeds may be insufficient or unavailable to repay the amounts owed.\nPursuant to a secured revolving credit facility with Goldman Sachs, RedfinNow Borrower, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Redfin Corporation, may borrow money to partially fund purchases of homes for our properties business. RedfinNow Borrower has the option of repaying amounts owed with respect to a particular financed home upon the sale of such home and using the proceeds from such sale. However, there is no assurance the sale proceeds will equal or exceed the amounts owed.\nAdditionally, in certain instances, RedfinNow Borrower may be required to repay amounts owed with respect to a financed home prior to the sale of that home. For example, the amount that RedfinNow Borrower is eligible to borrow for a home, which we refer to as the advance rate, depends, in part, on how long it has owned that home. As RedfinNow Borrower owns a home past certain time periods, the advance rate decreases and it becomes obligated to repay all or a portion of the borrowed funds. Additionally, a home must satisfy certain criteria to be eligible for financing under the facility. If a financed home ceases to satisfy the criteria, then RedfinNow Borrower must immediately repay all amounts owed with respect to the home. If either of these scenarios occur, then RedfinNow Borrower will be unable to rely on the proceeds from the sale of the home for repayment.\nIn the situations described above, RedfinNow Borrower must use its cash on hand to repay the amounts owed. To the extent it does not have sufficient cash and is unable to make the required repayments, then RedfinNow Borrower may default under the facility.\nOur inability to comply with the terms of RedfinNow's secured revolving credit facility may adversely affect our properties business and, in some instances, give the lenders recourse to Redfin Corporation when the value of the assets securing the facility are insufficient to cover the amounts owed to the lenders.\nBorrowings under our secured revolving credit facility are secured by RedfinNow Borrower's assets, including the financed homes, as well as the equity interests in RedfinNow Borrower. To the extent RedfinNow Borrower is unable to make payments when due under the facility, or it or certain other Redfin entities are unable to comply with the facility's ongoing obligations (including financial covenants of Redfin Corporation), then an event of default may occur. An event of default would require RedfinNow Borrower to immediately repay all amounts owned under the facility and cause RedfinNow Borrower to be unable to borrow from the facility. As a result, our properties business will need to rely solely on our available cash to fund home purchases, and to the extent cash is unavailable, our properties business would be unable to purchase the homes required for its growth. Furthermore, an event of default may result in Goldman Sachs owning RedfinNow Borrower's equity interests or its assets, including any financed homes and cash held by RedfinNow Borrower, and result in our properties business losing a portion of its assets.\nWhile the lenders' recourse in most situations following an event of default is only to RedfinNow Borrower or its assets, Redfin Corporation has guaranteed amounts owed under the facility and certain expenses in situations involving \"bad acts\" by a Redfin entity. To the extent a Redfin entity commits a \"bad act,\" then Redfin Corporation may become obligated to pay such amounts owed or certain expenses.\nIf Redfin Mortgage is unable to obtain sufficient financing through warehouse credit facilities to fund its origination of mortgage loans, then we may be unable to grow our mortgage origination business.\nRedfin Mortgage relies on borrowings from warehouse credit facilities to fund substantially all of the mortgage loans that it originates. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for the current terms of these warehouse credit facilities. To grow its business, Redfin Mortgage depends, in part, on having sufficient borrowing capacity under its current facilities or obtaining additional borrowing capacity under new facilities. The borrowing capacity under one of its current facilities may be reduced if Redfin Mortgage fails to comply with the facility's ongoing obligations, including failing to satisfy financial covenants applicable to Redfin Mortgage. If it were unable to receive the necessary capacity on acceptable terms, and did not have sufficient liquidity or established operations to fund originations itself, then Redfin Mortgage may be unable to maintain or increase the amount of mortgage loans that it originates, which will adversely affect its growth.\nThe cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions in the agreements governing our current indebtedness may result in an immediate obligation to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe indentures governing our 2023 notes and our 2025 notes and our warehouse credit facilities contain cross-acceleration provisions while our secured revolving credit facility contains a cross-default provision. These provisions could have the effect of creating an event of default under an agreement for our indebtedness, despite our compliance with that agreement, due solely to an event of default or failure to pay amounts owed under another agreement for our indebtedness. Accordingly, all or a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness could become immediately payable due solely to our failure to comply with the terms of a single agreement governing our indebtedness.\nIf the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") is discontinued, interest payments under our secured revolving credit facility and certain warehouse credit facilities may be calculated using another reference rate.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. In response, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has proposed replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), which is a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements and backed by U.S. Treasury securities. The market transition away from LIBOR towards SOFR is expected to be complicated, and there is no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate throughout our secured revolving credit facility and certain of our warehouse credit facilities. The transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR and may result in increased borrowing costs, the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, uncertainty under our secured revolving credit facility and certain of our warehouse credit facilities, or difficult and costly processes to amend such documentation. There remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate, and we are uncertain what impact a transition away from LIBOR may have on our business, financial results, and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Preferred Stock\nWe may be required to make cash payments to our preferred stockholders before our preferred stock's final redemption date of November 30, 2024, and any cash payments may materially reduce our net working capital.\nOn November 30, 2024, we will be required to redeem all shares of our convertible preferred stock then outstanding and pay accrued dividends on those shares. A preferred stockholder has the option of receiving cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares for this redemption. However, before this redemption, we may be required to make cash payments to our preferred stockholders in the two situations described below, and any such cash payments will reduce our cash available for other corporate uses and may materially reduce our net working capital.\nDividends accrue on each $1,000 of our outstanding convertible preferred stock at a rate of 5.5% per year and are payable quarterly. Assuming we satisfy the \"equity conditions\" (as defined in the certificate of designation governing our preferred stock), we will pay dividends in shares of our common stock. These conditions principally include (i) we have ensured the liquidity and transferability of our common stock held by the preferred stockholders, (ii) we have issued common stock and paid cash to the preferred stockholders, as required by the certificate of designation, (iii) we are not in bankruptcy or have had a bankruptcy proceeding instituted against us, and (iv) we have not breached an agreement that governs the preferred stockholders' rights with respect to the preferred stock and such breach materially and adversely impacts our business or a preferred stockholder's economic benefits under the agreement. However, if we fail to satisfy these \"equity conditions,\" then we must pay cash dividends in amount equal to (i) the number of shares of our common stock that we would have issued as dividends, assuming we satisfied the conditions, multiplied by (ii) the volume-weighted average closing price of our common stock for the ten trading days preceding the date the dividends are payable.\nA preferred stockholder has the right to require us to redeem its preferred stock for cash following the occurrence of a \"triggering event\" (as defined in the certificate of designation governing our preferred stock). These events are similar in nature to the \"equity conditions\" described above. The cash payment, for each share of preferred stock, would equal the sum of (i) $1,000, (ii) any accrued dividends on the preferred stock, and (iii) an amount equal to all scheduled dividend payments (excluding any accrued dividends) on the preferred stock for all remaining dividend periods from the date the preferred stockholder requests redemption through November 29, 2024.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the U.S. federal district courts as the exclusive forums for certain types of actions that may be initiated by our stockholders. These provisions may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \"Court of Chancery\") will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to actions arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or, as described below, the Securities Act of 1933.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation further provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the U.S. federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933. Notwithstanding this provision, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.", "PERMNO": 16829, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "RDFN"}
