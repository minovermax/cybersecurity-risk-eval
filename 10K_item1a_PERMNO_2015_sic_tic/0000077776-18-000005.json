{"cik": "77776", "company": "PHH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, many of which are beyond our control. You should carefully consider each of the following risks described below and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating us. You should also consider the information set forth above under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows in future periods and are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Strategies\nWe may fail to consummate the proposed Merger, and uncertainties related to the consummation of the Merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and negatively impact the price of our Common stock.\nAs previously discussed, on February 27, 2018, we announced that we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger with Ocwen Financial Corporation (\u201cOcwen\u201d), and POMS Corp (\u201cMergerSub\u201d) pursuant to which all of PHH\u2019s outstanding common stock will be acquired by Ocwen in a merger of PHH with and into MergerSub with PHH surviving (the \u201cMerger\u201d) in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $360 million, or $11.00 per share on a fully-diluted basis.\nThe Merger is subject to, in addition to various other customary closing conditions: approval by our stockholders; antitrust, state licensing, and other governmental and regulatory approvals; PHH maintaining a minimum adjusted net worth of a prescribed amount ranging from $393 million to $489 million and a minimum amount of available cash on hand ranging from $293 million to $367 million, in each case depending upon when such condition is tested; the completion of our previously announced purchase of Realogy Corporation\u2019s ownership interests in PHH Home Loans, LLC; and the substantial completion of our previously announced exit from our private label originations business. The measurement date for establishing whether the conditions regarding minimum adjusted net worth and minimum unrestricted cash have been satisfied will be determined following approval of our stockholders and receipt of the regulatory approvals necessary for us to consummate the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this type. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we have also agreed to certain covenants, including customary \u201cno shop\u201d restrictions that prohibit us from soliciting, or providing information or entering into discussions concerning proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions, except in response to a bona fide unsolicited written acquisition proposal that our Board of Directors has determined constitute, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Company Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights by PHH and Ocwen. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, including due to our acceptance of a Superior Company Proposal prior to approval of the Merger by PHH\u2019s stockholders, we will pay Ocwen a termination fee of approximately $13 million.\nThere is no assurance that the Merger will occur on the terms and timeline currently contemplated or at all. Potential risks and uncertainties related to the Merger include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nThe Merger Agreement generally requires that we operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the proposed Merger and restricts us, without Ocwen\u2019s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. As a result, we may have foregone opportunities that we might have otherwise pursued absent the proposed Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nThe efforts to satisfy the closing conditions of the proposed Merger, including the stockholder and regulatory approval processes, may place a significant burden on management and internal resources, and the Merger whether or not consummated, may result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day operations and result in a disruption of our operations. Any significant diversion of management attention away from our ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the Merger process could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe proposed Merger could cause disruptions to our business relationships. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships us. In\naddition, competitors may target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and difficulties that may result from the Merger.\n\u2022\nCurrent and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel while the Merger is pending. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the Merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to in the past.\n\u2022\nWe could be subject to litigation related to the proposed Merger, which could result in significant costs and expenses. Litigation is very common in connection with the sale of public companies, regardless of whether the claims have any merit. In addition to potential litigation-related expenses, we have incurred and will continue to incur other costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the proposed Merger is consummated.\n\u2022\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights as described above. If the proposed Merger is not completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated, the price of our Common stock may decline, including to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be consummated without unexpected delays.\nAll of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to risks related to our continued efforts towards executing our remaining strategic actions, and any failures to execute anticipated actions, in whole or in part, any variances from our estimate of proceeds or costs, or any losses realized from related contractual contingencies, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and there can be no assurance that such actions will be beneficial to our shareholders.\nIn February 2017, we announced certain strategic actions, including our intentions to transition our business model to operate as a smaller, less capital-intensive business that is focused on subservicing and portfolio retention services. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed all of our strategic actions necessary to transition to our new business model, and we may be unable to fully or successfully execute or implement our remaining actions, in whole or in part, or within the projected time frame. Remaining actions include, but are not limited to: (i) executing the remaining sales of Mortgage servicing rights, (ii) closing and selling the remaining PLS and Real Estate mortgage pipelines and completing PLS client contractual transition and support requirements; (iii) monetizing our remaining residual assets, including those of our PHH Home Loans joint venture; and (iv) completing our reduction of our overhead cost structure. See further discussion actions completed in 2017, and the remaining actions in \"Part II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Summary\" of this Form 10-K.\nWe are exposed to risks specific to the execution of remaining actions and business transitions, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe MSRs and advances committed under our agreement with New Residential Mortgage, LLC (\"New Residential\") consist of private investor MSRs and related advances and the sale thereof is subject to the approval of multiple counterparties, including private loan investor, trustees and/or client (originations source) approvals, as well as other customary closing requirements;\n\u2022\nour need to maintain the appropriate level of overhead through the transition period to support execution of transactions and business transitions, sustain our ongoing client relationships and to maintain compliance with all applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements of our business;\n\u2022\nour need to maintain our internal and operational control structures during the business transition period, including managing the transition of control processes to third-party outsource providers;\n\u2022\nefforts towards executing our remaining strategic actions could cause management distractions and disruptions in our continuing businesses; and\n\u2022\nany disruptions in or uncertainty around our business could affect our relationships with customers and/or other counterparties, may have negative impacts on our ability to obtain or renew financing or wind down the operations of the PLS business and Real Estate channel, among other impacts.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurances that these actions will have the impact that we intend on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. While we have assessed the potential benefits that could be realized, as well as the potential costs and operating losses that could be incurred, as a result of these actions, our assessments and estimates may differ materially from actual costs and the benefits realized. Factors that drive this uncertainty include, among other factors, employee attrition, the expected\ntiming of related actions, and contractual complexities. Any such deviations could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows, and may not be beneficial to our shareholders.\nWe have provided certain representations and warranties in our MSR sale agreements. To the extent that we have made inaccurate representations or warranties or fail to perform, we could incur liability to the purchasers of these MSRs pursuant to the contractual provisions of our sale agreements. In addition, transfers of servicing are subject to regulation under federal consumer finance laws, including CFPB rules implementing RESPA that require servicers to, among other things, maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to facilitate the transfer of accurate information and documents during mortgage servicing transfers. While we believe we have complied with these requirements, the CFPB has advised mortgage servicers that its examiners will be carefully reviewing servicers\u2019 compliance with these and other regulations applicable to servicing transfers. Accordingly, we devoted significant time and resources to our compliance efforts in connection with our transfers of mortgage servicing. If we fail to comply with regulations relating to servicing transfers in connection with dispositions of MSRs, we could be subject to adverse regulatory actions, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we have provided certain representations and warranties, and assumed other unique risks, in connection with our other transactions and exit activities resulting from our strategic actions, including but not limited to, those associated with certain lease assignments to LenderLive Network, LLC (\"LenderLive\") and Guaranteed Rate Affinity, LLC (\"GRA\"). Under the terms of the lease assignments and original facility leases, we remain jointly and severally obligated with LenderLive and GRA and we are subject to risk associated with the nonperformance of these counterparties under the lease agreements.\nOur operations have not been profitable in recent years, and we have changed the focus of our business to subservicing and portfolio retention activities to improve our financial results. The industry in which we operate in is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to attract and retain clients to achieve scale and meet competitive challenges, which may be negatively impacted by client perceptions of a lack of history operating as a focused player in this market, as well as from our actions, including any past or future efforts towards executing our strategic actions. We may not be able to fully or successfully execute or implement our business strategies or achieve our objectives, and our actions taken may not have the intended result.\nWe expect to incur continued operating losses in 2018, as we complete the exit of our PLS business and execute our remaining reorganization actions and business transitions. Based on our current assessment of the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"), which contains provisions that eliminate the net operating loss carryback, we recognized a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017. With respect to our expectations for continued operating losses, we expect to reflect a full valuation allowance and loss of substantially all income tax benefits against such future operating losses. Our assessment of the impact of the Tax Act on our future results is based upon our current interpretation thereof and remains subject to further clarifications.\nOur strategic actions to date have allowed us to make progress towards achieving our new business model of operating as a smaller, less capital intensive business that is focused on subservicing and portfolio retention services. We expect to take further actions to achieve long-term sustained profitability for our remaining subservicing and portfolio retention business, including re-engineering our overhead and cost structure to allow our business to be properly supported, and to seek growth in our subservicing and portfolio retention businesses. Our ability to generate revenue from our subservicing and portfolio retention activities and complete the transition to our new business model is highly dependent on the success of our business relationships with our significant clients and our ability to attract new clients, both of which are impacted by our capability to adequately address the competitive challenges we may face.\nCompetition to service mortgage loans and for mortgage loan originations comes primarily from commercial banks and savings institutions, and non-bank mortgage originators and servicers. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and typically have access to greater financial resources. The competitive nature of the subservicing business creates certain challenges that we will need to manage, including natural runoff of servicing units, our existing significant client concentrations, and short-term contractual arrangements with certain clients which provide them with termination rights at any time without cause. Also, market factors such as higher interest rates, evolving regulations, and potentially volatile capital market conditions may adversely impact demand for MSRs by non-bank investors and create a more challenging environment for subservicing. Our performance is also subject to risks associated with the loss of client or customer confidence and demand, including those associated with any reputational damage from our legal and regulatory settlements and the intense scrutiny of our business. In addition, our success in attracting and retaining clients may be impacted by our continued efforts towards executing our remaining strategic actions, and our ability to demonstrate the viability of our remaining business and stability as a subservicing partner.\nTo achieve our financial objectives for our new business model, we need to realize our cost re-engineering reductions, subservicing growth, and portfolio retention recapture rate assumptions. There can be no assurances that we will execute these actions, or that the execution of these actions will achieve the intended results. The achievement of our goals is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally (including market, credit, operational, and legal and compliance risks) and the inherent difficulty associated with implementing these business objectives. Furthermore, our success is dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our management team and our ability to negotiate with third parties.\nThe amount of additional capital returned to shareholders, if any, as a result of our strategic actions may be less than our expectations. Furthermore, there can be no assurances about the method, timing or amounts of any such distributions.\nThere can be no assurances that we will return additional capital to shareholders, or that any amounts returned will be distributed in any prescribed time frame. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February 27, 2018 among Ocwen, POMS Corp and PHH, any distributions require the prior consent of Ocwen. The amount of capital available for distribution and the method and timing of such distributions, if any, will depend on several factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe execution of the sales of our private MSRs with New Residential, including the receipt of required approvals, the time required to obtain approvals, and the total proceeds realized based on the portfolio composition as of each future transfer date;\n\u2022\nour ability to monetize the remaining assets and liabilities of the PHH Home Loans entity and other residual assets;\n\u2022\nthe completion of our PLS exit, including the amounts of realized exit costs and operating losses, and our ability to substantially complete the exit of that business in our anticipated time frame;\n\u2022\nactual amounts of future cash outflows, including anticipated operating losses in the near term related to the transition to our new business model, costs incurred for transactions and restructuring, required payments for our unsecured term debt and any impacts from the Tax Act;\n\u2022\nthe outcomes of contingencies, including but not limited to MSR sale indemnifications and other contingencies, and the resolution of our outstanding legal and regulatory matters; and\n\u2022\nworking capital and contingent cash requirements of the remaining business.\nOur remaining business will be focused on subservicing and portfolio retention activities, and we have significant client concentration risk related to the percentage of subservicing and portfolio retention activities from agreements with New Residential Mortgage, LLC and Pingora Loan Servicing, LLC. Further, the terms of a significant portion of our subservicing agreements allow the owners of the servicing to terminate the subservicing agreement without cause which would also terminate any related portfolio defense agreements.\nOur subservicing portfolio is subject to runoff, meaning that the loans serviced by us under subservicing agreements may be repaid in full prior to maturity. Additionally, the owners of the servicing rights may elect to sell their MSRs related to some or all of the loans we subservice on their behalf, which could lead to a termination of our subservicing agreements with respect to such loans, resulting in a decrease in our revenues from subservicing. As a result, our subservicing portfolio will continue to shrink as our current additions through flow sales and portfolio retention are insufficient to offset the current level of runoff. Our ability to maintain the size of our subservicing portfolio depends on our ability to enter into agreements for additional subserviced populations with new or existing clients, and increase our portfolio retention recapture rates. Our portfolio retention business is exposed to the same client concentration and termination risks as subservicing described below, as our portfolio retention agreements cease upon the termination of the related client subservicing relationship, or as units transfer out of our subservicing portfolio to a new servicer. In addition, for the majority of our solicitable portfolio, we are authorized to seek refinance of mortgage loans on a non-exclusive basis, which may further limit our future mortgage loan originations since we must compete with other originators.\nWe have significant client concentration risk related to the percentage of our subservicing portfolio that are under agreements with a small group of key clients, and our portfolio retention agreements are limited to two significant subservicing clients. As of December 31, 2017, 58% and 19% of our subservicing portfolio (by units) related to significant client relationships with New Residential and Pingora Loan Servicing, LLC, respectively. Our subservicing agreement with New Residential became effective in June 2017 upon the initial transfer of MSRs under the sale agreement, and the subservicing agreement contains a three-year initial subservicing term. However, in addition to having the right to terminate the subservicing contract with respect to any MSRs sold by New Residential, New Residential has the right to transfer to another servicer, without cause, 25% of the subservicing units in the second year of the subservicing contract, and an additional 25% of the subservicing units in the third year of the contract. The terms of a substantial portion of our other subservicing agreements allow the owners of the servicing to terminate\nthe subservicing agreement without cause, or to otherwise significantly decrease the number of loans we subservice on their behalf, at any time, without cause, and with limited notice and negligible compensation. Additionally, from time to time, clients for whom we conduct subservicing activities could sell the mortgage servicing rights relating to some or all of the loans we subservice for such client, which could lead to a termination of our subservicing engagement with respect to such mortgage servicing rights and a decrease in our subservicing revenue. In recent periods, we have experienced client-driven reductions in our subservicing portfolio, and we expect the transfer of approximately 115,000 subservicing units off of our platform between May 2018 and April 2019, based upon receipt in February 2018 of formal notices and verbal indications from two of our largest subservicing clients. Approximately 65,000 of these units are subject to a portfolio retention agreement and will no longer be solicitable units upon transfer to a new servicer.\nAny terminations or material reductions in our subservicing portfolio would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur business is complex and heavily regulated, and there have been continual developments in regulations that impact our businesses. In addition, we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations, inquiries and proceedings, and we may incur fines, penalties, increased costs, and other consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows or damage our reputation. Any failure of ours to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the terms of agreements with regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local government authorities and may be subject to various judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions on how we conduct our business. These laws, regulations and judicial and administrative decisions include those pertaining to: real estate settlement procedures; fair lending; fair credit reporting; truth in lending; compliance with federal and state disclosure and licensing requirements; the establishment of maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; secured transactions; collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures; other trade practices; and privacy regulations providing for the use and safeguarding of non-public personal financial information of borrowers and guidance on non-traditional mortgage loans issued by the federal financial regulatory agencies. In addition, as an outcome of agreements or orders reached with government regulators, we have been, and may be further subject to, enhanced compliance monitoring, reporting requirements, changes to our business processes and procedures, and other agreements or obligations related to our origination and servicing activities. Further, by agreement with certain of our clients, we are required to comply with additional laws and regulations to which our clients may be subject. While we are not a bank, our business is subjected to both direct and indirect banking supervision (including examinations by certain of our clients' regulators).\nIn recent years, we have faced intense regulation and vigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory bodies. Legislatures and regulators have pursued a broad array of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer and investor protection, many of which have impacted us. Although the new presidential administration has indicated an intent to pursue the regulation of the financial services industry differently than was the case under the previous administration, there is significant uncertainty regarding the direction this presidential administration will take and its ability to implement its policies and objectives, as well as the ultimate impact on potential new regulatory initiatives and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations. In addition, there is uncertainty surrounding the impact changes in federal regulation may have on state and local authorities and administrative agencies and their oversight and enforcement, if any.\nConsistent with other mortgage originators and servicers, we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations, examinations, inquiries and proceedings from regulators and attorneys general of certain states as well as various governmental agencies, with respect to our mortgage lending and/or mortgage servicing practices. In addition, we are defendants in various legal proceedings, including private and civil litigation. Our legal and regulatory matters are at varying procedural stages and the ultimate resolution of any of these matters may result in: (i) adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions and other relief against us, including, without limitation, payments made in settlement arrangements, monetary payments; (ii) enhanced compliance requirements; (iii) changes in our business processes, procedures or agreements; (iv) limitations on our ability to pursue business strategies; or (v) other agreements and obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. For more information regarding our existing matters, see Note 13, 'Commitments and Contingencies' in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe expect the continued legislative and regulatory focus on mortgage origination and servicing practices will result in elevated legal, compliance and servicing-related costs, heightened risk for potential regulatory fines, penalties, and actions required for injunctive relief. There are currently pending numerous additional regulatory proposals, and other new initiatives are likely to be pursued in the future. The implementation of new regulatory requirements and/or limitations could further increase our compliance costs and risks associated with non-compliance, and any such developments may result in limitations on our ability to pursue business strategies or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our business. Regulatory investigations, inquiries and proceedings all require a significant amount of our time and resources to manage. The magnitude and complexity of our responses required to meet these demands requires the time and attention of our management, which poses a risk to achieving our business goals and priorities. Further, in our mortgage origination and servicing activities, we are exposed to operational risk and events of non-compliance resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or external events. While we maintain and update our systems and procedures to comply with applicable laws and regulations and devote resources towards managing, assessing and reacting to developments, there can be no assurances that these measures will be effective or that changes will be implemented by the required deadlines.\nA failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the terms of agreements with regulators could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of our approvals to engage in our origination and servicing businesses and/or other limitations on our ability to originate or service loans;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\ngovernment investigations, enforcement actions and litigation;\n\u2022\nan inability to execute on our business strategy or otherwise limit the activities we are permitted to engage in;\n\u2022\nrequired payments of fines, penalties, settlements or judgments; and/or\n\u2022\ninability to fund our business, or otherwise operate our business.\nAny of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are highly dependent upon programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, including our ability to sell mortgage loans. Changes in the servicing or origination guidelines required by the Agencies, or changes in these entities or their current roles, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur ability to generate revenues in our Mortgage Production and Servicing segments is highly dependent on programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae that facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. These entities play a powerful role in the residential mortgage industry, and we have significant business relationships with them, including:\nProduction. During 2017, 44% of our mortgage loan sales were sold to, or were sold pursuant to programs sponsored by, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. We also derive other material financial benefits from our relationships with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, which include the assumption of credit risk by these entities on loans included in mortgage-backed securities in exchange for our payment of guarantee fees, the ability to avoid certain loan inventory finance costs through streamlined loan funding and sale procedures and the use of mortgage warehouse facilities with Fannie Mae.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have remained in conservatorship and a path forward to emerge from conservatorship is unclear. These roles could be reduced, modified or eliminated and the nature of their guarantees could be limited or eliminated relative to historical measurements. Furthermore, any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these Agencies, any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the primary or secondary mortgage markets or in the underwriting criteria of these Agencies could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nServicing. We service loans on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as loans that have been securitized pursuant to securitization programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. As of December 31, 2017, 57% of our mortgage servicing rights and loans serviced through subservicing agreements pertain to these programs, and we are subject to the servicing guidelines set by these Agencies.\nOur status as a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae approved seller/servicer is subject to compliance with each entity\u2019s respective selling and servicing guidelines and failure to meet such guidelines could result in the unilateral termination of our status as an approved seller/servicer. We cannot negotiate these terms with the Agencies and they are subject to change at any\ntime. A significant change in these guidelines that has the effect of decreasing the fees we charge or requires us to expend additional resources in providing mortgage servicing could decrease our revenues or increase our costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, changes in the nature or extent of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the insurance provided by the FHA could have broad adverse market implications. The fees that we are required to pay to the Agencies for these guarantees have changed significantly over time and any future increases in these fees would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain our relationship with each of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae would result in the termination of many of our agreements with our private label and subservicing clients and otherwise would materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur mortgage asset-backed debt arrangements, a significant portion of which are short-term agreements, are an important source of our liquidity. If any of our funding arrangements are terminated, not renewed or otherwise become unavailable to us, we may be unable to find replacement financing on economically viable terms, if at all. If a substantial portion of such arrangements are terminated, not renewed, and cannot be replaced, it would adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nOur mortgage asset-backed debt arrangements are an important source of liquidity for our origination and servicing activities.\nOur mortgage warehouse facilities support the origination of mortgage loans, which provide creditors a collateralized interest in specific mortgage loans that meet the eligibility requirements under the terms of the facility. Our mortgage warehouse facilities have historically had up to a 364-day term; however, throughout 2017, we entered into shorter term facilities with certain lenders to allow us and the lender to evaluate facility needs and agreement terms that would be appropriate for our new business model after the completion of our strategic actions. In addition, certain facilities require us to maintain a specified amount of available funding from other facilities. As such, our liquidity profile and compliance with debt covenants depends on our ability to renew multiple facilities within a short time frame.\nDuring 2017, we have experienced significant changes to our business profile, liquidity and capital structure and funding requirements driven by our strategic actions and transitions to our new business model, including changes in our mortgage origination volumes driven by the sales of or exit from certain businesses. As such, our ability to renew our mortgage warehouse facilities may be more limited than our historical experience as lenders continually assess PHH and its subsidiaries as counterparties as a smaller company, or we may be unable to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nFurther, our access to and our ability to renew our existing mortgage warehouse facilities is subject to prevailing market conditions, and could suffer in the event of: (i) the deterioration in the performance of the mortgage loans underlying the warehouse facilities; (ii) our failure to maintain sufficient levels of eligible assets or credit enhancements or comply with other terms of the facilities; (iii) our inability to access the secondary market for mortgage loans; and (iv) termination of our role as servicer of the underlying mortgage assets.\nOur servicing advance facility, PHH Servicer Advance Receivables Trust (\u201cPSART\u201d), is a special purpose bankruptcy remote trust formed for purposes of issuing non-recourse asset-backed notes secured by servicing advance receivables. Our ability to maintain liquidity through issuing asset-backed notes secured by servicing advance receivables is dependent on many factors, including but not limited to: (i) market demand for ABS, specifically ABS collateralized by mortgage servicing-related receivables; (ii) our ability to service in accordance with applicable guidelines and the quality of our servicing, both of which will impact noteholders\u2019 willingness to commit to financing for an additional term; and (iii) our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to us.\nIf a substantial portion of the committed capacity of our facilities are terminated or are not renewed, we may be unable to find replacement financing on commercially favorable terms, if at all, which could adversely impact our operations and prevent us from executing our business plan, originating new mortgage loans or fulfilling commitments made in the ordinary course of business. These factors could reduce revenues attributable to our business activities or require us to sell assets at below market prices, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our transition to a new business model with a different capital structure than historical levels, may result in us being more reliant on asset-backed debt arrangements to fund our operations.\nCertain of our debt arrangements require us to comply with specific financial covenants and other affirmative and restrictive covenants, termination events, conditions precedent to borrowing, and other restrictions, including, but not limited to, those relating to material adverse changes, our consolidated net worth, liquidity, and leverage. An uncured default of one or more of these covenants could result in a cross-default between and amongst our asset-backed debt arrangements. Consequently, an uncured default that is not waived by our lenders and that results in an acceleration of amounts payable to our lenders or the termination\nof credit facilities would materially and adversely impact our liquidity, could force us to sell assets at below market prices to repay our indebtedness, and could force us to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate risk.\nIn our Mortgage Production segment, we currently use derivative financial instruments, primarily forward delivery commitments, to manage exposure to interest rate risk and related price risk of our origination pipeline and related assets, including interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. However, no hedging strategy can protect us completely. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. Our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not be able to adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility, and our hedging transactions may result in or magnify losses. Furthermore, interest rate derivatives may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly during economic downturns.\nDue to the significant changes to our business profile, liquidity and capital structure driven by our strategic actions and transition to our new business model that occurred during 2017, our liquidity and ability to trade may be more limited than our historical experience, as hedging participants may be unwilling to trade or execute loan sales with us on substantially similar terms to our historical experience. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur decision to return cash to shareholders through stock repurchases has reduced our market capitalization and may not prove to be the best use of our capital.\nDuring 2017, we repurchased 21,213,428 shares of Common stock for an aggregate $301 million through an open market repurchase program and modified \"Dutch\" auction tender offer. These repurchases reduced our market capitalization and public float, which is the number of shares of our Common stock that are owned by non-affiliated stockholders and available for trading in the securities markets, which may reduce the volume of trading in our shares and result in reduced liquidity and volatility in our stock price. The market price of our Common stock has been and may continue to be volatile which may affect your ability to sell our Common stock at an advantageous price. For example, the closing market price of our Common stock on the New York Stock Exchange fluctuated between $10.09 per share and $15.53 per share during 2017 and may continue to fluctuate. Market price fluctuations in our Common stock may be due to factors both within and outside of our control, including our strategic actions, industry and regulatory matters or other material public announcements, as well as a variety of additional factors including, without limitation, those set forth under these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nIn November 2017, our Board of Directors provided a new authorization for up to $100 million of share repurchases. We have no obligation to repurchase shares under this authorization, and any share repurchase program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February 27, 2018 among Ocwen, POMS Corp and PHH, any share repurchases require the prior consent of Ocwen.\nAny repurchases would utilize cash that we will not be able to use in other ways, or to meet other potential demands, and may not prove to be the best use of our capital. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase any, or the full amount authorized under any share repurchase program, or that any past or future repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price.\nA change in control transaction may result in a number of significant cash outflows that could reduce the value of our business. Further, the provisions of certain of our agreements could discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us, or could prevent or delay a transaction resulting in a change of control.\nThe net proceeds realized by our shareholders as the result of any change in control transaction or a fundamental change to our businesses, may be negatively impacted as a result of required payments under our debt arrangements or the potential termination of certain client relationships (if consents or waivers are not obtained), among other consequences. Further, a change of control may constitute an event of default under certain of our debt agreements, including our mortgage warehouse facilities.\nWe may need to obtain consents or waivers from the GSEs, state licensing agencies and certain clients or counterparties, in connection with certain change in control transactions. Additionally, the value of our business could be reduced from any lost relationships and/or loss of our approved status as a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae approved seller/servicer in connection with certain change in control transactions. Our agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require us to provide notice or\nobtain approvals or consents related to any change in control transaction. The need to obtain waivers or consents from our clients in connection with a change in control transaction may discourage certain third parties from seeking to acquire us or could reduce or delay our receipt of the amount of consideration they would be willing to pay to our stockholders in an acquisition transaction, or could otherwise reduce the value of the business when separated.\nProvisions in our charter documents, the Maryland General Corporation Law, and New York insurance law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.\nOur charter and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions include, among other things, advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings and \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Blank check preferred stock enables our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, as our Board of Directors may determine, including rights to dividends and proceeds in a liquidation that are senior to the Common stock.\nWe are also subject to certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law which could delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their Common stock or may otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. These include, among other provisions:\n\u2022\nthe \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d statute which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder; and\n\u2022\nthe \u201ccontrol share\u201d acquisition statute which provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\nOur by-laws contain a provision exempting any share of our capital stock from the control share acquisition statute to the fullest extent permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law. However, our Board of Directors has the exclusive right to amend our by-laws and, subject to their fiduciary duties, could at any time in the future amend the by-laws to remove this exemption provision.\nIn addition, we are registered as an insurance holding company in the state of New York as a result of our wholly owned subsidiary, Atrium Insurance Corporation. New York insurance law requires regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurer or an insurer\u2019s holding company. Accordingly, there can be no effective change in control of us unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the New York state insurance regulators and has obtained prior approval. The measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to New York law is the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock or other ownership interest of an insurance company or its parent. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.\nOther Risks\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates made by our management, including those used in determining the fair values of a substantial portion of our assets. If the assumptions or estimates are subsequently proven incorrect or inaccurate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we utilize certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including but not limited to, when determining the fair values of certain assets and liabilities, accruals related to litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, and reserves related to mortgage representations and warranty claims. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience significant losses as the ultimate realization of value may be materially different than the amounts reflected in our consolidated statement of financial position as of any particular date.\nFor additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nFair Value. A substantial portion of our assets are recorded at fair value based upon significant estimates and assumptions with changes in fair value included in our consolidated results of operations. We use models that utilize, wherever possible, market data to value certain of our assets, including but not limited to our MSRs, newly originated loans held for sale and MSR secured liability. Further, we utilize fair value measurements in our review of the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment.\nThe determination of the fair value of our assets involves numerous estimates and assumptions made by our management, many of which are beyond our control. Such estimates and assumptions include, without limitation, estimates of future cash flows associated with our Mortgage servicing rights based upon model inputs involving interest rates as well as the prepayment rates and delinquencies and foreclosure rates of the underlying serviced mortgage loans. The use of different estimates or assumptions in connection with the valuation of these assets could produce materially different fair values, or our fair value estimates may not be realized in an actual sale or settlement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Contingencies. Accruals are established for pending or threatened litigation, claims or assessments when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and other legal proceedings, it is not always possible to determine a reasonable estimate of the amount of a probable loss, and we may estimate a range of possible loss for consideration in these estimates. The estimates are based upon currently available information and involve significant judgment taking into account the varying stages and inherent uncertainties of such matters. Accordingly, our estimates may change from time to time and such changes may be material to our consolidated results of operations. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of such matters will not result in losses in excess of our recorded accruals, or in excess of our estimate of reasonably possible losses, and the ultimate settlement of such matters may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRepresentations and Warranties. In connection with the sale of mortgage loans, we make various representations and warranties that, if breached, require us to repurchase the loans or indemnify the purchaser for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. The estimation of our loan repurchase and indemnification liability requires subjective and complex judgments, and incorporates key assumptions that are impacted by both internal and external factors. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, the level of loan sales and origination volumes, and the quality of our underwriting procedures. External factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the political environment and oversight of the Agencies, and related changes in Agency programs and guidelines; (ii) borrower delinquency levels and default patterns; (iii) home price values and (iv) the overall economic condition of borrowers and the U.S. economy. There can be no assurance that we will not realize losses in excess of our recorded reserves, or in excess of our estimate of reasonably possible losses, and that such losses may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur reliance on outsourcing arrangements for information technology and other services subjects us to significant business process and control risks due to the complexity of our information systems or if our outsourcing counterparties do not meet their obligations to us.\nWe outsource certain information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) and other services to third parties which subjects us to significant business process and control risks. If our outsource partners fail to perform their obligations under the terms of the agreements, or if our management of these vendors is not successful, we are subject to operational risk from our IT environment. We are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use to interface with our customers, to maintain compliance with applicable regulations and to manage our internal financial and other systems. Our business model and our reputation as a service provider to our clients, as well as our internal controls over financial reporting, are highly dependent upon these systems and processes. In addition, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on our technology infrastructure.\nAlthough we have service-level arrangements with our counterparties, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable to their performance failures. Any failures in our technology systems, processes or the related internal and operational controls, or the failure of our outsourcing providers to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in the loss of client relationships, damage to our reputation, failures to comply with regulations, failure to prepare our financial statements in a timely and accurate manner, and increased costs, the result of any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nDuring 2016, we elected to terminate certain IT outsourcing agreements with our existing third party, and we intend to transition such services to our own systems and processes, or certain functions to a new third party by the first quarter of 2018. We face risks related to our ability to successfully transition the performance of these processes and the related internal and operational controls, and in enhancing our internal processes to support the functions that may have been previously outsourced. We may\nincur costs in connection with this transition that we may not have incurred, other than for our decision to end this outsourcing relationship.\nA failure in or breach of our technology infrastructure or information protection programs, or those of our outsource providers, could result in the inadvertent disclosure of the confidential personal information of our customers, as well as the confidential personal information of the customers of our clients. Any such failure or breach, including as a result of cyber-attacks against us or our outsource partners, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business model and our reputation as a service provider to our clients are dependent upon our ability to safeguard the confidential personal information of our customers, as well as the confidential personal information of the customers of our clients. Although we have put in place, and require our outsource providers to follow, a comprehensive information security program that we monitor and update as needed, security breaches could occur through intentional or unintentional acts by individuals having authorized or unauthorized access to confidential information of our customers or the employees or customers of our clients which could potentially compromise confidential information processed and stored in or transmitted through our technology infrastructure. In addition, we have highly complex information systems, certain portions of which we are dependent upon third party outsource providers and other portions of which are self-developed and for which third party support is not generally available.\nThe cybersecurity regulatory environment is evolving, and it is possible that the costs to us and the resources required for complying with new or developing regulatory requirements will increase. Specifically, the New York Department of Financial Services (\"NYDFS\") issued final Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies that requires financial services and other institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including us, to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State\u2019s financial services industry. It is possible that similar laws and regulations may be enacted in the future in other jurisdictions and failure to comply with these obligations can give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, a failure in or breach of the security of our information systems, or those of our outsource providers, or a cyber-attack against us or our outsource partners, could result in significant damage to our reputation or the reputation of our clients, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients and could result in increased costs attributable to related litigation or regulatory actions, claims for indemnification, higher insurance premiums and remediation activities, the result of any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 90531, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "PHH"}
