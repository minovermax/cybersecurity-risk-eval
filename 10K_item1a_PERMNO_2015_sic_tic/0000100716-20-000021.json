{"cik": "100716", "company": "UNICO AMERICAN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s securities involves a high degree of risk. The Company operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that the Company does not currently consider material, may impair the Company\u2019s business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the value of the Company\u2019s securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nCrusader is subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and any failure to meet these requirements could subject Crusader to regulatory action.\nCrusader is subject to RBC standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable laws of its state of domicile. The RBC standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require Crusader to report the results of RBC calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. If Crusader fails to meet these standards and requirements, the CA DOI may require specified actions to be taken, which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s competitiveness, operational flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes and other catastrophic events, particularly hurricanes, earthquakes, hail storms, explosions, tropical storms, fires, sinkholes, war, acts of terrorism, severe winter weather and other natural and man-made disasters. Such events typically increase the frequency and severity of commercial property claims. Because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations, and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in substantial volatility in the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations from period to period. In addition, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of issuers of obligations the Company holds in its investment portfolio, resulting in impairments to these investments, and the financial condition of the Company\u2019s reinsurers, thereby increasing the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Although the Company attempts to manage its exposure to such events, the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and could result in substantial outflows of cash as losses are paid.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS CoV-2, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. As of March 2020, the novel coronavirus has spread to other countries, including the United States, as has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus have intensified, including severe travel restrictions imposed by the U.S. government related to China and Europe. The outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that the Company, its clients, their respective suppliers, or governments may take in respect of this coronavirus may disrupt the Company\u2019s business and the business of its clients. The Company is diligently working to ensure that it can operate with minimal disruption, and to mitigate the impact of the outbreak on its employees\u2019 health and safety. However, given the interconnectivity of the global economy and the possible rate of future global transmission, the full extent to which the coronavirus pandemic could affect the global economy is unknown and its impact may extend beyond the areas which are currently known to be impacted. Any resulting financial impact will depend on future developments and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but may materially affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nPage 15 of 82\nAdditionally, the continued spread of the coronavirus has led to severe disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital and debt markets, and adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio. It is possible that the continued spread of the coronavirus could cause an economic slowdown or recession (which could adversely affect the demand for the Company\u2019s insurance products and increase delinquencies and defaults by its customers) or cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, the Company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes the Company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the Company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success may depend on its ability to adjust claims accurately.\nMany factors can affect the Company\u2019s ability to adjust claims accurately, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe training, experience, and skill of the Company\u2019s claims representatives,\n\u2022\ncontinued access to independent or outside adjusters,\n\u2022\nthe extent of fraudulent or inflated claims and the Company\u2019s ability to recognize and respond to,such claims\n\u2022\nthe claims organization\u2019s culture and the effectiveness of its management, and\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support claims functions.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and the Company\u2019s reputation in the marketplace, impair its brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect its competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity.\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on estimates and may not be sufficient to cover future losses.\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured events that have occurred, including events that have occurred but have not yet been reported to Crusader. If claims exceed the related reserves, the Company may not have sufficient funds available to satisfy all such claims, and in any event, the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. There is a high level of uncertainty inherent in the evaluation of the required loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for Crusader. The long-tailed nature of liability claims and the volatility of jury awards exacerbate that uncertainty. The difficulty in estimating the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves contributed to adverse development of insured events of prior years in the amount of $3,191,185 which Crusader experienced in 2019. Crusader sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date based upon management\u2019s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and related loss adjustment expenses incurred as of that date for both reported and unreported losses. The ultimate cost of claims is dependent upon future events, the outcomes of which are affected by many factors. Crusader claim reserving procedures and settlement philosophy, current and perceived social and economic inflation, current and future court rulings and jury attitudes, improvements in medical technology, and many other economic, scientific, legal, political, and social factors all can have significant effects on the ultimate costs of claims. Changes in Crusader operations and management philosophy also may cause actual developments to vary from the past. Since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made.\nPage 16 of 82\nChanges in federal or state tax laws could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are dependent, in part, on tax policy implemented at the federal and/or state level. The Company\u2019s results are also subject to federal and state tax rules applicable to dividends received from its subsidiaries. Additionally, changes in tax laws could have an adverse effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. The Company cannot predict whether any tax legislation will be enacted in the near future or whether any such changes to existing federal or state tax law would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAny inability of the Company to realize its deferred tax assets may have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases, and for tax credits. The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability, reversal patterns of recorded deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, and capital gain generation. Although management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, some or all of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets could expire unused if the Company is unable to generate taxable income of a sufficient nature in the future to utilize them.\nIf the Company determines it is more-likely-than-not that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would reduce the deferred tax asset through a charge to earnings in the period in which the determination is made. This charge could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the assumptions used to make this determination are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between the Company\u2019s projected operating performance and actual results. As a result, management\u2019s judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nThe Company may be negatively impacted by emerging claim and coverage issues.\nAs insurance industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge, including new or expanded theories of liability. This phenomenon is generally referred to as \u201csocial inflation.\u201d These or other changes could impose new financial obligations on the Company by extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or otherwise require the Company to make unplanned modifications to the products and services that the Company provides, or cause the delay or cancellation of products and services that the Company provides. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nJudicial expansion of policy coverage and a greater propensity to grant claimants more favorable amounts and the impact of new theories of liability.\n\u2022\nPlaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including the Company, in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices.\n\u2022\nSocial inflation trends, including higher and more frequent claims, more favorable judgments and legislated increases.\n\u2022\nMedical developments that link health issues to particular causes, resulting in liability claims.\n\u2022\nClaims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies, including cyber security related risks.\n\u2022\nClaims relating to potentially changing climate conditions.\n\u2022\nIncreased claims due to third party funding of litigation.\nIn some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after the Company has issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under the Company\u2019s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued. For example, social changes and litigation trends have resulted in significantly larger verdicts awarded by juries in recent years in connection with altercations in bars and taverns, and in significantly larger settlements on cases which do not go to trial in connection with tenants-rights, rent-control, property-utilization and property-maintenance laws, as well as other forms of social inflation, and these trends may continue. In addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nPage 17 of 82\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premium to policyholders.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations largely depend on the Company\u2019s ability to underwrite and set premium accurately for the risks it faces. Premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. In order to price its products accurately, the Company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. The Company\u2019s ability to undertake these efforts successfully is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nAvailability of sufficient reliable data.\n\u2022\nIncorrect or incomplete analysis of available data.\n\u2022\nUncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions.\n\u2022\nSelection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies.\n\u2022\nAdoption of successful pricing strategies.\n\u2022\nPrediction of policyholder retention (e.g., policy life expectancy).\n\u2022\nUnanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action.\n\u2022\nOngoing changes in the Company\u2019s claim settlement practices.\n\u2022\nUnexpected inflation.\n\u2022\nSocial changes, particularly those affecting litigation patterns.\nSuch risks may result in the Company\u2019s pricing being based on outdated, inadequate, or inaccurate data, or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause the Company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, the Company could underprice risks, which would negatively affect the Company\u2019s margins, or it could overprice risks, which could reduce the Company\u2019s volume and competitiveness. The Company\u2019s ability to accurately underwrite risks in insurance contracts depends in part on its ability to forecast such changes and trends. If it is not successful in doing so, the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nInability to obtain reinsurance or to collect ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses could adversely affect Crusader\u2019s ability to write new policies.\nThe availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly. Any decrease in the amount of Crusader\u2019s reinsurance will increase the risk of loss and could materially adversely affect its business and financial condition. Ceded reinsurance does not discharge Crusader\u2019s direct obligations under the policies it writes. Crusader remains liable to its policyholders even if it is unable to make recoveries that it believes it is entitled to under the reinsurance contracts. Losses may not be recovered from the reinsurers until claims are paid, which may create timing and liquidity risk. Additionally, any losses in excess of Crusader\u2019s reinsurance limits would remain direct obligations of Crusader and would therefore have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2017, Crusader settled a claim which incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of its reinsurance limits.\nThe insurance business is subject to extensive regulation and such regulation may become more extensive in the future, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCrusader is subject to extensive regulations and supervision in the states in which it operates or is licensed to conduct business. These regulations are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their stockholders or other investors. The regulations relate to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and nonfinancial components of an insurance company\u2019s business. These powers include, among other things, the ability to:\n\u2022\nPlace limitations on Crusader\u2019s investments and dividends.\n\u2022\nPlace limitations on Crusader\u2019s ability to transact business with its affiliates.\n\u2022\nEstablish standards of solvency including minimum reserves and capital surplus requirements.\n\u2022\nPrescribe the form and content of and to examine Crusader\u2019s financial statements.\nFederal legislation currently does not directly impact the property and casualty business, but the business can be indirectly affected by changes in federal regulations. From time to time, the U.S. Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. The Company cannot predict whether, and to what extent, new laws and regulations that would affect its business will be adopted, the timing of any such adoption and what effects, if any, they may have on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company is unable to predict whether such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent this could affect the Company.\nPage 18 of 82\nCrusader, along with other licensed insurers, is required to bear a portion of the losses suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies. In addition, Crusader must participate in mandatory arrangements to provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers. The effect of these and similar arrangements could reduce its profitability in any given period or limit its ability to grow the business. The NAIC and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations.\nMany states have adopted measures related to the NAIC\u2019s Solvency Modernization Initiative (\u201cSMI\u201d), which have included model regulations that require insurers to summarize their key risks and risk management strategies to regulators. The SMI resulted in a 2010 amendment to the NAIC\u2019s Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act, which requires the ultimate controlling person in an insurer\u2019s holding company structure to identify and report material enterprise risks to the state insurance regulator. The SMI also produced the NAIC Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Model Act (\u201cORSA\u201d), which requires insurers meeting premium thresholds to maintain a risk management framework, and annually submit a comprehensive report designed to assess the adequacy of an insurer\u2019s risk management practices, including risks related to the insurer\u2019s future solvency position. The Company is currently exempt from providing an ORSA summary report as it does not meet the minimum premium requirements. On the federal level, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, mandated significant changes to the regulation of U.S. insurance effective as of July 21, 2011. Currently, the impact of these regulations has not materially affected the Company\u2019s business. Any proposed or future state or federal legislation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on the ability of Crusader to conduct business and/or may result in higher costs.\nThe extensive regulation to which the Company is subject may affect the cost of or demand for the Company\u2019s products and may limit the ability to obtain rate increases or to take other actions that the Company might desire to do in order to increase its profitability.\nUnico is a holding company that relies on its subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations.\nAs a holding company, Unico does not generate revenue sufficient to pay operating expenses or stockholders\u2019 dividends. Consequently, Unico relies on the ability of its subsidiaries to meet its obligations. The ability of Crusader to pay dividends to Unico is regulated by state insurance laws, which limit the amount of, and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of, cash dividends. The inability of Crusader to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable Unico to meet its cash requirements could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nPast and future downgrades in the financial strength rating or long-term issuer credit rating of Crusader could reduce the amount of business it may be able to write.\nRating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength as an indication of an ability to pay claims. The financial strength rating of A.M. Best is subject to periodic review using, among other things, proprietary capital adequacy models and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Insurance financial strength ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agents and are not intended for the protection of investors. Crusader and Unico have experienced downgrades in such ratings in the past, and may experience further downgrades in the future. Any downgrade in Crusader\u2019s A.M. Best rating could cause a reduction in the number of policies it writes and could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nOn January 17, 2019, A.M. Best Company downgraded Crusader\u2019s Financial Strength Rating to B++ (Good) from A- (Excellent) and its Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (Long-Term ICR\u201d) to bbb+ from a-. The outlook of the Financial Strength Rating was revised at that time to stable from negative while the outlook of the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating remained negative. The rating downgrades reflected a revision in A.M. Best\u2019s assessment of Crusader\u2019s operating performance to adequate from strong.\nPage 19 of 82\nOn January 30, 2020, A.M. Best Company affirmed Crusader\u2019s Financial Strength Rating of B++ (Good) and further downgraded Crusader\u2019s Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (\u201cLong-Term ICR\u201d) to \u201cbbb\u201d from \u201cbbb+\u201d. The outlook of the FSR of Crusader remains stable while the outlook of the Long-Term ICR of Crusader was revised to stable from negative. Also on January 30, 2020, A.M Best downgraded the Long-Term ICR of Unico to \u201cbb\u201d from \u201cbb+\u201d. The outlook of the Long-Term ICR of Unico was revised to stable from negative.\nThe ratings reflect Crusader\u2019s balance sheet strength, which A.M. Best categorizes as very strong, as well as its marginal operating performance, limited business profile and marginal enterprise risk management. The downgrade of the Long-Term ICR reflects a revision in A.M. Best\u2019s assessment of Crusader\u2018s operating performance to marginal from adequate. According to A.M. Best, (i) the downgrades consider a material decline in Crusader\u2019s operating performance, resulting from sub-par underwriting results in a relatively compact time frame, (ii) Crusader\u2019s adverse performance has been amplified by increased frequency and severity of apartment building insurance related claims, (iii) multiple operating metrics of Crusader trail the commercial casualty composite on a five-year and 10-year basis, and (iv) the consequential business changes being implemented to address these conditions lead to significant execution risk in returning Crusader\u2019s operational results to historical levels.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates.\nInvestment income is an important component of the Company\u2019s revenues and net income. The ability to achieve investment objectives is affected by factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Many of the instruments in which the Company may invest are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Any significant decline in investment income as a result of falling interest rates or general market conditions may have an adverse effect on net income and, as a result, on the Company\u2019s stockholders' equity and statutory surplus.\nThe outlook for the Company\u2019s investment income is dependent on the composition of its investment portfolio, the future direction of interest rates and the amount of cash flows from operations that are available for investment. The fair values of fixed maturity investments that are \"available-for-sale\" fluctuate with changes in interest rates and cause fluctuations in stockholders' equity.\nThe Company\u2019s investments may be subject to credit, prepayment and other risks.\nThe Company\u2019s investment guidelines allow investing in new classes of securities which are subject to additional risks. Rating errors by agencies, such as Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s, and Fitch, and/or economic downturn may create credit risk, a decline in interest rates may create prepayment risk, and a decrease in tax rates may reduce attractiveness of state and municipal bonds and may impact their market valuation. Any significant loss on investments or general market downturn may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s stockholders' equity and statutory surplus and its business.\nThe Company\u2019s geographic concentration ties its performance to the business, economic, and regulatory conditions in California.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance business is concentrated in California (99.9% and 99.8% of direct written premium (before reinsurance ceded) in 2019 and 2018, respectively). Accordingly, unfavorable business, economic or regulatory conditions in the state of California could negatively impact the Company\u2019s performance. In addition, California is exposed to severe natural perils, such as earthquakes and fires along with the possibility of terrorist acts. Accordingly, the Company could suffer losses as a result of catastrophic events, and such losses could be magnified as a result of its business concentration in California.\nThe Company\u2019s single operating location exposes it to geographic risk.\nThe Company conducts its business from a single facility located in the Calabasas building. The Company may not be able to access the building due to natural disasters, civil unrests, closures of public roads or utilities, or other unforeseen events. While the Company has procedures and insurance in place to mitigate short-term access limitations to the building, an extended building access limitation may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operation.\nThe Company relies on independent insurance agents and brokers.\nThe failure or inability of independent insurance agents and brokers to market the Company\u2019s insurance programs successfully could have a materially adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Independent brokers are not obligated to promote the Company\u2019s insurance programs and may sell competitors' insurance programs. The Company\u2019s business largely depends on the marketing efforts of independent brokers and on the Company\u2019s ability to offer insurance programs and services that meet the requirements of the customers of those brokers.\nPage 20 of 82\nThe Company\u2019s reserve for doubtful accounts is based on estimates.\nThe Company may not be able to collect the premiums it estimates are collectible from its agents and brokers and, therefore, the Company\u2019s reserve for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.\nLitigation may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s is routinely involved in litigation, which can be unpredictable and costly, and may result in negative effects on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. By virtue of the nature of its business, the Company is subject to numerous legal proceedings in which it may be named as either plaintiff or defendant. Such disputes may concern the issuance or non-issuance of individual insurance policies, coverage disputes or other matters. In addition, the insurance industry is the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial and/or indeterminate amounts and the outcomes of which are unpredictable. This litigation can be based on a variety of issues including insurance and claim settlement practices. Although the Company has not been the target of any specific class action lawsuits, it is possible that a lawsuit of this type could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe exclusions and limitations in the Company\u2019s policies may not be enforceable.\nMany of the Company\u2019s policies include exclusions or other conditions that define and limit coverage; these exclusions and conditions are designed to manage the Company\u2019s exposure to certain types of risks and expanding theories of legal liability. In addition, many of the Company\u2019s policies limit the period during which a policyholder may bring a claim under the policy; this period in many cases is shorter than the statutory period under which these claims can be brought by the policyholders. While these exclusions and limitations help the Company assess and control its loss exposure, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions and limitations. This could result in higher than anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses by extending coverage beyond the Company\u2019s underwriting intent or increasing the number or size of claims, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after the Company has issued the insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under the Company\u2019s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued.\nThe Company relies on its information technology systems, and the data it maintains within those systems, to manage many aspects of its business. Cybersecurity risks, the failure of these systems to operate properly, and/or the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of policyholder and claims data, including personal identifying information, could result in a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company collects and retains large volumes of internal and policyholder data, including personal identifying information. The Company uses this information for a variety of business purposes, including but not limited to underwriting, claims, billing, and administration. The Company also collects and retains the personal identifying information of its employees and job applicants. The Company therefore depends on the security, accuracy, reliability, and proper functioning of its information technology systems, many of which contain the personal identifying information of its policyholders, employees, and job applicants, to effectively manage many aspects of its business, including underwriting, policy acquisition, claims processing and handling, accounting, reserving and actuarial processes and policies, job applications, employee management, and maintaining its policyholder data.\nThe failure of hardware or software that supports the Company\u2019s information technology systems or the loss of data contained in the systems could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums, increased overhead costs, and inaccurate reporting, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the Company\u2019s information technology systems, these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from events such as:\n\u2022\nEarthquake, fire, flood, and other natural disasters.\n\u2022\nTerrorism acts and attacks by computer viruses or hackers.\n\u2022\nPower loss.\n\u2022\nUnauthorized access.\n\u2022\nComputer systems or data network failure.\nPage 21 of 82\nIt is possible that a system failure, accident, security breach, or unauthorized internal or external knowledge, or misuse of confidential Company data could result in a material disruption to the Company\u2019s business and reputation, as well as an increased risk of remedial and other expenses, fines, or lawsuits.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, AAQHC concluded an investigation regarding potential unauthorized access to non-public personal information as a result of a vulnerability in AAQHC\u2019s website. The investigation identified non-public personal information pertaining to approximately 15 individuals that likely were accessed without authorization. The vulnerability has been remediated, the affected individuals are being notified, and will be offered complimentary credit monitoring services. AAQHC is also in the process of notifying its vendor related to this incident, which may trigger additional inquiries and potential lawsuits. While the incident is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, it may increase the risk associated with future incidents, investigations, and lawsuits, particularly the risk of damage to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nAlthough the Company seeks to mitigate the impact and severity of potential cyber threats more generally, not every risk or liability can be mitigated against. To the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner, the Company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the costs associated with the development or acquisition of new computer software, such as in the case of the Company\u2019s planned replacement of its policy administration system, may result in impairment charges if such acquisition or development is not successfully implemented. Any such impairment charges may adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operation.\nIn conducting its business, the Company also uses various third party vendors and service providers. These service providers and the systems they utilize are typically subject to the same types of security-related risks the Company faces. The Company provides certain of these vendors with data, including non-public personal identifying information. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s due diligence or ongoing vendor oversight will be sufficient to ensure the integrity and security of the systems used by these vendors or the protection of information that resides thereon. Adverse consequences for the Company in the event of a significant event involving the systems of its vendors or the information provided to the vendors, among others, could delay the Company\u2019s delivery of products and services, result in a direct or indirect financial loss, and/or result in loss of business and/or reputational damage.\nThe legal and regulatory environment governing data privacy and security is becoming increasingly complex, and continues to evolve. Certain laws and contracts that the Company enters into require it to notify various parties, including consumers or customers, in the event of certain actual or potential data breaches or systems failures, including those of our service providers. These notifications can result, among other things, in the loss of customers, lawsuits, adverse publicity, diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, the attention of regulatory authorities, fines, and disruptions in sales. Data privacy laws, such as the CCPA, HIPAA, and the IIPPA, further present additional compliance challenges regarding notice, responding to consumer requests, and securing covered data adequately. Maintaining compliance with applicable data privacy and security laws and regulations may increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and adversely impact its ability to market products and service policyholders. Any inability to prevent or adequately respond to these legal and regulatory challenges could disrupt the Company\u2019s business, inhibit its ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, otherwise harm its reputation and/or result in financial losses, litigation, increased costs, or other adverse consequences that could be material to the Company.\nThe Company has experienced delays and cost overruns in connection with the upgrade of its legacy information technology system.\nIn 2018, the Company identified the need to replace or upgrade its legacy information technology system to process its smaller premium accounts more efficiently. At that time, the Company determined that the cost to replace its legacy IT system would be between $4 million and $8 million, and the installation of such a system would take between two to four years. After weighing the time and expense involved against the anticipated benefit from such an investment, the Company opted for what it then perceived to be a less expensive upgrade to its legacy system, an upgrade that then seemed to offer more incremental benefits in a shorter timeframe. While initially expected to be completed by the end of 2019, the system upgrade is now expected to be completed by the end of 2020, due to unexpected technical challenges. The Company has also experienced repeated cost overruns in connection with the system upgrade, which have adversely impacted the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company believes that the failure to have replaced or upgraded its legacy information technology system has contributed to its operating losses in recent years. If the Company experiences further delays or cost overruns, its results of operations may be adversely affected in future periods.\nPage 22 of 82\nThe Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud.\nThe Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. The Company\u2019s management believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and the Company cannot ensure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nChanges in general economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by national and local economic conditions, such as recessions, increased levels of unemployment, inflation and the disruption in the financial markets. The Company is not able to predict the effect of these factors or their duration and severity.\nThe Company depends on key personnel, the loss of which could negatively impact its business.\nThe Company\u2019s current and future success is dependent to a large extent on the retention and continued service of its key personnel, which includes its executive officers. The loss or unavailability of any key personnel, which includes its executive officers, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ability of the Company to attract, develop and retain employees and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to the Company\u2019s success.\nThe Company must hire and train new employees and retain current employees to handle its operations. The failure of the Company to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled employees could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties that have significant contracts or relationships with the Company become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or services arrangements. These include, for example, contracts for the acquisition of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to its operations), agreements with independent or outside claim adjusters, agreements with other insurance carriers to sell products that the Company does not offer, and arrangements for transferring certain risks (including reinsurance used in connection with certain insurance products and corporate insurance policies). The Company is also dependent on its dealings with banks and other financial institutions. If one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, or service that is significant to the Company\u2019s business, it could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which could in turn adversely affect its financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to its brand and reputation.\nPage 23 of 82\nThe property casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, and the Company may not be able to compete effectively against larger and/or better capitalized companies.\nThe Company faces intense competition in the property and casualty insurance industry. Competition in the property and casualty marketplace is based on many factors including premiums charged, services provided, financial strength ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payments, reputation, perceived financial strength, technology, and general experience. The Company competes with many regional and national property and casualty insurance companies. Many of these competitors are better capitalized than the Company, have greater financial, marketing and management resources than the Company, and have higher A.M. Best ratings. The superior capitalization, resources and ratings of the Company\u2019s competitors may enable them to offer lower rates, to withstand larger losses, and to more effectively take advantage of new marketing opportunities and attract new customers. Intense competitive pressure on prices can result from the actions of even a single large competitor. The Company\u2019s competition may also become increasingly better capitalized in the future as the traditional barriers between insurance companies and banks and other financial institutions erode and as the property and casualty industry continues to consolidate.\nThe Company may undertake strategic marketing and operating initiatives to improve its competitive position and drive growth. If the Company is unable to successfully implement new strategic initiatives or if the Company\u2019s marketing campaigns do not attract new customers, the Company\u2019s competitive position may be harmed, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nCrusader is a participant in various underwriting pools and programs which have legal power to levy assessments to Crusader.\nAs an admitted insurer in several states, Crusader is obligated to participate in various underwriting pools and programs run at federal and state levels. Examples include, but not limited to, a program established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 within the Department of the Treasury, California Assigned Risk Plan, California FAIR Plan, and California Insurance Guarantee Association. These underwriting pools and programs have legal powers to assess their participants for net losses sustained in these underwriting pools and programs operations. Such assessments could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK\nThe Company\u2019s goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise and thus does not focus on short-term earnings expectations.\nThe Company does not manage its business to maximize short-term stock performance. It also does not provide earnings estimates to the market and does not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. As a result, its reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors\u2019 expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of its common shares.\nIn addition, due to the Company\u2019s focus on the long-term value of an enterprise, it may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance its longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as its annual underwriting profit or earnings per share.\nThe Company is controlled by a small number of shareholders who will be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval.\nA small number of holders of the Company\u2019s stock own a majority of the voting power of the Company. Accordingly, those holders have the ability to exert significant influence on the outcome of corporate actions, involving the Company requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, change of control transactions or any other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other shareholders.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC require the Company to include in its Form 10-K a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting identified by management. Areas of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time. If management is unable to assert that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the Company\u2019s financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on its stock price.\nPage 24 of 82\nInsurance laws make it difficult to effect a change of control of the Company or the sale of any subsidiaries.\nTo acquire control of a U.S. insurance company or any holding company of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the Department of Insurance in the state where the insurer is domiciled. The Department of Insurance of the state will consider a number of factors relating to the acquirer and the transaction prior to granting approval of the application to acquire control of the insurer or the holding company. These laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company or the sale by the Company of any of its insurance subsidiaries, including transactions that some or all of the Company\u2019s shareholders might consider to be desirable.\nThe trading market for the Company\u2019s stock is relatively illiquid.\nThere has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for the Company\u2019s common stock, and a more active, liquid public trading market may not develop or may not be sustained. Limited liquidity in the trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock may adversely affect shareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of common stock at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they considers acceptable.", "PERMNO": 77973, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "UNAM"}
