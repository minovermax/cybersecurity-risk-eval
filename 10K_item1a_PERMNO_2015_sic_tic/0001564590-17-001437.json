Risk Factors.\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nWe Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas. Declines in Customers\u2019 Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America. When these expenditures decline, our business may suffer. Our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including current natural gas storage capacity and usage,\n\u2022\nthe prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas,\n\u2022\nthe supply of and demand for drilling and pressure pumping equipment,\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas,\n\u2022\nthe environmental, tax and other laws and governmental regulations regarding the exploration, development, production and delivery of oil and natural gas, and in particular, public pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state, foreign, regional and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate drilling and pressure pumping activities, including hydraulic fracturing, and\n\u2022\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.\nIn particular, our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices. For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile. Prices, and expectations about future prices, are affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nmarket supply and demand,\n\u2022\nthe desire and ability of OPEC to set and maintain production and price targets,\n\u2022\nthe level of production by OPEC and non-OPEC countries,\n\u2022\ndomestic and international military, political, economic and weather conditions,\n\u2022\nlegal and other limitations or restrictions on exportation and/or importation of oil and natural gas,\n\u2022\ntechnical advances affecting energy consumption and production, and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nAll of these factors are beyond our control. The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014. Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016. Oil prices averaged $49.15 during the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result of the lower level of oil prices, our industry has experienced a severe decline in both contract drilling and pressure pumping activity levels. Currently, our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and a significant portion of our fracturing horsepower is stacked.\nWe expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital. Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers\u2019 expectations of future oil and natural gas prices. A continued decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or expectations of further decreases in oil and natural gas prices, would likely result in further reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.\nGlobal Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nGlobal economic conditions and volatility in commodity prices may cause our customers to reduce or curtail their drilling and well completion programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our services. In addition, uncertainty in the capital markets, whether due to global economic conditions, low commodity prices or otherwise may result in reduced access to, or an inability to obtain, financing by us, our customers and our suppliers and result in reduced demand for our services. Furthermore, these factors may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability or unwillingness to pay suppliers, including us. The global economic environment in the past has experienced significant deterioration in a relatively short period, and there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors, including a decline in the price for oil or natural gas. A deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nExcess Equipment and a Highly Competitive Oil Service Industry May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins and the Carrying Value of our Assets.\nThe North American land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive, and at times available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment. A low commodity price environment can result in substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment being available than are needed to meet demand. In addition, in recent years there has been a substantial increase in the construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment. Low commodity prices and construction of new equipment can result in excess capacity and substantial competition for a declining number of drilling and pressure pumping contracts. Even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, reactivation and improvement of existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment, and movement of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment from region to region in response to market conditions or otherwise can lead to an excess supply of equipment. In addition, we may be unable to replace fixed-term contracts that were terminated early, extend expiring contracts or obtain new contracts in the spot market, and the rates and other material terms under any new or extended contracts may be on substantially less favorable rates and terms. Accordingly, high competition and excess equipment can cause drilling and pressure pumping contractors to have difficulty maintaining utilization and profit margins and, at times, result in operating losses. We cannot predict the future level of competition or excess equipment in the oil and natural gas contract drilling or pressure pumping businesses or the level of demand for our contract drilling or pressure pumping services.\nThe excess supply of operable land drilling rigs, increasing rig specialization and excess pressure pumping equipment, which has been exacerbated by the decline in oil and natural gas prices could affect the fair market value or our drilling and pressure pumping equipment, which in turn could result in additional impairments of our assets. A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets and goodwill.\nOur Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims. We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage. These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages. These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.\nWe have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance. In general, our customer contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage. Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers. In addition, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nOur customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons. Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and certain other assets, employer\u2019s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers\u2019 compensation and insurance for other specific risks. We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us. While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, a substantial portion of our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of such drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets. We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies. For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage, a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our general liability coverage, and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage. We also self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption and cyber risks, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.\nOur insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage. There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive, or that our coverage will cover a specific loss. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.\nFixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us. Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate or renegotiate or otherwise fail to honor their contractual obligations. In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above. As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog. In addition, the termination or renegotiation of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, our contract drilling backlog for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $417 million. Our contract drilling backlog may continue to decline as fixed-term drilling contract coverage over time may not be offset by new contracts, including as a result of the decline in the price of oil and natural gas, capital spending reductions by our customers or other factors.\nNew Technologies May Cause Our Operating Methods and Equipment to Become Less Competitive, and Higher Levels of Capital Expenditures May Be Necessary to Remain Competitive in Our Industry.\nThe market for our services is characterized by continual technological and process developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of drilling rigs and equipment. Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs. Accordingly, a higher level of capital expenditures may be required to maintain and improve existing rigs and equipment and purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers. In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could continue to result in oil and natural gas wells being drilled and completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days. Technological and process developments in the pressure pumping business could have similar effects.\nIn recent years, we have added drilling rigs to our fleet through new construction, and we have purchased new pressure pumping equipment. We have also improved existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment by adding equipment designed to enhance functionality and performance. Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced oil and natural gas drilling and pressure pumping technology, changes in technology, improvements in competitors\u2019 equipment and changes relating to the wells to be drilled and completed could make our equipment less competitive.\nIf we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances in a timely and cost-effective manner, demand for our services may decline. If any technology that we need to successfully compete is not available to us or that we implement in the future does not work as we expect, we may be adversely affected. Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or pressure pumping equipment obsolete, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation.\nShortages, Delays in Delivery, and Interruptions in Supply, of Equipment and Materials Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nDuring periods of increased demand for drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry has experienced shortages of equipment for upgrades, drill pipe, replacement parts and other equipment and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water. These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use. In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations. Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:\n\u2022\nweather issues, whether short-term such as a hurricane, or long-term such as a drought,\n\u2022\ntransportation and other logistical challenges, and\n\u2022\na shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties or bankruptcies or consolidation.\nThese price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs. Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to operate, maintain, upgrade and construct our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nLoss of Key Personnel and Competition for Experienced Personnel May Negatively Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe greatly depend on the efforts of our key employees to manage our operations. The loss of members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses. In times of increasing demand for our services, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly after a prolonged industry downturn. During periods of high demand for our services, wage rates for operations personnel are also likely to increase, resulting in higher operating costs. During periods of lower demand for our services, we may experience reductions in force and voluntary departures of key personnel, which could adversely affect our business and make it more it difficult to meet customer demands when demand for our services improves. In addition, even if it is generally a period of lower demand for our services, if there is a high demand for our services in certain areas, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel to perform services in such areas. The loss of key employees, the failure to attract and retain qualified personnel and the increase in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWith respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2016, we received approximately 51% from our ten largest customers, 33% from our five largest customers and 14% from our largest customer. The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nGrowth Through the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and Rig and Other Acquisitions Are Not Assured.\nWe have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping horsepower in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction. While we have entered into the merger agreement with SSE, there is no assurance that the SSE merger will be completed. The SSE merger is subject to a number of conditions, certain of which are beyond our control and may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect completion of the SSE merger. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future or that we will be able to execute timely or efficiently any plans for building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment. We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities. In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, improved commodity prices may cause contract drillers to continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services to continue to build new, high horsepower equipment.\nThere can be no assurance that we will:\n\u2022\nhave sufficient capital resources to complete additional acquisitions or build new rigs or pressure pumping equipment,\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate additional drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets or businesses,\n\u2022\neffectively manage the growth and increased size of our organization, drilling fleet and pressure pumping equipment,\n\u2022\nsuccessfully deploy idle, stacked or additional rigs and pressure pumping equipment,\n\u2022\nmaintain the crews necessary to operate additional drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, or\n\u2022\nsuccessfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources. See \u201c-Risk Factors Relating to the Pending SSE Merger.\u201d\nEnvironmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial. A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to:\n\u2022\nsubstantial civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties,\n\u2022\nmodification, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations,\n\u2022\nimposition of limitations on our operations, and\n\u2022\nperformance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nIn addition, environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate impose a variety of requirements on \u201cresponsible parties\u201d related to the prevention of spills and liability for damages from such spills. As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and a manufacturer and servicer of oilfield service equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position. For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (\u201cNESHAPS\u201d) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates and expands the New Source Performance Standards by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. In addition, the EPA has announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities. The EPA also published a final rule in June 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry. In November 2016, the Department of the Interior issued final rules relating to the venting, flaring and leaking of natural gas by oil and natural gas producers who operate on federal and Indian lands. The rules limit routine flaring of natural gas, require the payment of royalties on avoidable gas losses and require plans or programs relating to gas capture and leak detection and repair. These or other initiatives could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nPotential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.\nMembers of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing proposals for more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. For example, the EPA conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. As part of this study, the EPA sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on hydraulic fracturing practices. We responded to the inquiry. The EPA released its final report in December 2016. It concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells. Further, we conduct drilling and pressure pumping activities in numerous states. Some parties believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such seismic activity is called induced seismicity. The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity. These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) and other aspects of the oil and gas industry.\nIn addition, legislation has been proposed, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress to amend the SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage. These bills, if enacted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could limit or delay operational activities or increase operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform or limit hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nRegulatory efforts at the federal level and in many states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using fluids that contain \u201cdiesel fuel\u201d under the SDWA Underground Injection Control Program and has released a revised guidance regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel. In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Further, in March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on Indian land. The rule requires companies to publicly disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the BLM. However, in June 2016, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming struck down the rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule. That decision is currently being appealed by the federal government. In June 2016, the EPA published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works. These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. Certain states where we operate have adopted or are considering disclosure legislation and/or regulations. For example, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure. Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.\nIn addition, in light of concerns about induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (\u201cOCC\u201d) has implemented volume reduction plans, and at times required shut-ins, for oil and natural gas disposal wells injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation. The OCC also recently released well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the SCOOP and STACK plays that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity.\nFinally, some jurisdictions have taken steps to enact hydraulic fracturing bans or moratoria. In June 2015, New York banned high volume fracturing activities combined with horizontal drilling. Certain communities in Colorado have also enacted bans on hydraulic fracturing. Voters in the city of Denton, Texas approved a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in November 2014, though it was later lifted in 2015. These actions have been the subject of legal challenges.\nThe adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and reduce demand for our services. Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Design, Manufacture, Sale and Servicing of Products, including Rig Components, May Subject Us to Liability for Personal Injury, Property Damage and Environmental Contamination Should Such Equipment Fail to Perform to Specifications.\nWe provide products, including rig components such as top drives, to customers involved in oil and gas exploration, development and production. Because of applications which use our products and services, a failure of such equipment, or a failure of our customer to maintain or operate the equipment properly, could cause damage to the equipment, damage to the property of customers and others, personal injury and environmental contamination, leading to claims against us.\nLegislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nWe are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement. The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources on an annual basis. Further, following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA finalized a rule to address permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act\u2019s New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V programs. This final rule \u201ctailors\u201d the PSD and Title V programs to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting. However, in June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court in UARG v. EPA limited application of this rule to sources that would otherwise need permits based on emission of conventional pollutants. In April 2015, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed the rule in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. In October 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting requirements. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. Also, in November 2016, the EPA published a final rule adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report GHG emissions resulting from equipment leaks. In addition, the United States was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. Several states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs. Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations. The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program. We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nLegal Proceedings Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business.\nThe nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time. In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions, such as the one we are currently experiencing, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, vendors, current and former employees and others initiating legal proceedings against us. Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nPolitical, Economic and Social Instability Risk and Laws Associated with Conducting International Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Opportunities and Future Business.\nWe currently conduct operations in Canada, and we have incurred selling, general and administrative expenses related to the evaluation of and preparation for other international opportunities. Also, through our recent Warrior acquisition, we sell products, including rig components, for use in numerous oil and gas producing regions outside of North America. International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties generally not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social and political unrest, strikes, terrorism, war, kidnapping of employees, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, difficulty resolving disputes and enforcing contractual rights, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of oil and gas exploration and drilling rights, changes in taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital, currency rate fluctuations, increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and industry in the\nmarkets in which we may operate, economic and financial instability of national oil companies, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.\nThere can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements, or the interpretation thereof, which could have a material adverse effect on the cost of entry into international markets, the profitability of international operations or the ability to continue those operations in certain areas. Because of the impact of local laws, any future international operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.\nThere can be no assurance that we will:\n\u2022\nidentify attractive opportunities in international markets,\n\u2022\nhave sufficient capital resources to pursue and consummate international opportunities,\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate international drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets or businesses,\n\u2022\neffectively manage the start-up, development and growth of an international organization and assets,\n\u2022\nhire, attract and retain the personnel necessary to successfully conduct international operations, or\n\u2022\nreceive awards for work and successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of the entry into one or more international markets.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some parts of the world where contract drilling and pressure pumping activities are conducted or where our consumers for the Warrior products are located have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practice and could impact business. Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject to us to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness to finance an international transaction or operations, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such transactions or operations. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, international expansion could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.\nThe occurrence of one or more events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Business Is Subject to Cybersecurity Risks and Threats.\nThreats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our and customers\u2019 business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems, unauthorized disclosure of personal information, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nWe Are Dependent Upon Our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under our Long-Term Debt\nWe have borrowings outstanding under our senior notes and, from time to time, our revolving credit facility. These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing U.S. subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.\nVariable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.\nWe have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility. Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate. Until September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 2.75% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 1.75% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio. Beginning September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 3.25% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 2.25% to 2.75%, in each case determined based on our excess availability under the credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.75%. Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at September 30, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans was 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.75% as of January 1, 2017. Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nWe have in place a reimbursement agreement pursuant to which we are required to reimburse the issuing bank on demand for any amounts that it has disbursed under any of our letters of credit issued thereunder. We are obligated to pay the issuing bank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum. As of December 31, 2016, no amounts had been disbursed under any letters of credit.\nInterest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed.\nAnti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.\nWe are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law. Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock. It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting. In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder. As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us. This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.\nRisk Factors Related to the Pending SSE Merger\nOur expectations regarding our business may be impacted by the following risk factors related to the pending SSE merger:\nThe SSE Merger is Subject to Conditions, Including Certain Conditions That May Not Be Satisfied, or Completed on a Timely Basis, If At All.\nThe SSE merger is subject to a number of conditions, certain of which are beyond our control and may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect completion of the SSE merger. Notably, the completion of the SSE merger is conditioned on receiving the approval of both our and SSE\u2019s respective stockholders. At any time prior to the receipt of such approvals, each of our board of directors and the board of directors of SSE may change its recommendation with respect to the SSE merger, in each case in response to a superior proposal or an intervening event if the applicable board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, among other things, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and complies with certain other specified conditions. Consequently, we cannot predict whether and when these conditions will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the SSE merger could cause the combined company not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the SSE merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.\nCurrent Patterson-UTI Stockholders Will Have a Reduced Ownership and Voting Interest in the Combined Company After the SSE Merger.\nWe will issue up to 49,559,000 shares of common stock to SSE stockholders in the SSE merger. As a result of these issuances, SSE stockholders are expected to hold up to approximately 23% of the combined company\u2019s outstanding common stock immediately following completion of the SSE merger.\nOur stockholders currently have the right to vote for our directors and on other matters affecting our company. Each of our stockholders will remain a stockholder of our company with a percentage ownership of the combined company that will be smaller than the stockholder\u2019s percentage of our company prior to the SSE merger. As a result of these reduced ownership percentages, our stockholders will have less voting power in the combined company than they now have with respect to our company.\nUncertainties Associated With the SSE Merger May Cause a Loss of Key Employees, Which Could Adversely Affect the Future Business and Operations of the Combined Company.\nWe are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plan. Our success until the SSE merger and the combined company\u2019s success after the SSE merger will depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees. Current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the SSE merger, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract or retain key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent that we have previously been able to attract or retain our own employees.\nFailure to Complete the SSE Merger Could Negatively Impact Our Future Business and Financial Results.\nWe cannot make any assurances that we will be able to satisfy all of the conditions to the SSE merger or succeed in any litigation brought in connection with the SSE merger. If the SSE merger is not completed, our financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nbeing required to pay SSE a termination fee of either $40,000,000 or $100,000,000, in each case under certain circumstances provided in the merger agreement;\n\u2022\npayment of costs relating to the SSE merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees, regardless of whether the SSE merger is completed;\n\u2022\nthe focus of our management team on the SSE merger instead of the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and\n\u2022\nthe potential occurrence of litigation related to any failure to complete the SSE merger.\nIn addition, if the SSE merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. If the SSE merger is not completed, we cannot assure our stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nThe Merger Agreement Contains Provisions That Limit Our Ability to Pursue Alternatives to the SSE Merger, Could Discourage a Potential Competing Acquirer of Us From Making a Favorable Alternative Transaction Proposal and, in Specified Circumstances, Could Require Us to Pay a Termination Fee to SSE.\nThe merger agreement contains \u201cnon-solicitation\u201d provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, facilitate, knowingly encourage or induce or take any action that could be reasonably expected to lead to the making, submission or announcement of a proposal competing with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, while our board of directors has the ability, in certain circumstances, to change its recommendation of the transaction to our stockholders, we cannot terminate the merger agreement to accept an alternative proposal, and SSE generally has an opportunity to modify the terms of the SSE merger and the merger agreement in response to any alternative proposals that may be made before our board of directors may withdraw or modify its recommendation. Moreover, in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay up to $7,500,000 of SSE\u2019s expenses or we may be required to pay SSE a termination fee of either $40,000,000 or $100,000,000.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the SSE merger. In addition, these provisions might result in a potential third party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to our stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the SSE merger.\nCompletion of the SSE Merger May Trigger Change in Control or Other Provisions in Certain Agreements to Which SSE is a Party.\nThe completion of the SSE merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which SSE is a party. If we and SSE are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if we and SSE are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to SSE or the combined company.\nWe and SSE May be Unable to Obtain the Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required to Complete the SSE Merger or, in Order to Do So, We May be Required to Comply With Material Restrictions or Conditions.\nUnder the HSR Act, neither we nor SSE may complete the SSE merger until required information and materials are furnished to the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act terminates or expires. On January 3, 2017, we and SSE filed the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC. On January 13, 2017, we and SSE were notified by the FTC that the early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act had been granted.\nThe SSE merger may also be subject to the regulatory requirements of other municipal, state, federal, or foreign governmental agencies and authorities. Regulatory entities may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their approval or in connection with their review.\nThe merger agreement may require us to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely impact the combined company without us having the right to refuse to close the SSE merger on the basis of those regulatory conditions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will obtain the necessary clearances or approvals, or that any required conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the combined company following the SSE merger or result in the abandonment of the SSE merger.\nAdditionally, even after the above-described statutory waiting periods have expired, and even after completion of the SSE merger, governmental authorities could seek to challenge the SSE merger. We may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws.\nThe Pendency of the SSE Merger Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Operations.\nIn connection with the pending SSE merger, some of our customers or vendors may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses, regardless of whether the SSE merger is completed. Similarly, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the SSE merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the SSE merger and which may materially adversely divert attention from the daily activities of our existing employees.\nIn addition, due to operating covenants in the merger agreement, we may be unable, during the pendency of the SSE merger, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions that are not in the ordinary course of business, even if such actions would prove beneficial to us. Further, the process of seeking to accomplish the SSE merger could also divert the focus of management from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to us, without realizing any of the benefits which might have resulted had the SSE merger been completed.", "PERMNO": 79857, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "PTEN"}
