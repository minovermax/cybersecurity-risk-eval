{"cik": "1604191", "company": "First Wave BioPharma, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. These risks could cause actual operating results to differ from those expressed in certain \u201cforward looking statements\u201d contained in this Annual Report as well as in other communications.\nSummary of Risk Factors\n\u25cf\nWe have never generated any product revenues.\n\u25cf\nWe expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u25cf\nWe will need substantial additional funding, and certain terms included in our financing transactions may restrict our ability to raise such capital at the times and in the manner we may require.\n\u25cf\nTo date, most of our development activities have been focused on our niclosamide and adrulipase product candidates, which are still under clinical development, and if niclosamide and adrulipase do not receive regulatory approval or is not successfully commercialized, our business will be harmed.\n\u25cf\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and other geopolitical events, including the war in Ukraine could adversely impact our business, including our clinical trials.\n\u25cf\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u25cf\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement and involve an uncertain outcome.\n\u25cf\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\n\u25cf\nWe do not have our own manufacturing capabilities and will rely on third parties to produce clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates.\n\u25cf\nWe intend to rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\n\u25cf\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\n\u25cf\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future, and consequently, any gains from an investment in our Common Stock will likely depend on appreciation in the price of our Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company and have a limited operating history upon which to base an investment decision.\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. Since inception, we have engaged primarily in research and development activities of niclosamide and adrulipase. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant net losses. We have not demonstrated our ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates. The successful commercialization of any of our products will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u25cf\ncontinuing to undertake pre-clinical development and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nparticipating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u25cf\nformulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u25cf\nconducting sales and marketing activities.\nOur operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing, acquiring, developing and securing the proprietary rights for, and undertaking pre-clinical development, manufacturing and clinical trials of adrulipase, and the acquisition of rights to and clinical trials for niclosamide. These operations provide a limited basis for our stockholders and prospective investors to assess our ability to complete development of or commercialize niclosamide and adrulipase or any other product candidates and the advisability of investing in our securities.\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from our operations since inception. As of December 31, 2021, we had accumulated deficit of approximately $153.9 million and negative working capital of approximately $2.9 million. Based on our historical and anticipated rate of cash expenditures, we do not anticipate our existing working capital will be sufficient to sustain our business through the commercialization of our product candidates. Therefore, we are dependent on obtaining, and are continuing to pursue, the necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of securities in order to continue our operations. We are actively working to obtain additional funding. We cannot make any assurances that additional financings will be available to us and, if available, completed on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to complete an equity and/or debt offering, or otherwise obtain sufficient financing when and if needed, it would negatively impact our business and operations, which would likely cause the price of our Common Stock to decline or ultimately force us to cease our operations.\nA pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, or coronavirus, may materially and adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has affected segments of the global economy and may affect our operations, including the potential interruption of our clinical trial activities and our supply chain. Beginning in March 2020, the majority of our workforce began working from home. Disruptions caused by the continued spread of COVID-19, including the effects of stay-at-home orders and work-from-home policies, have impacted productivity and may result in further periods of business disruption, including delays in our clinical trials or delays or disruptions in our supply chain. In addition, there could be a potential effect of COVID-19 to the business at FDA or other health authorities, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals, including with respect to our product candidates.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 globally could adversely affect our clinical trial operations in the United States and Europe and other jurisdictions where we may decide to conduct clinical trials, including our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 if an outbreak occurs in their geography. We have already experienced certain delays of our clinical trials and may experience further delays as the pandemic continues. Disruptions in national or international shipments and deliveries could impede our ability to distribute product to trial sites in a timely manner. Any of the foregoing factors could delay our ability to conduct clinical trials or release clinical trial results. COVID-19 may also affect employees of third-party CROs located in affected geographies that we rely upon to carry out our clinical trials, which could result in inefficiencies due to reductions in staff and disruptions to work environments.\nThe spread of COVID-19, or another infectious disease, could also negatively affect the operations at our third-party manufacturers, which could result in delays or disruptions in the supply of our product candidates. In addition, we have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring all employees to work remotely, suspending all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees, and discouraging employee attendance at industry events and in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe have implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business. We continue to operate normally with the exception of enabling all of our employees to work productively at home and abiding by travel restrictions issued by federal, state and local governments. Our current plans to return to the office remain fluid as federal, state and local guidelines, rules and regulations continue to evolve.\nWe cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, however, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn addition, the global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets and may materially affect us economically and such conditions continue to persist. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our Common Stock.\nGeopolitical risks associated with Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine could result in increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe uncertain nature, scope, magnitude, and duration of hostilities stemming from Russia\u2019s recent military invasion of Ukraine, including the potential effects of such hostilities as well as sanctions, embargoes, asset freezes, cyber-attacks and other actions taken in response to such hostilities on the world economy and markets, have disrupted global markets and contributed to increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could have an adverse impact on macroeconomic and other factors that affect our business and supply chain. There can be no certainty regarding the impacts stemming from the invasion, including the imposition of additional sanctions, embargoes, asset freezes or other economic or military measures resulting from the invasion. The impact of these developments, and additional events that may occur as a result, is currently unknown and could adversely affect our business, supply chain, suppliers and customers and potential customers. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, the availability and cost of materials, supplies, labor, currency exchange rates and financial markets, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will face intense competition and may not be able to compete successfully.\nWe operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Niclosamide and adrulipase, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies, as well as new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. New developments, including the development of other biological and pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates. In the case of niclosamide, we may also face competition from other companies developing different formulation of niclosamide for the same indications for which we intend to develop niclosamide, or from off-label uses of niclosamide approved for other indications.\nWe may incur substantial product liability or indemnification claims relating to the use of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure based on the use of niclosamide and adrulipase in human clinical trials, or, if obtained, following marketing approval and commercialization. Claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. Although we have and intend to maintain product liability insurance relating to our clinical trials, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us and we may be unable to maintain such insurance. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim. We are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing. Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to the testing and use of our product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications.\nWe cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result from the use of our products and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we currently hold, or that we or our collaborators may obtain, may not be adequate to protect us from any claims arising from the use of our products that are beyond the limit of our insurance coverage. If we cannot protect against potential liability claims, we or our collaborators may find it difficult or impossible to commercialize our products, and we may not be able to renew or increase our insurance coverage on reasonable terms, if at all. The marketing, sale and use of our products and our planned future products could lead to the filing of product liability claims against us if someone alleges that our products failed to perform as designed. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.\nAny product liability or professional liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could damage our reputation, result in the recall of products, or cause current partners to terminate existing agreements and potential partners to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.\nWe use biological materials and may use hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming or costly.\nWe may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds, that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property and casualty, and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 17 employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, research and development, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u25cf\nidentifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees;\n\u25cf\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical, FDA and international regulatory review process for our product candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and\n\u25cf\nimproving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services, including certain aspects of regulatory approval, clinical management and manufacturing. There can be no assurance that the services of independent organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates or otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants and contractors or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe collect and maintain information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have established physical, electronic and organizational measures to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data compromise, and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our information technology systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current and any future collaborators, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.\nThe risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged.\nIn addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if applicable, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing rules and regulations, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws.\nUnder the EU regulation and notably the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, No. 2016/679, which entered into force on May 25, 2018 and is applicable personal data that we process in relation to our presence in the EU, the offering of products or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of the behavior of individuals in the EU, we have also a legal responsibility to report personal data breaches to the competent supervisory authority. The EU data protection regulation includes a broad definition and a short deadline for the notification of personal data breaches, which may be difficult to implement in practice and requires that we implement robust internal processes. Under this regulation, we have to report personal data breaches to the competent supervisory authority within 72 hours of the time we become aware of a breach \u201cunless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the right and freedoms of natural persons\u201d (Article 33 of the GDPR). In addition, the GDPR requires that we communicate the breach to the Data Subject if the breach is \u201clikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons\u201d (Article 34 of the GDPR). In order to fulfil these requirements, we have to implement specific internal processes to be followed in case of a personal data breach, which will allow us to (a) contain and recover the breach, (b) assess the risk to the data subjects, (c) notify, and possibly communicate the breach to the data subjects, (d) investigate and respond to the breach. The performance of these processes implies substantial costs in resources and time.\nMoreover, as we may rely on third parties that will also process as processor the data for which we are a data controller-for example, in the context of the manufacturing of our product candidates or for the conduct of clinical trials, we must contractually ensure that strict security measures, as well as appropriate obligations including an obligation to report in due delay any security incident are implemented, in order to allow us fulfilling our own regulatory requirements.\nWe would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability for any security breach on personal data for which we are data controller. The costs of above-mentioned processes together with legal penalties, possible compensation for damages and any resulting lawsuits arising from a breach may be extensive and may have a negative impact on reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn August 2019, management was advised that it was a victim of a cyber-related fraud whereby a hacker impersonated one of our key vendors to redirect payments, totaling approximately $420,000. Management and our Audit Committee completed our investigation and is reviewing all available avenues of recovery, including from our financial institution to recover the payments. As of December 31, 2021, we have recovered approximately $50,000 from our financial institution but we are unable to determine the probability of recovering anything further from the cyber-related fraud. As a result of the cyber-related fraud, we have instituted additional controls and procedures and all employees now undergone cybersecurity training.\nRequirements associated with being a public company will increase our costs significantly and will divert significant company resources and management attention.\nSince we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, we are no longer able to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that were previously available to us, but which were not available to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Accordingly, we will be required to comply with increased disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, we will incur greater expenses associated with such reporting requirements. These expenses would further increase if we ceased to be a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d In addition, if we are deemed an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer in the future, we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements applicable to companies that are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have not yet completed the process of compiling the system and processing documentation needed to comply with such requirements. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion when required to do so. In that regard, we currently do not have an internal audit function, and we will need to hire or contract for additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge.\nOur management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of this.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nOur product candidates are at an early stage of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized.\nWe have no products approved for sale. Niclosamide, which we acquired in 2021, and adrulipase are in the early stages of clinical development. Our product candidates will require substantial capital expenditures, development, testing, and regulatory clearances prior to commercialization. The development and regulatory approval process take several years, and it is not likely that any such products, even if successfully developed and approved by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority, would be commercially available for a significant period of time. Many promising drug candidates fail at some stage of their clinical development. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to fund our development programs, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will be successfully developed, receive required regulatory approvals and successfully commercialized. Our failure to develop, manufacture or receive regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, could result in the failure of our business and a loss of all of your investment in our company.\nAny product candidates we advance into and through clinical development are subject to extensive regulation, which can be costly and time consuming, cause unanticipated delays or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets, including Health Canada\u2019s Therapeutic Products Directorate, or the TPD, and the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive approval of an NDA (New Drug Application) or BLA (Biologic License Application) from the FDA. The process of obtaining such approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition to the significant clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for these product candidates depends on obtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our product manufacturing processes, testing procedures or facilities are insufficient to justify approval. Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.\nThe FDA, the TPD and/or the EMA can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndisagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nfailure to demonstrate to their satisfaction that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u25cf\nfailure to accept clinical data from trials which are conducted outside their jurisdiction;\n\u25cf\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf\nsuch agencies may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nfailure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u25cf\nchanges in the approval policies or regulations of such agencies may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nAny delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u25cf\nthe size of the patient population;\n\u25cf\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u25cf\nthe design of the trial;\n\u25cf\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u25cf\nThe availability of other clinical trials and competition for eligible patients;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u25cf\nthe risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion.\nOur clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates. This competition will reduce the number and types of patients and qualified clinical investigators available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors or clinical trial sites may not allow us to conduct our clinical trial at such site if competing trials are already being conducted there. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. We may also encounter difficulties finding a clinical trial site at which to conduct our trials.\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these clinical trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates.\nBecause the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risk. We will be required to demonstrate through well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Adrulipase, has only completed three Phase 2 clinical trials in two separate indications (two Phase 2 in CF patients and one Phase 2 in CP patients). Niclosamide has completed a Phase 1b/2a study, conducted by First Wave, in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Success in pre-clinical studies or early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful, as product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. We also may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently anticipated. Drug developers frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results.\nAny product candidate we advance into and through clinical trials may cause unacceptable adverse events or have other properties that may delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization or limit their commercial potential.\nUnacceptable adverse events caused by niclosamide and adrulipase in clinical trials could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This, in turn, could prevent us from commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenues from its sale. We have not yet completed testing of any of our product candidates for the treatment of the indications for which we intend to seek product approval in humans, and we currently do not know the extent of adverse events, if any, that will be observed in patients who receive any of our product candidates. If any of our product candidates cause unacceptable adverse events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product or, if such product candidate is approved for marketing, future adverse events could cause us to withdraw such product from the market.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials could result in increased costs and delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nAlthough we commenced the ongoing FW-COV RESEVOIR and the FW-UP clinical trials in 2021, the commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u25cf\nobtaining regulatory clearance to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nidentifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u25cf\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject to modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf\nobtaining sufficient quantities of investigational product (\u201cIP\u201d) for our product candidates for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nobtaining Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u25cf\nidentifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial, including delays and/or interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, such as the war in Ukraine, disease or public health epidemics, such as the coronavirus, or natural disasters;\n\u25cf\nretaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, changing clinical protocols, fatigue with the clinical trial process, or personal issues;\n\u25cf\nretaining patients who may not follow the clinical trial protocols due to factors including the coronavirus epidemic; and\n\u25cf\navailability of funds.\nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials will delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval for our product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nThe timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including the size and nature of the patient population and the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol, competition from competing companies, natural disasters, geo-political events, such as the war in Ukraine or public health epidemics, such as the coronavirus impacting the U.S., Europe and elsewhere.\nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive or the trials are not well designed.\nRegulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time recommend the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with current cGCPs or other applicable foreign government guidelines governing the design, safety monitoring, quality assurance and ethical considerations associated with clinical studies. Clinical trials are subject to oversight by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies and IRBs at the study sites where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced in accordance with applicable cGMPs, which are the FDA\u2019s regulations governing the design, monitoring and control of manufacturing processes and facilities. Clinical trials may be suspended by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies, or us for various reasons, including:\n\u25cf\ndeficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols;\n\u25cf\ndeficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u25cf\nthe product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\ndeficiencies in the trial design necessary to demonstrate efficacy;\n\u25cf\nfatalities or other adverse events arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe product candidate may not appear to be more effective than current therapies; or\n\u25cf\nthe quality or stability of the product candidate may fall below acceptable standards.\nIf we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial for niclosamide and adrulipase the commercial prospects for that product candidate will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product candidate may be delayed or eliminated. Furthermore, any of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these product candidates either by us or by our collaboration partners.\nThe approval processes of regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming, expensive and inherently unpredictable. If we are unable to obtain approval for our product candidates from applicable regulatory authorities, we will not be able to market and sell those product candidates in those countries or regions and our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. We have not submitted an NDA or similar filing or obtained regulatory approval for any drug candidate in any jurisdiction and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nNiclosamide and adrulipase could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including any one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u25cf\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to hold to previous agreements or commitments;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve our product candidates;\n\u25cf\ninvest significant additional cash in each of the above activities; and\n\u25cf\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe time and expense of the approval process, as well as the unpredictability of clinical trial results and other contributing factors, may result in our failure to obtain regulatory approval to market, in one or more jurisdictions niclosamide, adrulipase or future product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, even if we were to obtain regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions, regulatory authorities may approve niclosamide and adrulipase for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the prices we may propose to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with labeling that does not include the claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing circumstances could materially harm the commercial prospects for niclosamide and adrulipase.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of the approved labeling, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nResults of current and future clinical trials of niclosamide and adrulipase could reveal a high and/or unacceptable severity and frequency of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Further, any observed drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nAdditionally, if niclosamide and adrulipase receive marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by our products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings in the product\u2019s labeling;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to create a medication guide for distribution to patients that outlines the risks of such side effects;\n\u25cf\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u25cf\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects\nIf we are unable to execute our sales and marketing strategy for our products and are unable to gain market acceptance, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our business.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and have yet to begin to generate revenue from niclosamide and adrulipase. Our product candidates are in an early stage of clinical development, and, if we obtain marketing approval for any of products in the future, which we anticipate would not occur for several years, if at all.\nWe may never gain significant market acceptance for our product candidates and therefore may never generate substantial revenue or profits for us. We will need to establish a market for any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval through physician education, sales and marketing efforts, awareness programs and the publication of clinical data. Gaining acceptance in medical communities requires, among other things, publication in leading peer-reviewed journals of results from our studies. The process of publication in leading medical journals is subject to a peer review process and peer reviewers may not consider the results of our studies sufficiently novel or worthy of publication. Failure to have our studies published in peer-reviewed journals could limit the adoption of niclosamide and adrulipase. Our ability to successfully market our product candidates that we may develop will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to demonstrate effectively that the clinical and other benefits of a product candidate outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to demonstrate effectively that the efficacy of a product candidate is superior to a competing treatment;\n\u25cf\nconducting clinical utility studies of our product candidates to demonstrate economic usefulness to providers and payers;\n\u25cf\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf\nwhether our current or future partners, support our offerings;\n\u25cf\nthe success of the sales force and marketing effort;\n\u25cf\nunfavorable publicity relating to the product;\n\u25cf\nwhether healthcare providers believe our product candidates provide clinical utility relative to their cost; and\n\u25cf\nwhether private health insurers, government health programs and other third-party payers will cover our product candidates.\nWe currently have no commercial organization. If we are unable to establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities or secure a sales and marketing partner, we may not successfully commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe have no commercial infrastructure. In order to commercialize products that are approved for marketing, we must either establish our own sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have such commercial infrastructure.\nWe may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. If we elect to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we will have to compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u25cf\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our future products;\n\u25cf\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, or if we do not successfully enter into appropriate collaboration arrangements, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our product candidates and any we may develop or acquire, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Outside the United States, we may commercialize our product candidates by entering into collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical partners. We may not be able to enter into such agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nFrom time to time, we may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to niclosamide and adrulipase and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. These relationships also may result in a delay in the development of niclosamide and adrulipase if we become dependent upon the other party and such other party does not prioritize the development of our product candidates relative to its other development activities. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If we license products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. We rely completely on third parties to manufacture our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies and expect to continue to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of our product candidates, and our dependence on third party suppliers could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely completely on third parties to manufacture our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies and expect to continue to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidate, and our dependence on third party suppliers could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, including niclosamide and adrulipase. The proprietary yeast cell line from which the adrulipase API is derived is kept at a storage facility maintained by Charles River Laboratories Inc. Adrulipase drug substance and drug product are currently manufactured at a contract facility located in Tianjin, China owned by Asymchem Life Science Co., Ltd. We believe there are multiple alternative contract manufacturers capable of producing the adrulipase product we need for clinical trials. There is no guarantee that the processes are easily reproducible and transferrable.\nNiclosamide API is obtained by chemical synthesis and is currently manufactured by Olon SpA at a facility in Murcia, Spain. The drug product manufacturing for niclosamide is currently conducted at a contract facility located in Milan, Italy and Tianjin, China owned by Monteresearch s.r.l. and Asymchem Life Science Co., Ltd, respectively.\nWe are completely dependent on these third parties for product supply and our niclosamide and adrulipase development programs would be adversely affected by a significant interruption in our ability to receive such materials. We have not yet entered into long-term manufacturing or supply agreements with any third parties. Furthermore, our third-party suppliers will be required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. In the event that the FDA or such other authorities determine that our third-party suppliers have not complied with cGMP, our clinical trials could be terminated or subjected to a clinical hold until such time as we are able to obtain appropriate replacement material. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to commercially manufacture any of our proposed products, if approved, and will likely continue to be dependent upon third party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply us with clinical trial materials and any approved products may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products on a timely basis or at all.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet our deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. We use contract research organizations (CROs) to conduct our clinical trials and will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols. Our CROs, investigators and other third parties will play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators and other third parties upon which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fail to meet expected deadlines, fail to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. If any of our clinical trial sites terminate for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer the care of those patients to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be jeopardized.\nWe intend to rely on market exclusivity periods that may not be or remain available to us.\nWe intend to rely on our ability to obtain and maintain a regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our product candidates, including niclosamide and adrulipase that are successfully developed and approved for commercialization. Although this period in the United States is currently 12 years from the date of marketing approval, reductions to this period have been proposed. This exclusivity period in Europe is currently 10 years from the date of marketing approval by the EMA. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our products, which would materially adversely affect us.\nBecause niclosamide is a small molecule it would be subject either to three or five year exclusivity, depending on the regulatory pathway of any clinical trials. Niclosamide is not entitled to the same 12-year exclusivity as our biologic product candidates.\nDue to the significant resources required for the development of our product candidates, we must prioritize development of certain product candidates and/or certain disease indications. We may expend our limited resources on candidates or indications that do not yield a successful product and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe intend to develop a pipeline of product candidates to treat GI and other diseases. Due to the significant resources required for the development of product candidates, we must focus our attention and resources on specific diseases and/or indications and decide which product candidates to pursue and the amount of resources to allocate to each. We are currently focusing our resources on the development of our product candidates, niclosamide and adrulipase.\nOur decisions concerning the allocation of research, development, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of any viable commercial product and may divert resources away from better opportunities. Similarly, any decision to delay, terminate or collaborate with third parties in respect of certain programs or product candidates may subsequently prove to be suboptimal and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities. If we make incorrect determinations regarding the viability or market potential of any of our programs or product candidates or misread trends in the GI, CF, CP, COVID-19, ICI-AC or biotechnology industry, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As a result, we may fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities, be required to forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other diseases and indications that may later prove to have greater commercial potential than those we choose to pursue, or relinquish valuable rights to such product candidates through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to invest additional resources to retain development and commercialization rights.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and clinical development personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are dependent on our management team and clinical development personnel and our success will depend on their continued service, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In particular, the continued development of our senior management team which now includes James Sapirstein, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Sarah Romano, our Chief Financial Officer, and James Pennington, our Chief Medical Officer, is critical to our success. The market for the services of qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. The loss of service of any member of our senior management team or key personnel could prevent, impair or delay the implementation of our business plan, the successful conduct and completion of our planned clinical trials and the commercialization of any product candidates that we may successfully develop. We do not carry key man insurance for any member of our senior management team.\nHealthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our financial returns.\nOur ability or the ability of our collaborators to commercialize any of our product candidates that we successfully develop may depend, in part, on the extent to which government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse consumers for the cost of these products. These third parties are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new drug products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates to enable us or our collaborators to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on their and our investments in research and product development.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues.\nThe potential pricing and reimbursement environment for niclosamide, adrulipase and any future drug products may change in the future and become more challenging due to, among other reasons, policies advanced by the current or any new presidential administration, federal agencies, healthcare legislation passed by Congress, or fiscal challenges faced by all levels of government health administration authorities.\nIf we or any of our independent contractors, consultants, collaborators, manufacturers, vendors or service providers fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions, which could result in penalties and affect our ability to develop, market and sell our product candidates and may harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights. These laws and regulations include:\n\u25cf\nthe U.S. federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for a healthcare item or service, or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u25cf\nthe U.S. federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, claims for payment by government funded programs such as Medicare or Medicaid that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to us by virtue of statements and representations made to customers or third parties;\n\u25cf\nthe U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud healthcare programs;\n\u25cf\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members, which is published in a searchable form on an annual basis; and\n\u25cf\nstate laws comparable to each of the above federal laws, such as, for example, anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and also apply to commercial insurers and other non-federal payors, requirements for mandatory corporate regulatory compliance programs, and laws relating to patient data privacy and security.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any such health care laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nOur employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, any future commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA, EMA and other similar regulatory bodies, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; manufacturing standards; healthcare fraud and abuse, data privacy laws and other similar laws; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, the creation of fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, possible exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur success will depend upon intellectual property, proprietary technologies and regulatory market exclusivity periods, and we may be unable to protect our intellectual property.\nOur success will depend, in large part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for niclosamide and adrulipase and their formulations and uses, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. If we or our licensors fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize these product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. This failure to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to these product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or our partners will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u25cf\npatent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n\u25cf\npatents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u25cf\nour competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we or our partners and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products;\n\u25cf\nthere may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns;\n\u25cf\ncountries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop, and market competing products; and\n\u25cf\nwe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nIn addition to patents, we and our partners also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors, third parties may still obtain this information or come upon this same or similar information independently. We may become subject to claims that we or consultants, advisors or independent contractors that we may engage to assist us in developing niclosamide and adrulipase have wrongfully or inadvertently disclosed to us or used trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their other clients.\nIf we or our partners are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends upon our ability and the ability of any of our future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may be directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter of our intellectual property. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our product candidates of which we are not aware.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third-party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may have to:\n\u25cf\nobtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf\nabandon an infringing product candidate or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u25cf\npay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party\u2019s rights;\n\u25cf\npay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross licenses to our technology; and/or\n\u25cf\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nOur ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights.\nOur success depends on obtaining and maintaining proprietary rights to our product candidates for the treatment of age-related diseases, as well as successfully defending these rights against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our product candidates, and their uses from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents, or effectively protected trade secrets, cover them. Our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates is uncertain due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nwe may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patent\n\u25cf\nwe may not have been the first to file patent applications for our product candidates or the compositions we developed or for their uses;\n\u25cf\nothers may independently develop identical, similar or alternative products or compositions and uses thereof;\n\u25cf\nour disclosures in patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability;\n\u25cf\nany or all of our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u25cf\nwe may not seek or obtain patent protection in countries that may eventually provide us a significant business opportunity;\n\u25cf\nany patents issued to us may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf\nour compositions and methods may not be patentable;\n\u25cf\nhers may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside of the scope of our patents;\n\u25cf\nothers may identify prior art or other bases which could invalidate our patents.\nEven if we have or obtain patents covering our product candidates or compositions, we may still be barred from making, using and selling our product candidates or technologies because of the patent rights of others. Others may have filed, and in the future may file, patent applications covering compositions or products that are similar or identical to ours. There are many issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to chemical compounds and therapeutic products, and some of these relate to compounds we intend to commercialize. These could materially affect our ability to develop our product candidates or sell our products if approved. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or compositions may infringe. These patent applications may have priority over patent applications filed by us.\nObtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer.\nLegal actions to enforce our proprietary rights (including patents and trademarks) can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or trademarks or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or other actions against those that have infringed on our patents or trademarks, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nOur failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our Common Stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We must satisfy Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of\u2009$2.5 million or risk delisting, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. A delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities.\nOn November 26, 2021, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, under Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) because our stockholders\u2019 equity of $(6,969,988) as reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2021 was below the required minimum of $2.5 million, and because, as of November 24, 2021, we did not meet the alternative compliance standards, relating to the market value of listed securities of $35 million or net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years.\nOn January 10, 2022, we submitted to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). On February 15, 2022, Nasdaq notified us that they have granted us an extension of up to 180 calendar days from November 26, 2021, or through May 25, 2022, to regain compliance. If we fail to evidence compliance upon filing our periodic report for the quarter ending June 30, 2022 with the SEC, we may be subject to delisting. If Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, we will have the right to appeal to a Nasdaq hearings panel.\nIf our common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, trading of our common stock would most likely take place on an over-the-counter market established for unlisted securities, such as the OTCQB or the Pink Market maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc. An investor would likely find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our common stock on an over-the-counter market, and many investors would likely not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons. In addition, as a delisted security, our common stock would be subject to SEC rules as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers. The regulations relating to penny stocks, coupled with the typically higher cost per trade to the investor of penny stocks due to factors such as broker commissions generally representing a higher percentage of the price of a penny stock than of a higher-priced stock, would further limit the ability of investors to trade in our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities. For these reasons and others, delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and price of our common stock, causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and to raise capital.\nThe limited public market for our securities may adversely affect an investor\u2019s ability to liquidate an investment in us.\nAlthough our Common Stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there is limited trading activity. We can give no assurance that an active market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. If an investor acquires shares of our Common Stock, the investor may not be able to liquidate our shares should there be a need or desire to do so.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may be volatile which could subject us to securities class action litigation and prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the offering price.\nThe market price for our Common Stock has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf\nsales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock, including sales required for us to regain and maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements;\n\u25cf\ndelay or failure in initiating or completing pre-clinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of these trials;\n\u25cf\nannouncements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments concerning our licensors or product manufacturers;\n\u25cf\nlitigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nconditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u25cf\ngovernmental regulation and legislation;\n\u25cf\nvariations in our anticipated or actual operating results;\n\u25cf\nchange in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations; foreign currency values and fluctuations; and\n\u25cf\noverall economic conditions.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Our Series B Preferred Stock carries a dividend rate of 9.0% per year, which is cumulative and continues to accrue on a daily basis whether or not declared and whether or not we have assets legally available therefor. We may pay such dividends at our option either in cash or in kind in additional shares of preferred stock. We do not expect to pay any dividends in cash and have paid accrued dividends in kind in additional shares of preferred stock to date. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our Charter, our amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions of our Charter, our amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nthe inability of stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nadvance notice required for any nomination or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders which requires notice to be delivered to our secretary not later than the close of business on the 90th day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year\u2019s annual meeting, subject to certain exceptions;\n\u25cf\nany vacancies on our board of directors that results from the death, disability, resignation, disqualification or removal of any director or from any other cause shall be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director and shall not be filled by the stockholders; provided that a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the stockholders may be filled by the stockholders; and\n\u25cf\nforum selection provisions that state that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (A) (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Company to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d), the Charter or the by-laws as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware; and (B) the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years, has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price could decline.\nWe currently have Series B Preferred Stock outstanding and may be required to issue additional shares of our Series C Preferred Stock upon the exercise of the Series B Exchange Right. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock.\nOur Board has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval.\nWe currently have approximately 645.20 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding with a stated value of $7,700 per share, which are currently convertible at the holder\u2019s option at any time, together with any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $7.70, subject to certain adjustments.\nOur Series B Preferred Stock gives its holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation and the right to receive dividend payments at 9.00% per annum before dividends are distributed to the holders of Common Stock, among other things. In addition, in the event we effect any issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for cash consideration, or a combination of units thereof, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have the right, subject to certain exceptions, at their option, to exchange (in lieu of cash subscription payments) all or some of the Series B Preferred Stock then held (with a value per share of the Series B Preferred Stock equal to the Series B stated value per share of $7,700 plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon) for any securities or units issued in such issuance on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, also have customary consent rights with respect to certain corporate actions, including the issuance of an increased number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the establishment of any capital stock ranking senior to or on parity the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, the incurrence of indebtedness, and certain changes to our Charter or Bylaws including other actions.\nOur Board created a series of preferred stock designated as Series C Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d), of which 57,000 shares are authorized for issuance, none of which are currently outstanding. Pursuant to the Series B Exchange Right, we may be required to issue shares of Series C Preferred Stock in certain circumstances.\nOur obligations to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and any future holders of any additional series of preferred stock we may issue could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and hinder the accomplishment of our corporate goals.\nIn addition to the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, our Board could authorize the issuance of additional series of preferred stock with such rights preferential to the rights of our Common Stock, including the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our Common Stock or that is convertible into our Common Stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our Common Stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nAs a result of the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d in the Certificate of Designations, Powers, Preferences and Rights of the Series B Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Certificate of Designations\u201d), we may be required to issue additional securities to the investors who purchased shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and related warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock in a private placement in July 2020.\nOn July 16, 2020, we consummated a private placement offering (the \u201cSeries B Private Placement\u201d) in which we issued an aggregate of approximately 2,912.58 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, at a price of $7,700.00 per share, initially convertible into an aggregate of 2,912,576 shares of Common Stock at $7.70 per share, together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,456,283 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.50 per share. The Series B Preferred Stock carries a cumulative dividend at a rate of 9.0% per annum, payable at our option either in cash or in kind in additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nAs a result of previous conversions and exchanges, as of March 28, 2022, 645.20 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were outstanding, with an aggregate stated value of approximately $5,100,000, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through such date of approximately $519,000, and a conversion price of $7.70 per share.\nUnder the Series B Certificate of Designations, in the event we effect any issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for cash consideration, or a combination of units thereof (a \u201cSubsequent Financing\u201d), each holder of the Series B Preferred Stock has the right to exchange the stated value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, of the Series B Preferred Stock for any securities issued in the Subsequent Financing, in lieu of any cash subscription payments therefor (the \u201cSeries B Exchange Right\u201d). As a result of our registered direct offering and private placement consummated in January 2021, as of March 28, 2022, we may be required to issue in the aggregate up to 7,047.48 additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock that would be convertible into up to 704,750 underlying shares of common stock, together with warrants to purchase up to an additional 704,750 shares of our common stock, to any holders of Series B Preferred Stock who elect to exercise their Series B Exchange Right in connection with that offering. Alternatively, as a result of sales of additional shares of common stock made on November 30, 2021, at a price of $2.1657 per share, pursuant to our At The Market Agreement dated May 26, 2021 (the \u201cATM Agreement\u201d)\n(such price being the lowest price per share sold under the ATM Agreement to date), as of March 28, 2022, we may be required to issue in aggregate up to 2,020,785 shares of common stock, with no warrants, to any holders of Series B Preferred Stock who elect to exercise their Series B Exchange Right into shares of common stock. In any event, we anticipate that we would convert any shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to the Series B Exchange Right into underlying shares of common stock immediately upon issuance.\nIn February 2022, we entered into Waivers with certain holders of Series B Preferred Stock, pursuant to which we agreed to pay a cash waiver fee equal to ten percent of the stated value of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder (other than holders who are insiders of our company), and such holder agreed to irrevocably waive its Series B Exchange Right with respect to any Subsequent Financing that occurs from and after the date of the Waiver until December 31, 2022. However, as of February 18, 2022, holders of Series B Preferred Stock holding approximately $2.21 million of stated value of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding did not enter into a Waiver with us. Accordingly, such non-waiving holders may exercise their Series B Exchange Right in connection with the offerings of the Company through December 31, 2022. However, as of March 28, 2022, holders of Series B Preferred Stock holding approximately $2.1 million of stated value of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding did not enter into a Waiver with us. Accordingly, such non-waiving holders may exercise their Series B Exchange Right in connection with the March 2022 Offering. If the holders of Series B Preferred Stock who did not enter into Waivers with us elect to exchange into the March 2022 Offering, up to 1,482,153 additional shares of Common Stock may be issued pursuant to the Series B Exchange Right in excess of amounts currently underlying the Series B Preferred Stock and up to 1,671,395 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants.\nIf the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock exercise their Series B Exchange Rights, it will result in certain dilution to our stockholders, and would afford our stockholders a smaller percentage interest in our voting power, liquidation value and aggregate book value. The sale or resale of the Common Stock issued upon conversion of the preferred stock could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. In addition, the issuance of Common Stock upon the exercise of the Investor Warrants will result in similar dilution to our stockholders. This dilution, or the possibility that it may occur, may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and a price that we deem appropriate.\nTo raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices and other terms that may be more favorable to investors than the terms of our prior offerings that may have been previously approved by our stockholders. As a result, holders of Series B Preferred Stock may become entitled to exercise their Series B Exchange Right in connection with that future offering. This may result in certain dilution to our stockholders and could afford our stockholders a smaller percentage interest in our voting power, liquidation value and aggregate book value. The existence of the Series B Exchange Right may make it more difficult for us to consummate future offerings of our securities at a time and a price that we deem appropriate and may trigger the obligation for the Company to obtain stockholder approval in connection with our future offerings under certain Nasdaq Listing Rules and related guidance.", "PERMNO": 16377, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AZRX"}
