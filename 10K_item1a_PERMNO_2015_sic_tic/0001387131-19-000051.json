RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following factors which may affect future results of operations. If any of the adverse events described below actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and you may lose part or all of the value of your investment. If you choose to invest in our securities, you should be able to bear a complete loss of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nOur business was substantially dependent on the success of squalamine, which failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint in the MAKO Study. Unless we execute on a strategic alternative, we may be required to liquidate, dissolve, or otherwise wind down our operations.\nUntil January 5, 2018, squalamine for the treatment of wet-AMD was our lead product candidate. On January 5, 2018, we announced topline results from our MAKO Study which did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint. Based on these results, we have discontinued further development of squalimine and have been evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. We have no assurance that we will be able to execute on a strategic alternative and may be required to liquidate, dissolve or otherwise wind down our operations if we are unable to do so.\nWe may not be able to monetize the non-squalamine assets, including the SKS sustained release ocular drug delivery platform technology, CEP assets, or our interest in the Depymed joint venture.\nWe may not be able to monetize any or some of the non-squalamine assets, including the SKS sustained release ocular drug delivery platform technology, the CEP assets, or our interest in the Depymed joint venture. In that event, we may be constrained to write off those assets, in whole or in part. At September 30, 2018, we significantly wrote down the value of our SKS sustained release asset and there can be no assurance that we will not be required to further write down or write off the asset entirely in the future.\nWe are subject to securities class action litigation and derivative shareholder litigation. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company.\nAs a result of our announcement of negative results from the MAKO Study, our stock price declined substantially. On February 14, 2018, a securities class action litigation was brought against the Company, Dr. Jason Slakter, Sam Backenroth, and Irach Tarapowela in federal district court in the Southern District of New York. An amended securities class action complaint was filed on August 7, 2018, by lead plaintiffs George Lehman and Insured Benefit Plans, Inc. We dispute these claims and intend to defend the matter vigorously. On September 17, 2018, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On November 13, 2018, plaintiffs filed a motion to strike exhibits appended to the motion to dismiss. A decision on the motion to strike is pending, and the motion to dismiss will then be fully briefed based on a schedule to be determined by the court. This litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s resources and attention, which could harm our business and the value of our common stock.\nOn May 3, 2018, plaintiff Adele J. Barke, derivatively on behalf of the Company, commenced an action in Supreme Court, State of New York against Michael Ferguson, Orin Hirschman, Thomas M. Riedhammer, June Almenoff and Jason Slakter alleging that the action was brought in the right and for the benefit of Ohr seeking to remedy their \u201cbreach of fiduciary duties, corporate waste and unjust enrichment that occurred between June 24, 2014 and the present.\u201d It does not quantify any alleged damages. The Company and the individuals dispute these claims and intend to defend the matter vigorously. Such litigation is currently stayed pursuant to a stipulation by the parties, which has been so ordered by the court, but that status could change. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s resources and attention, which could harm our business and the value of our common stock.\nIn September 2018, plaintiff John Tomson, derivatively and on behalf of the Company, commenced an action against Michael Ferguson, Sam Backenroth, Irach Taraporewala, Orin Hirschman, Thomas M. Riedhammer, June Almenoff and Jason Slakter in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the action was brought in the right and for the benefit of Ohr seeking to remedy their various breaches of fiduciary duties, corporate waste and unjust enrichment that occurred between April 4, 2014 through January 4, 2018. Thereafter, the complaint largely summarized the allegations of the amended complaint filed in the securities class action described above. It does not quantify alleged damages. The Company and the individuals dispute these claims and intend to defend the matter vigorously. Such litigation is currently stayed pursuant to a stipulation by the parties, which has been so ordered by the court, but that status could change. This litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s resources and attention, which could harm the Company\u2019s business and the value of the Company\u2019s common stock. The complaint has not yet been served.\nIf we fail to continue to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nOn February 20, 2018, we received a written notice (the \u201cFirst Notice\u201d) from NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) that the Company had not been in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum closing bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had a period of 180 calendar days, or until August 20, 2018, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement. The Company did not regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement by August 20, 2018. The Company was notified by Nasdaq that it might be afforded a second 180 calendar period to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement under certain circumstances. As a result, the Company applied for an extension of the cure period, as permitted under the notification. In order to cure the deficiency the Company indicated that, to that extent necessary, it planned to seek approval for a reverse stock split in order to meet the minimum closing bid price requirement at a special meeting of the Company\u2019s stockholders which the Company will hold prior to the expiration of the second 180 day period and effectuate the reverse stock split immediately thereafter. On August 21, 2018, we received a written notice from Nasdaq that the Company had been granted an additional 180 calendar days, or until February 19, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum $1.00 bid price per share requirement of the Listing Rules of Nasdaq (\u201cSecond Notice\u201d).\nAccording to the Second Notice, if at any time before February 19, 2019, the bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock closes at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement. If, however, compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement cannot be demonstrated by February 19, 2018, Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company\u2019s common stock will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal Nasdaq\u2019s determination to a Hearings Panel. The Company has filed a definitive proxy statement in connection with special meeting of stockholders to be held on January 18, 2019, at which the Company\u2019s stockholders will vote to approve an amendment to the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company\u2019s common stock at a split ratio of not less than one-for-three and not more than one-for-twenty, to be effective, if at all, at such time as the Company\u2019s Board of Directors shall determine in its sole discretion. We cannot provide any assurances that the stockholders will approve the reverse stock split at the special meeting.\nIf the stockholders do not approve the reverse stock split, and if we were unable to maintain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement and our common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, trading of our common stock would most likely take place on an over-the-counter market established for unlisted securities, such as the OTCQB or the Pink Market maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc. An investor would likely find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our common stock on an over-the-counter market, and many investors would likely not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons. In addition, as a delisted security, our common stock would be subject to SEC rules as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers. The regulations relating to penny stocks, coupled with the typically higher cost per trade to the investor of penny stocks due to factors such as broker commissions generally representing a higher percentage of the price of a penny stock than of a higher-priced stock, would further limit the ability of investors to trade in our common stock. For these reasons and others, delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and price of our common stock, causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, to raise capital, and execute on a strategic alternative.\nThere is no certainty that we will be able to execute on any strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. If we are unable to execute such strategic alternatives, we may be forced to cease operations and liquidate.\nBased on the results of the MAKO study, we began a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. As part of its review of strategic alternatives, the Company formed a special committee of independent directors. The Board of Directors and the special committee have retained Roth Capital Markets, LLC, to advise and assist us in this review. The strategic alternatives that we are exploring, may include some or all of the following: license, divestiture, or monetization of current assets; license or acquisition of additional assets; merger, reverse merger, joint venture, partnership, or other business combination with another entity, public or private. There can be no assurance that this review process will result in a transaction, or that if a transaction does occur, that it will successfully enhance stockholder value. Our expected cash position, net of all liabilities, limits our attractiveness to potential merger candidates and the value that we may receive in such merger, joint venture, partnership, or other business combination scenarios may be less than the current market value of the Company. If we are unable to execute on a strategic alternative, we may be forced to liquidate.\nThe process of exploring strategic alternatives could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could incur substantial expenses associated with identifying, evaluating, and executing on potential strategic alternatives, including those related to equity compensation, severance pay and insurance, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees. In addition, the process may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations, could divert the attention of management and the Board from our business, could negatively impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees, and could expose us to potential litigation in connection with this process or any resulting transaction. Further, speculation regarding any developments related to the review and execution of strategic alternatives and perceived uncertainties related to our future could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly.\nWe have incurred significant losses and anticipate that we will incur additional losses. We might never achieve or sustain revenues.\nWe have experienced significant net losses since our inception. As of September 30, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $121.3 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Such \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to obtain financing.\nOur auditors, MaloneBailey, LLP, have indicated in their report on the Company\u2019s financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon the availability and terms of future funding. If we are unable to achieve this goal, our business would be jeopardized and the Company may not be able to continue. If we ceased operations, it is likely that all of our investors would lose their investment.\nWe depend upon key officers and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel. If we are unable to retain key personnel, it could adversely affect our business. The negative result of the MAKO study and our limited financial resources may make us less successful at retaining employees.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management team, especially our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Jason Slakter, and Vice President of Business Development and Chief Financial Officer, Sam Backenroth, as well as our directors and key consultants. A loss of any of these personnel may have a material adverse effect on aspects of our business.\nThe announcement that we have commenced a review of strategic alternatives may create uncertainty about our prospects as an independent business entity, and make it more difficult to retain qualified executive and other key personnel. The review process may also be costly, time-consuming, divert the attention of management or result in changes in our management team or our board of directors, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business. We may be required to enter into retention agreements with our key employees to ensure execution of a strategic transaction, once such transaction is identified. In addition, our stock price may experience periods of increased volatility as a result of these activities or related rumors and speculation.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe currently do not have, and may never have, any products that generate revenues.\nWe are a development stage pharmaceutical company and currently do not have, and may never have, any products that generate revenues. Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. To date, we have not generated any product revenues.\nWe are highly dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we may finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, and partnerships. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights as holders of our common stock. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions.\nIf we raise capital through a partnership, we may have to relinquish rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to cease operations and liquidate.\nWe are highly dependent upon our ability to enter into agreements with collaborative partners to develop, commercialize, and market any products.\nWe are dependent on strategic partnerships to develop technologies and products. To date, we have not entered into any strategic partnerships for any products. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and these strategic partnerships can be intricate and time consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate strategic partnerships on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any strategic partnerships because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic partnerships.\nWhile our strategy is to partner with an appropriate party, no assurance can be given that any third party would be interested in partnering with us. We currently lack the resources to conduct clinical trials, to manufacture any product candidates on a large scale, and we have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. In the event we are not able to enter into a collaborative agreement with a partner or partners, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may be unable to conduct clinical trials, or to develop products which would have a material adverse effect upon our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if we succeed in securing a partner, the partner collaborators may fail to develop or effectively commercialize products using our technologies. Such partnership would pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf partners may not have sufficient resources or decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as budget limitations, lack of human resources, or a change in strategic focus;\n\u25cf collaborators may believe our intellectual property or the product candidate infringes on the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf partners may dispute their responsibility to conduct development and commercialization activities pursuant to the applicable collaboration, including the payment of related costs or the division of any revenues;\n\u25cf partners may decide to pursue a competitive product developed outside of the partnership arrangement;\n\u25cf partners may not be able to obtain, or believe they cannot obtain, the necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf partners may delay the development or commercialization of any product candidates in favor of developing or commercializing another party\u2019s product candidate; or\n\u25cf partners may decide to terminate or not to renew the collaboration for these or other reasons.\nThus, should the Company ever be successful in entering into a partnership agreement, the agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. Partnership agreements are generally terminable without cause on short notice. We also face competition in seeking out collaborators. If we are unable to secure new partners that achieve the partner\u2019s objectives and meet our expectations, we may be unable to advance any product candidates and may not generate meaningful revenues.\nWe have no experience selling, marketing or distributing products and no internal capability to do so.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and no experience in building a sales force and distribution capabilities. If we are ever in a position to commercialize any products, of which there can be no assurance, we must develop internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which will be expensive and time consuming, or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we decide to market any products directly, we must commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities. Building an in-house marketing and sales force with technical expertise and distribution capabilities will require significant expenditures, management resources and time. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize any products directly and without strategic partners include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any products;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.\nWe may not be successful in recruiting the sales and marketing personnel necessary to sell any products and even if we do build a sales force, they may not be successful in marketing any products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we are ever to conduct additional clinical trials, we would continue to rely on third parties to conduct any such trials for us. If such third parties do not successfully carry out their duties or if we lose our relationships with such third parties, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nWe are dependent on contract research organizations, third-party vendors and independent investigators for preclinical testing, and clinical trials related to any potential drug discovery and development efforts. These parties are not our employees, and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to any programs. If they fail to devote sufficient time and resources to any drug development programs or if their performance is substandard, it would delay the development and commercialization of these product candidates. The parties with which we would contract for execution of our clinical trials would play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. Their failure to achieve their research goals or otherwise meet their obligations on a timely basis could adversely affect clinical development of these product candidates.\nCommunicating with outside parties can also be challenging, potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities. Outside parties may:\n\u25cf have staffing difficulties;\n\u25cf fail to comply with contractual obligations;\n\u25cf experience regulatory compliance issues;\n\u25cf undergo changes in priorities or become financially distressed; or\n\u25cf form relationships with other parties, some of which may be our competitors.\nThese factors may materially adversely affect the willingness or ability of third parties to conduct any clinical trials and may lead to unexpected cost increases. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies would be conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on contract research organizations would not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our contract research organizations would be required to comply with applicable current Good Laboratory Practice (\u201cCGLP\u201d), current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201cCGMP\u201d), and current Good Clinical Practice (\u201cCGCP\u201d) regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these CGCP regulations through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or our contract research organizations fail to comply with applicable CGCP, the clinical data generated in these clinical trials might be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require additional clinical trials before approving the marketing applications. We cannot assure that, upon inspection, the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority will determine that any clinical trials would comply with CGCP. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under CGMP regulations and would require a large number of test subjects. Our failure or the failure of our contract research organizations to comply with these regulations might require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action up to and including civil and criminal penalties.\nIf we are ever to conduct any additional trials and our contract research organizations do not successfully carry out their duties or if we were to lose relationships with contract research organizations, any drug development efforts could be delayed or terminated.\nIf we were to lose relationships with any one or more of these parties, we could experience a significant delay in both identifying another comparable provider and then contracting for its services. We may be unable to retain an alternative provider on reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we locate an alternative provider, it is likely that this provider might need additional time to respond to our needs and might not provide the same type or level of service as the original provider. In addition, any provider that we retain would be subject to CGLP and CGCP, other regulatory standards, and similar foreign standards, and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers. Consequently, if these practices and standards are not adhered to by these providers, the development and commercialization of any products could be delayed, and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to continue or fully exploit our relationships with outside advisors, which could impair our business.\nWe work with advisors who are experts in their respective fields. They advise us with respect to our business and operations. These advisors are not our employees and may have other commitments that would limit their future availability to us. If a conflict of interest arises between their work for us and their work for another entity, we may lose their services, which may impair our reputation in the industry and our business efforts.\nWe have no manufacturing capabilities, and, if needed, would rely completely on third-party manufacturers, which might result in delays in research, development, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product introductions.\nWe have no manufacturing facilities and do not have extensive experience in the manufacturing of drugs or in designing drug manufacturing processes. We would have to contract with third-party manufacturers to produce, in collaboration with us, any products for clinical trials. Our reliance on these third parties for development activities would reduce our control over these activities but would not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required regulations and study and trial protocols. If these third parties were not to successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated study and trial plans and protocols, or if there were disagreements between us and these third parties, we would not be able to initiate, or complete, or may be delayed in completing, the clinical trials required to support future approval of any products. In some such cases, we might need to locate an appropriate replacement third-party relationship, which may not be readily available or with acceptable terms, which would cause additional delay with respect to the approval of products and would thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nContract manufacturers are subject to significant regulatory oversight with respect to manufacturing products. The manufacturing facilities on which we would need to rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and may have limited capacity.\nAny manufacturers of product candidates are obliged to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated CGMPs. In addition, the facilities that would be used by contract manufacturers or other third party manufacturers to manufacture product candidates must be approved by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authority pursuant to inspections that would be conducted after we request regulatory approval from the FDA or other foreign regulatory authority. A failure of any contract manufacturers to establish and follow CGMPs and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in development, or in clinical trials or in obtaining regulatory approval of product candidates or the ultimate launch of products into the market. Furthermore, any contract manufacturers are likely to be engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which exposes them to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may affect the regulatory clearance of the contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities generally. Failure by third-party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of the government to grant pre-market approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions. Many aspects of the clinical trial and manufacturing process are outside of our control. The facilities and quality systems of third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of product candidates. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of product candidates or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities do not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, FDA approval of the products will not be granted.\nThe regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of third-party manufacturers. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or third-party manufacturers to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a manufacturing facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we might contract could materially harm our business.\nDevelopments by competitors may render our technologies obsolete or non-competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Any drug candidates would have to compete with existing therapies and therapies under development by competitors. In addition, the commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective or safer. Other companies have drug candidates in various stages of preclinical or clinical development to treat diseases for which we are also seeking to develop drug products. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development. Even if we are successful in developing effective drugs, they may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors. Most of our competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs, have larger staffing and facilities, and have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u25cf developing drugs;\n\u25cf undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u25cf obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, including foreign regulatory approvals, of drugs;\n\u25cf formulating and manufacturing drugs; and\n\u25cf launching, marketing and selling drugs.\nThese organizations also compete with us for mergers, acquisitions and joint venture candidates and for other collaborations.\nOur employees, partners, independent contractors, consultants, and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, partners, independent contractors, consultants, and vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity with respect to our business. Such misconduct could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates: (1) FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; (2) manufacturing standards; (3) federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (4) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Any incidents or any other conduct that leads to an employee receiving an FDA or other regulatory authority debarment could result in a loss of business from our partners and severe reputational harm. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAny future mergers or acquisitions we make of companies or technologies may result in disruption to our business or distraction of our management.\nWe may merge with, acquire, or make investments in businesses, technologies, services or products if appropriate opportunities arise. From time to time we engage in discussions and negotiations with companies regarding our acquiring or investing in such companies\u2019 businesses, products, services or technologies, in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot be assured that we will be able to identify future suitable merger, acquisition or investment candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates, that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms or at all. If we acquire or merge with another company, we could have difficulty in assimilating that company\u2019s personnel, operations, technology and software. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. If we make other types of acquisitions, we could have difficulty in integrating the acquired products, services or technologies into our operations. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities would be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, and damage our reputation.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such an event could cause interruption of our operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to FDA, Comparable Foreign Regulatory Authority and Healthcare Regulations\nPharmaceutical companies face heavy government regulation. FDA regulatory approval and/or comparable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s approval of any products is uncertain.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing and marketing of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local government authorities, including the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority. To obtain regulatory approval of a product, one must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory agency that, among other things, the product is safe and effective for its intended use. In addition, one must show that the manufacturing facilities used to produce the products are in compliance with CGMP regulations.\nThe process of obtaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals, including foreign regulatory approvals and clearances, would require a substantial amount of time and significant capital expenditure. Despite the time and expense expended, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. The number of preclinical and clinical trials that would be required for FDA approval, or any comparable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s approval, varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition for which the drug candidate is in development, and the requirements applicable to that particular drug candidate. The FDA or other foreign health authority can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including that:\n\u25cf a drug candidate may not be shown to be safe or effective;\n\u25cf the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority may not approve the manufacturing process;\n\u25cf the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority may interpret data from preclinical and clinical trials in different ways; and\n\u25cf the FDA may not meet, or may extend, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act date with respect to a particular NDA.\nIf and when products do obtain marketing approval, the marketing, distribution and manufacture of such products would remain subject to extensive ongoing regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in:\n\u25cf warning letters;\n\u25cf fines;\n\u25cf civil penalties;\n\u25cf injunctions;\n\u25cf recall or seizure of products;\n\u25cf total or partial suspension of production;\n\u25cf refusal of the government to grant future approvals;\n\u25cf withdrawal of approvals; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nWe have not received regulatory approval to market any product candidates in any jurisdiction.\nFollowing regulatory approval of any drug products, ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions might result in significant expense and limit the ability to commercialize any products.\nWith regard to drug candidates, if any, approved by the FDA or by another regulatory authority, including a foreign regulatory authority, we would be held to extensive regulatory requirements over product manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping. Regulatory approvals may also be subject to significant limitations on the indicated uses or marketing of the drug candidates. Potentially costly follow-up or post-marketing clinical studies may be required as a condition of approval to further substantiate safety or efficacy, or to investigate specific issues of interest to the regulatory authority. Previously unknown problems with the drug candidate, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the drug, and could include withdrawal of the drug from the market.\nIn addition, the law or regulatory policies governing pharmaceuticals may change. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or elsewhere. If we were not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we might not be permitted to market any drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position.\nHealthcare policy changes, including proposals to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may harm our future business.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. There have been and continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to keep these costs down. Certain proposals, if passed, would impose limitations on the prices we would be able to charge for products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies and third party payors. These limitations could in turn reduce the amount of investment into development, and the amount of revenues that we would be able to generate in the future from sales of products and licenses of our technology.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, together, the Healthcare Reform Act, is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals, the provision of subsidies to eligible individuals enrolled in plans offered on the health insurance exchanges, and the expansion of the Medicaid program. This law has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act imposes an annual fee, which will increase annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers starting in 2011. The financial impact of these discounts, increased rebates and fees and the other provisions of the legislation on our business is unclear and there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected. In addition, these and other ongoing initiatives in the United States have increased and will continue to increase pressure on drug pricing. The announcement or adoption of any government initiatives could have an adverse effect on potential revenues from any product that we may successfully develop.\nMoreover, additional legislative or regulatory changes remain possible and appear likely. In this regard, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or U.S. Tax Act, signed into law in December 2017, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Healthcare Reform Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The nature and extent of any additional legislative or regulatory changes to the Healthcare Reform Act are uncertain at this time. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally. In addition to the Healthcare Reform Act, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third party payors to keep healthcare costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits.\nVarious healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. However, an expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower the revenues for future products and adversely affect our future business, possibly materially.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to compete may be undermined if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success depends on obtaining and maintaining proprietary rights to product candidates and technologies and their uses, as well as successfully defending these rights against third-party challenges. We will be able to most effectively protect product candidates, technologies, and their uses from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents, or effectively protected trade secrets, cover them. Nonetheless, the issued patents and patent applications covering our technologies remain subject to uncertainty due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf we may not have been the first to make one or more of the inventions covered by our pending patent applications or issued patents;\n\u25cf we may not have been the first to file patent applications for one or more of our technologies we rely upon;\n\u25cf others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u25cf our disclosures in a particular patent application may be determined to be insufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability;\n\u25cf one or more of our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u25cf we may not seek or obtain patent protection in all countries that will eventually provide a significant business opportunity;\n\u25cf one or more patents issued to us or to our collaborators may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf we may fail to file for patent protection in all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be necessary or fail to comply with other procedural, documentary, fee payment or other provisions during the patent process in any such country, and we may be precluded from filing at a later date or may lose some or all patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction;\n\u25cf one or more of our technologies may not be patentable;\n\u25cf others may design around one or more of our patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside of the scope of our patents;\n\u25cf others may identify prior art which could invalidate our patents; or\n\u25cf changes to patent laws may limit the exclusivity rights of patent holders.\nEven if we have or obtain patents covering our technologies, we may still be barred from making, using and selling one or more of our technologies because of the patent rights of others. Others have or may have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering compounds, assays, therapeutic products and delivery systems, including sustained release delivery, that are similar or identical to ours. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the area of medical disorders. These could materially affect our ability to develop products. Because patent applications can take years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that our technologies may infringe. These patent applications may have priority over one or more patent applications filed by us.\nIf our competitors have prepared and filed patent applications in the United States that claim technology we also claim, we may have to participate in interference proceedings required by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs, even if we ultimately prevail. Results of interference proceedings are highly unpredictable and may result in us having to try to obtain licenses in order to develop or market drug products.\nDisputes may arise regarding the ownership or inventorship of our inventions. It is difficult to determine how such disputes would be resolved. Others may challenge the validity of our patents. If one or more of our patents are found to be invalid, we will lose the ability to exclude others from making, using or selling the inventions claimed therein.\nResearch collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights. Additionally, employees whose positions may be eliminated may seek future employment with our competitors. Each of our employees is required to sign a confidentiality agreement and invention assignment agreement with us at the time of hire. While such arrangements are intended to enable us to better control the use and disclosure of our proprietary property and provide for our ownership of proprietary technology developed on our behalf, they may not provide us with meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. In addition, technology that we may in-license may become important to some aspects of our business. We generally will not control all of the patent prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of in-licensed technology.\nWe rely on confidentiality agreements that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position.\nOur policy is to enter into agreements relating to the non-disclosure of confidential information with third parties, including our contractors, consultants, advisors and research collaborators, as well as agreements that purport to require the disclosure and assignment to us of the rights to the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we employ them. However, these agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. Moreover, to the extent that our contractors, consultants, advisors and research collaborators apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to this type of information. If a dispute arises, a court may determine that the right belongs to a third party, and enforcement of our rights can be costly and unpredictable. In addition, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we will seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, consultants, advisors or others. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Despite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that:\n\u25cf these agreements may be breached;\n\u25cf these agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach; or\n\u25cf our trade secrets or proprietary know-how will otherwise become known.\nAny breach of our confidentiality agreements or our failure to effectively enforce such agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be forced to pay damages and required to defend against litigation which could result in substantial costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have not received to date any claims of infringement by any third parties. However, should our public profile be raised, such infringement claims may be more likely. Defending against such claims, and an occurrence of a judgment adverse to us, could result in unanticipated costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of our technologies, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to:\n\u25cf obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf redesign products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u25cf stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u25cf defend litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of management resources; or\n\u25cf pay damages.\nAny costs incurred in connection with such events or the inability to develop products may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIntellectual property litigation is increasingly common and increasingly expensive and may result in restrictions on our business and substantial costs, even if we prevail.\nPatent and other intellectual property litigation is becoming more common in the pharmaceutical industry. Litigation is sometimes necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patent rights, including those we have licensed from others, to protect trade secrets or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights of third parties. Currently, no third party is asserting that we are infringing upon their patent rights or other intellectual property, nor are we aware or believe that we are infringing upon any third party\u2019s patent rights or other intellectual property. We may, however, be infringing upon a third party\u2019s patent rights or other intellectual property, and litigation asserting such claims might be initiated in which we would not prevail, or we would not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on reasonable terms, if at all. All such litigation, whether meritorious or not, as well as litigation initiated by us against third parties, is time-consuming and very expensive to defend or prosecute and to resolve. In addition, if we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture or sell products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling products, which could harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nA dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business.\nThere is significant litigation in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we are not currently subject to any pending intellectual property litigation, and are not aware of any such threatened litigation, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If any drug development activities are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses to such patents. If any products are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses to such patents. A patentee could prevent us from making, using or selling the patented compounds. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us, protect our trade secrets or determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. From time to time, we may hire scientific personnel formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities conducted by us. Either we or these individuals may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of their prior affiliations. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. We also may not be able to afford the costs of litigation.\nThe patent applications of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies involve highly complex legal and factual questions, which, if determined adversely to us, could negatively impact our patent position.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s standards are uncertain and could change in the future. Consequently, the issuance and scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference or derivation proceedings, and U.S. patents may be subject to inter partes review, post grant review and ex parte reexamination proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (and foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office), which proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. Similarly, opposition or invalidity proceedings could result in loss of rights or reduction in the scope of one or more claims of a patent in foreign jurisdictions. Such interference, inter partes review, post grant review and ex parte reexamination and opposition proceedings may be costly. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or processes.\nChanges in or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign countries may permit others to develop and commercialize our technology without providing any compensation to us or may limit the number of patents or claims we can obtain. In particular, there have been proposals to shorten the exclusivity periods available under U.S. patent law that, if adopted, could substantially harm our business. If the exclusivity period for patents is shortened, then our ability to generate revenues without competition would be reduced and our business could be materially adversely impacted. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws, and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights. For example, some countries, including many in Europe, do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans and, in these countries, patent protection may not be available at all to protect product candidates. In addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect our technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders. For example, the LeahySmith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was recently signed into law and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include changes to transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and to the way issued patents are challenged. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have more resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has been in the process of implementing regulations and procedures to administer the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act may affect our ability to obtain, enforce or defend our patents. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the LeahySmith Act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend our issued patents.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection of any product candidates, proprietary technologies and their uses, we could lose our competitive advantage and competition we face would increase, reducing our potential revenues and adversely affecting our ability to attain profitability.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price and volume of our common stock fluctuate significantly and could result in substantial losses for individual investors.\nThe stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price and volume of our common stock to decrease. In addition, the market price and volume of our common stock is highly volatile.\nFactors that may cause the market price and volume of our common stock to decrease include:\n\u25cf delisting or other changes in status of Nasdaq listing (See Risk Factor entitled, \u201cIf we fail to continue to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\u201d);\n\u25cf changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock or lack of analyst coverage;\n\u25cf fluctuations in our results of operations, timing and announcements of our corporate news;\n\u25cf developments concerning discussions that we may be in, or enter into, regarding strategic alliances, partnerships, reverse mergers, mergers, acquisitions, or similar transactions;\n\u25cf adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to any drug products, clinical trials, manufacturing processes or sales and marketing activities;\n\u25cf any lawsuit involving us or any drug products;\n\u25cf developments with respect to our patents and proprietary rights;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations by our competitors;\n\u25cf public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others;\n\u25cf regulatory developments in the United States and in foreign countries;\n\u25cf the pharmaceutical industry conditions generally and general market conditions;\n\u25cf failure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and five percent stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles; and\n\u25cf loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nThe market for our common stock is illiquid. Our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the purchase price paid by such stockholders, or at all.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. The market for our securities is illiquid. This illiquidity may be caused by a variety of factors including:\n\u25cf lower trading volume;\n\u25cf low stock price; and\n\u25cf market conditions.\nThere is limited trading in our common stock and our security holders may experience wide fluctuations in the market price of our securities. Such price and volume fluctuations have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These price and volume fluctuations often appear to have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These fluctuations may have an extremely negative effect on the market price of our securities and may prevent a stockholder from obtaining a market price equal to the purchase price such stockholder paid when the stockholder attempts to sell our securities in the open market. In these situations, the stockholder may be required either to sell our securities at a market price which is lower than the purchase price the stockholder paid, or to hold our securities for a longer period of time than planned. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company may avail itself of reduced disclosure requirements, which may make the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nBecause the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock as of the end of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter was less than $75 million, the Company is a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company has relied on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies. The Company may continue to rely on such exemptions for so long as the Company remains a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d These exemptions include reduced financial disclosure, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company\u2019s reliance on these exemptions may result in the public finding the Company\u2019s common stock to be less attractive and adversely impact the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock or the trading market thereof.\nWe will not pay cash dividends and investors may have to sell their shares in order to realize their investment.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to use our cash for reinvestment in the development and marketing of products, technologies, and services. As a result, investors may have to sell their shares of common stock to realize any of their investment.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder (\u201cSection 404\u201d). Section 404 requires us to report on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. In the past, our management has identified certain \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in our internal controls over financial reporting which we believe have been remediated. However, any failure to maintain effective controls could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, and cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. We may also be required to incur costs to improve our internal control system and hire additional personnel. This could negatively impact our results of operations.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and divert management\u2019s attention from operating our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere have been other changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in addition to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as new regulations promulgated by the Commission and rules promulgated by the national securities exchanges. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Our board members, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, we may incur additional expenses to comply with standards set by regulatory authorities or governing bodies which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDelaware law could discourage a change in control, or an acquisition of the Company by a third party, even if the acquisition would be favorable to stockholders.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of the Company, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders. Delaware law imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders.\u201d These provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of common stock over then current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue Serial Preferred Stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and may delay or prevent a takeover that could be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nThe Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 9,416,664 shares of Serial Preferred Stock, $.0001 par value per share (the \u201cSerial Preferred Stock\u201d) (after giving effect to the conversion and cancellation of a previous issue of 5,583,336 shares of Series B Preferred), in one or more series and to fix the number of shares constituting any such series, the voting powers, designation, preferences and relative participation, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including the dividend rights and dividend rate, terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption price or prices, conversion rights and liquidation preferences of the shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. 6,000,000 shares of the Serial Preferred Stock, designated the Series B Preferred, have been authorized, 5,583,336 were issued and, as of the date of this filing, all such shares have been converted and no Series B Preferred shares remain issued and outstanding. The issuance of additional Serial Preferred Stock could affect the rights of the holders of Common Stock. For example, such issuance could result in a class of securities outstanding that would have preferential voting, dividend, and liquidation rights over the Common Stock, and could (upon conversion or otherwise) enjoy all of the rights appurtenant to the shares of common stock. The authority possessed by the Board of Directors to issue Serial Preferred Stock could potentially be used to discourage attempts by others to obtain control of the Company through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult or costly to achieve. The Board of Directors may issue the Serial Preferred Stock without stockholder approval and with voting and conversion rights which could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock. There are no agreements or understandings for the issuance of Serial Preferred Stock and the Board of Directors has no present intention to issue any Serial Preferred Stock.", "PERMNO": 13965, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "NBSE"}
