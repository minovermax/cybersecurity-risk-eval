{"cik": "1130464", "company": "BLACK HILLS CORP /SD/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks. Risks that may adversely affect the business operations, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. These risk factors, along with other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nOur continued success is dependent on execution of our strategic business plans including our growth strategy.\nOur success depends, in significant part, on our ability to execute our strategic business plans, including our growth strategy. Our plans and strategy include reducing GHG emissions for our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities, transforming the customer experience, growing our electric and natural gas customer load, pursuing operating efficiencies and modernizing our utility infrastructure. Our current plans and strategy may be negatively impacted by disruptive forces and innovations in the marketplace, changing political, business or regulatory conditions, and technology advancements.\nIn addition, we have significant capital investment programs planned for the next five years that are key to our strategic business plans. The successful execution of our capital investment program depends on, or could be affected by, a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: weather conditions, effective management of projects, availability of qualified construction personnel including contractors, changes in commodity and other prices, availability of materials, governmental approvals and permitting, regulatory cost recovery and return on investment.\nAn inability to successfully and timely adapt to changing conditions and execute our strategic plans, including our growth strategy could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nCustomer growth and usage in our service territories may fluctuate with economic conditions, emerging technologies or responses to price increases.\nOur financial operating results are impacted by energy demand in our service territories. Customer growth and usage may be impacted by a number of factors, including the voluntary reduction in consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and energy efficiency programs, electrification initiatives that could negatively impact the demand for natural gas, economic conditions impacting customers\u2019 disposable income and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies. Continued technological improvements may make customer and third-party distributed generation and energy storage systems, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, solar cells and batteries, more cost effective and feasible for our customers. If more customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us would decline. Such developments could affect the price of energy and delivery of energy, require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Each of these factors could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nREGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS\nWe may be subject to future laws, regulations, or actions associated with climate change, including those relating to fossil-fuel generation and GHG emissions, which could increase our operating costs or restrict our market opportunities.\nWe own and operate regulated and unregulated electric power plants that burn fossil fuels (natural gas and coal) and a surface mine that extracts and sells coal. We also purchase, store and deliver natural gas to our customers. These business activities are subject to evolving public concern regarding fossil fuels, GHG emissions (such as carbon dioxide and methane) and their impact on the climate.\nThere is uncertainty surrounding climate regulation due to legal challenges to some current regulations and anticipated new federal and/or state climate legislation and regulation. The Biden administration has issued executive orders aimed at reducing GHG emissions and declared climate change a national security policy for the first time. New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or capacity reductions of coal-fired power generation facilities and potential increased production from our combined cycle natural gas-fired generating units. Increased rules and regulations associated with fossil fuels and GHG emissions could result in the impairment or retirement of some of our existing or future transmission, distribution, generation and natural gas storage facilities or our coal mine. Further, these rules could create the need to purchase or build clean-energy fuel sources to fulfill obligations to our customers. These actions could also result in increased operating costs which could adversely impact customers and our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. We cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nFuture GHG constraints designed to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise result in increased costs and affect the demand for natural gas as well as the prices charged to customers and the competitive position of natural gas. Certain cities in our operational footprint are focused on electrification and have adopted initiatives to prohibit the construction of new natural gas distribution facilities. Any such initiatives and legislation could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to unfavorable or untimely federal and state regulatory outcomes.\nOur regulated Electric and Gas Utilities are subject to cost-of-service/rate-of-return regulation and earnings oversight from federal and eight state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our customer rates are regulated by either the FERC or the respective state utility regulatory authority based on an analysis of our costs and investments, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that our various regulatory authorities will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will result in full or timely recovery of our costs and the allowed return on invested capital. In addition, adverse rate decisions, including rate moratoriums, rate refunds, limits on rate increases, lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions, could be influenced by competitive, economic, political, legislative, public perception and regulatory pressures and adversely impact results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEach of our Electric and Gas Utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs or integrity capital investments) outside of a base rate review in order to stabilize customer rates and reduce regulatory lag. If regulators decide to discontinue these tariff-based recovery mechanisms, it could negatively impact results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCosts could significantly increase to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future environmental laws, regulations or requirements.\nOur business segments are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions (i.e. SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and GHG), water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the business segments to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure or inability to comply with evolving environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets.\nOur business segments may not be successful in recovering increased capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers. More stringent environmental laws or regulations could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or impede the development of new facilities. Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business segments\u2019 financial position, results of operations or cash flows, future environmental compliance costs could have a significant negative impact.\nLegislative and regulatory requirements may lead to increased costs and result in compliance penalties.\nBusiness activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government. Many agencies employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. The FERC, NERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nMunicipal governments may seek to limit or deny our franchise privileges.\nMunicipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries. We regularly engage in negotiations on renewals of franchise agreements with our municipal governments. We have from time to time faced challenges or ballot initiatives on franchise renewals. To date, we have been successful in resolving or defending each of these challenges. Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain. If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation. We also cannot quantify the impact that such action would have on the remainder of our business operations.\nChanges in Federal tax law may significantly impact our business.\nWe are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we do business. Similar to the TCJA, sweeping legislation or regulation could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities which may affect our tax burden. Changes may include numerous provisions that affect businesses, including changes to U.S. corporate tax rates, business-related exclusions, and deductions and credits. The outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which the effect of a change in corporate tax rate will impact our utility customers and the time period over which the impact will occur could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows. Separately, a challenge by a taxing authority, changes in taxing authorities\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates.\nOPERATING RISKS\nOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems, natural gas storage facilities, and a coal mine.\nThe risks associated with management of these operations include:\n\u2022Inherent dangers. Electricity and natural gas can be dangerous to employees and the general public. Failures of or contact with power lines, natural gas pipelines or service facilities and equipment may result in fires, explosions, property damage and personal injuries, including death. While we maintain liability and property insurance coverage, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. The occurrence of any of these events may not be fully covered by our insurance;\n\u2022Weather, natural conditions and disasters. Severe weather events, such as snow and ice storms, fires, tornadoes, strong winds, significant thunderstorms, flooding and drought, could negatively impact operations, including our ability to provide energy safely, reliably and profitably and our ability to complete construction, expansion or refurbishment of facilities as planned;\n\u2022Acts of sabotage, terrorism or other malicious attacks. Damage to our facilities due to deliberate acts could lead to outages or other adverse effects;\n\u2022Operating hazards. Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including fires or explosions could impact employee and public safety, reliability and customer confidence;\n\u2022Equipment and processes. Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, unavailability or increased cost of equipment, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency could negatively impact our results of operations;\n\u2022Disrupted transmission and distribution. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers. If transmission is interrupted physically, mechanically, or with cyber means, our ability to sell or deliver utility services and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;\n\u2022Natural gas supply for generation and distribution. Our regulated utilities and non-regulated entities purchase natural gas from a number of suppliers for our generating facilities and for distribution to our customers. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by the lack of availability and cost of natural gas, and disruptions in the delivery of natural gas due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations;\n\u2022Replacement power. The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages of generation facilities could negatively impact our results of operations;\n\u2022Governmental permits. The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals could negatively impact our ability to operate\nand our results of operations;\n\u2022Operational limitations. Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements and contractual agreements, including those that restrict the timing of generation plant scheduled outages, could negatively impact our results of operations;\n\u2022Increased costs. Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations; unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and unanticipated cost overruns could negatively impact our results of operations;\n\u2022Labor and labor relations. The cost of recruiting and retaining skilled technical labor or the unavailability of such resources could have a negative impact on our operations. Our ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees is a risk; at December 31, 2020, approximately 23% of our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities employees were eligible for regular or early retirement. Our ability to avoid or minimize supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes is also a risk; approximately 25% of our employees are represented by unions;\n\u2022Public opposition. Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups could negatively impact our ability to operate our businesses; and\nThe ongoing operation of our business involves the risks described above, in addition to risks associated with threats to our overall business model, such as electrification initiatives. Any of these risks could cause us to experience negative financial results and damage to our reputation and public confidence. These risks could cause us to incur significant costs or be unable to deliver energy and/or operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties. While we maintain insurance and obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under contracts, warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.\nCyberattacks, terrorism, or other malicious acts targeting our key technology systems could disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information.\nTo effectively operate our business, we rely upon a sophisticated electronic control system, information and operation technology systems and network infrastructure to generate, distribute and deliver energy, and collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees. Cyberattacks, terrorism or other malicious acts targeting electronic control systems could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations. Attacks targeting other key technology systems, including our third-party vendors\u2019 information systems, could further add to a full or partial disruption of our operations. Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and associated revenues, as well as significant expense to repair damages and remedy security breaches. In addition, any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.\nWe have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets, including certain safeguards required by FERC. Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our technology systems may still be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access.\nWeather conditions, including the impacts of climate change, may cause fluctuation in customer usage.\nOur utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather conditions and patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers\u2019 energy use could increase or decrease. Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating, respectively. Demand for natural gas depends heavily upon winter-weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Demand for natural gas is also impacted by summer weather patterns that are cooler than normal and provide higher than normal precipitation; both of which can reduce natural gas demand for irrigation. Unusually mild summers and winters, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our financial operating results, including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nA sub-investment grade credit rating could impact our ability to access capital markets.\nOur issuer credit rating is Baa2 (Stable outlook) by Moody\u2019s; BBB+ (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Stable outlook) by Fitch. Reduction of our investment grade credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and complete new financings on reasonable terms, if at all. A credit rating downgrade, particularly to sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts. In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities, potentially significantly increasing our cost of capital and other associated operating costs which may not be recoverable through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments as hedges against commodity prices and financial market risks could result in material financial losses.\nWe use various financial and physical derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and interest rate risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities being hedged. For Black Hills Energy Services under the Choice Gas Program, and in certain instances within our regulated Utilities where unrealized and realized gains and losses from derivative instruments are not approved for regulatory accounting treatment, fluctuating commodity prices may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to mark-to-market accounting treatment.\nTo the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.\nAdditionally, our exchange-traded futures contracts are subject to futures margin posting requirements. To the extent we are unable to meet these requirements, this could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt. Further, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.\nWe have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries. Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.\nAs a holding company, our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds.\nThere is no assurance as to the amount, if any, of future dividends to the holding company because these subsidiaries depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. See \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d within Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Note 9 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.\nOur ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital. Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt, pay dividends and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales. Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.\nIn addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service. Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.\nNational and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts.\nA future recession or pandemic, if one occurs, may lead to an increase in late payments or non-payment from retail residential, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as from our non-utility customers. If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.\nWe may be unable to obtain insurance coverage, and the coverage we currently have may not apply or may be insufficient to cover a significant loss.\nOur ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be impacted by developments affecting the insurance industry and the financial condition of insurers. Additionally insurance providers could deny coverage or decline to extend coverage under the same or similar terms that are presently available to us. A loss for which we are not adequately insured could materially affect our financial results. The coverage we currently have in place may not apply to a particular loss, or it may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including liability and losses associated with wildfire, natural gas and gas storage field explosions, cyber-security breaches, environmental hazards and natural disasters.\nMarket performance or changes in key valuation assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans.\nAssumptions related to interest rates, expected return on investments, mortality and other key actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans. An adverse change to key assumptions associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may require significant unplanned contributions to the plans which could adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nCosts associated with our healthcare plans and other benefits could increase significantly.\nThe costs of providing healthcare benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to healthcare plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. Significant regulatory developments have required, and likely will continue to require, changes to our current employee benefit plans and supporting administrative processes. Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits. As benefit costs continue to rise, there is no assurance that the state utility commissions will allow recovery of these increased costs. The rising employee benefit costs, or inadequate recovery of such costs, may adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow, or liquidity.\nPANDEMIC RISK\nOur business operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nWe have responded to the global pandemic of COVID-19 by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks to us posed by its spread.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a limited net financial impact on our business operations, financial condition and cash flows. In particular, we experienced:\n\u2022Increased allowance for credit losses and bad debt expense due to anticipated customer non-payment as a result of suspended disconnections;\n\u2022Increased costs due to sequestration of mission-critical and essential employees;\n\u2022Lower commercial and certain transport volumes partially offset by higher electric and natural gas residential usage;\n\u2022Waived customer late payment fees;\n\u2022Reduced availability of our employees;\n\u2022Increased costs for personal protection equipment and cleaning supplies;\n\u2022Minimal disruptions receiving the materials and supplies necessary to maintain operations and continue executing our capital investment plan;\n\u2022Minimal impacts to the availability of our contractors;\n\u2022Minimal decline in the funded status of our pension plan;\n\u2022Minimal interest expense increase due to disruptions in the Commercial Paper markets; and\n\u2022Reduced training, travel, and outside services related expenses.\nShould the COVID-19 pandemic continue for a prolonged period or impact the areas we serve more significantly than it has to date, our business operations, financial condition and cash flows could be impacted in more significant ways. In addition to exacerbating the impacts described above, we could experience:\n\u2022Adverse impacts on our strategic business plans, growth strategy and capital investments;\n\u2022Increased adverse impacts to electricity and natural gas demand from our customers, particularly from commercial and industrial customers;\n\u2022Further reduction in the availability of our employees and contractors;\n\u2022Increased costs as a result of our preventative measures, such as sequestration of essential employees and facility cleaning services;\n\u2022Increased allowance for credit losses and bad debt expense as a result of delayed or non-payment from our customers, both of which could be magnified by Federal or state government legislation that requires us to extend suspensions of disconnections for non-payment;\n\u2022Delays and disruptions in the availability, timely delivery and cost of materials and components used in our operations;\n\u2022Disruptions in the commercial operation dates of certain projects impacting qualification criteria for certain tax credits and triggering potential damages under our power purchase agreements;\n\u2022Deterioration of the credit quality of our counterparties, including gas commodity contract counterparties, power purchase agreement counterparties, contractors or retail customers, that could result in credit losses;\n\u2022Impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets;\n\u2022Adverse impacts on our ability to construct and operate facilities;\n\u2022Inability to meet the requirements of the covenants in our existing credit facilities, including covenants regarding Consolidated Indebtedness to Capitalization Ratio;\n\u2022Deterioration in our financial metrics or the business environment that adversely impacts our credit ratings;\n\u2022Delay in the permitting process of certain development projects, affecting the timing of final investment decisions and start dates of construction;\n\u2022Adverse impact on our liquidity position and cost of and ability to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets; and\n\u2022Delays in our ability to change rates through regulatory proceedings.\nTo date, we have experienced limited impacts to our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or business plans. However, the situation remains fluid and it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 61946, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "BKH"}
