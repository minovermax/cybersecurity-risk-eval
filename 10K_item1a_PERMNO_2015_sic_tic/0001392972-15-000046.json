{"cik": "1392972", "company": "PROS Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a dynamic environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The following section describes some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock; these risks are not necessarily listed in terms of their importance or level of risk.\nRisks relating to our business and industry:\nWe may not be able to achieve our key initiatives and grow our business as anticipated.\nWhile we currently intend to grow our business by pursuing key initiatives to broaden our product platform through internal development and acquisitions; increase our sales capacity by expanding our direct sales organization and developing our channel partnerships; expand our scale through system integrators; and employ marketing programs to increase awareness of our company and our big data products among existing and prospective customers, we may not be able to achieve these key initiatives. Our success depends on our ability to: appropriately manage our expenses as we grow our organization; identify or acquire companies or assets at attractive valuations; enter into and maintain beneficial channel relationships; develop new products; and successfully execute our marketing and sales strategies. If we are not able to execute on these actions, our business may not grow as we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nAs we expand our software product portfolio, we could face increased competition as part of entering new markets.\nThe market for our products is competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future as we expand our product portfolio and features. We may not compete successfully against future potential competitors, especially those with significantly greater financial resources or brand name recognition. For example, we now compete with sales enablement, configure-price-quote and to a lesser extent, rebate management software. Large companies in these spaces may have advantages over us because of their greater brand name recognition, larger customer bases, broader product portfolios, larger distribution channels, or greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements.\nIf our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our results of operations and competitive position could suffer.\nWe spend substantial amounts of time and money to enhance of our existing products, as well as to research and develop new products. We introduce new products and incorporate additional features, improve functionality or add other enhancements to our existing products in order to meet our customers' demands. Our new products or enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\u2022delays in introducing new, enhanced or modified products;\n\u2022defects, errors or failures in any of our products;\n\u2022inability to operate effectively with the networks of our prospective customers;\n\u2022inability to protect against new types of attacks or techniques used by hackers;\n\u2022negative publicity about the performance or effectiveness of our network security products;\n\u2022reluctance of customers to purchase products based on open source software; and\n\u2022disruptions or delays in the availability and delivery of our products.\nIf our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position could be impaired, our revenue could be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research and development, marketing, sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product.\nWe focus primarily on big data sales, pricing and revenue management software, and if the markets for this software develop more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed.\nWe derive most of our revenue from providing our sales, pricing and revenue management software solutions, implementation services and ongoing customer support. The sales and pricing market is evolving rapidly, and it is uncertain whether this software could achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success would depend on the willingness of businesses in the manufacturing, distribution, services industries to use sales and pricing software.\nSome businesses may be reluctant or unwilling to implement sales and pricing software for a number of reasons, including failure to understand the potential returns of improving their processes and lack of knowledge about the potential benefits that such software may provide. Even if businesses recognize the need for improved sales and/or pricing processes, they may not select our solutions because they previously have made investments in internally developed solutions. Some businesses may elect to improve their pricing processes through solutions obtained from their existing enterprise software providers, whose solutions are designed principally to address functional areas other than pricing. These enterprise solutions may appeal to customers that wish to limit the number of software vendors on which they rely and the number of different types of solutions used to run their businesses.\nIf businesses do not embrace the benefits of sales and pricing software, the sales and pricing software market may not continue to develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly and adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Because the sales and pricing software market is developing and the manner of its development is difficult to predict, we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our operating results.\nCompetition from vendors of big data sales, pricing, revenue management and configure-price-quote solutions and enterprise applications as well as from companies internally developing their own solutions could adversely affect our ability to sell our solutions and could result in pressure to price our solutions in a manner that reduces our margins and harms our operating results.\nThe sales, pricing, revenue management and configure-price-quote software market is competitive and rapidly evolving. Our software solutions compete with both solutions developed internally by businesses as well as those solutions offered by competitors. We believe our principal competition consists of:\n\u2022\npricing, quoting, rebate and revenue management software vendors, including a number of vendors that provide such software for specific industries; and\n\u2022\nlarge enterprise application providers that have developed offerings that include sales, pricing and revenue management functionality.\nWe expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies to the extent the sales, pricing, revenue management and configure-price-quote software market continues to develop and expand. We also expect competition to increase as a result of the entrance of new competitors in the market and industry consolidation, including through a merger or partnership of two or more of our competitors or the acquisition of a competitor by a larger company, such as Oracle through its acquisition of BigMachines. A number of our current and potential competitors have larger installed bases of users, longer operating histories, broader distribution and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, many of these companies have significantly greater resources than we have. As a result, these companies may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.\nCompetition could seriously impede our ability to sell our software solutions and services on terms favorable to us. We do not know how our competition could set prices for their products. Businesses may internally develop solutions, rather than invest in commercially-available solutions. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future solutions obsolete, unmarketable or less competitive. In addition, if these competitors develop solutions with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, or if they offer solutions with similar functionality at a substantially lower price than our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our solutions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our current solutions, services and maintenance pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins could be reduced and our operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot provide assurance that we would be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures could not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data or our data or our IT systems, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our solutions and/or we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur solutions and services involve the storage, and to a more limited extent, the transmission of our customers\u2019 proprietary information. Despite the implementation of security measures, these systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, malicious software programs, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems, and could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Because the techniques used to compromise systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Malicious third-parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our solutions and services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business, increase our information security costs, and lead to legal liability.\nWe are subject to a lengthy sales cycle and delays or failures to complete sales may harm our business and cause our revenue and operating income to decline in the future.\nOur sales cycle may take several months to over a year. To sell our solutions successfully and obtain an executed contract, we often have to educate our potential customers about the benefits of our solutions. We expend substantial resources during our sales cycles with no assurance that a sale may ultimately result. The length of each individual sales cycle depends on many factors, a number of which we cannot control. These factors include the customer\u2019s requirements, the level of competition we face for that customer\u2019s business, and the customer's internal approval processes. Any unexpected lengthening of the sales cycle or failure to secure anticipated orders could negatively affect our revenue. Furthermore, a delay in our ability to obtain a signed agreement or to complete certain contract requirements in a particular quarter could materially reduce our revenue in that quarter. Any significant failure to generate revenue or delays in recognizing revenue after incurring costs related to our sales or services process could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny unauthorized, and potentially improper, actions of our personnel could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe recognition of our revenue depends on, among other things, the terms negotiated in our contracts with our customers. Our personnel may act outside of their authority and negotiate additional terms without our knowledge. We have implemented policies to help prevent and discourage such conduct, but there can be no assurance that such policies would be followed. For instance, in the event that our sales personnel negotiate terms that do not appear in the contract and of which we are unaware, whether such additional terms are written or verbal, we could be prevented from recognizing revenue in accordance with our plans. Furthermore, depending on when we learn of unauthorized actions and the size of the transactions involved, we may have to restate revenue for a previously reported period, which could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe made our first two acquisitions in late 2013 and early 2014, and in the future may continue to enter into acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, fail to achieve our strategic objectives, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.\nWe made our first two acquisitions in late 2013 and early 2014, and in the future may continue to acquire businesses, technologies and products that we intend to complement our existing business, solutions, services and technologies. We cannot provide assurance that the acquisitions we have made or may make in the future could provide us with the benefits or achieve the results we anticipated when entering into the transaction. Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies, including integrating financial reporting and operating systems, particularly with respect to foreign and/or public subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ndisruption of ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our solutions and services;\n\u2022\nunexpected expenses resulting from the acquisition; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the acquisition.\nIn addition, we may incur debt, acquisition-related costs and expenses, restructuring charges and write-offs as a result of acquisitions. Acquisitions may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges.\nOur recent acquisitions have required, and may continue to require, significant management time and attention during the finalization of the integration processes.\nWe may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to manage our anticipated growth effectively, our operating costs could increase and our operating margins could decrease.\nWe have grown our infrastructure to build out our offerings as well as to accommodate our acquisitions and expect to continue to grow our infrastructure to ensure that our current and future offerings remain competitive as well as to address other potential additional business combinations. Our growth may place, to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. If we continue to grow our operations, we may not be effective in enlarging our physical facilities, systems, procedures and internal controls may not be adequate to support such expansion. If we are unable to manage our growth, our operating costs could increase and our operating margins could decrease.\nAny downturn in sales to our target markets could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success is highly dependent upon our ability to sell our software solutions to customers in the manufacturing, distribution, services, and travel industries. If we are unable to sell our software solutions effectively to customers in these industries, we may not be able to grow our business. It is uncertain whether our software solutions may achieve and sustain the levels of demand and market acceptance that we anticipate. Such uncertainty is attributable to, among other factors, the following:\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult than we currently anticipate to implement our software solutions in certain verticals within our target industries;\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult than we currently anticipate to increase our customer base in our target industries; and\n\u2022\nour limited experience implementing our software solutions in certain verticals within our target industries.\nOur revenue growth has historically been derived from customers in many major industries. Our revenue growth is highly dependent upon continued growth of market acceptance in these industries, and there can be no assurance our solutions may achieve or sustain widespread acceptance among customers in these industries. Failure to expand market acceptance of our solutions or maintain sales in these industries could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur software solutions require implementation projects that are subject to significant risks and delays, which if any occurred could negatively impact the effectiveness of our software, resulting in harm to our reputation, business and financial performance.\nThe implementation of our software solutions can involve complex, large-scale projects that require substantial support operations, significant resources and reliance on factors that are beyond our control. For example, the success of our implementation projects is heavily dependent upon the quality of data used by our software solutions, the commitment of customers\u2019 resources and personnel to the projects, and the stability, functionality and scalability of the customer\u2019s information technology infrastructure. We may not be able to correct or compensate for weaknesses or problems in infrastructure or data, or any lack of our customers\u2019 commitment and investment in personnel and resources. In addition, implementation of our software solutions can be highly complex and require substantial efforts and cooperation on the part of our customers. If we are unable to successfully manage the implementation of our software solutions such that those products do not meet customer needs or expectations, we may become involved in disputes with our customers and our business, reputation and financial performance may be significantly harmed. For projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize our license and implementation revenues as implementation services are performed. Any delays in an implementation project or changes in the scope or timing of an implementation project would delay or alter the corresponding revenue recognition and could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, any delays or changes in scope could result in estimated project costs exceeding contracted revenue of which a loss reserve would need to be established which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. If an implementation\nproject for a large customer or a number of customers is substantially delayed or canceled, our ability to recognize the associated revenue and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf our executives and other key personnel are unable to effectively manage our business, or if we fail to attract additional qualified sales, marketing, professional services, product development and other personnel, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends upon the performance and service of our executive officers and other key sales, marketing, development, science and professional services staff. The failure of our executives and key personnel to effectively manage our business or the loss of the services of our executive officers and other key personnel would harm our operations. In addition, our future success could depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly qualified sales, marketing, professional services, product development and other personnel, and there can be no assurance that we may be able to do so. We have continued to add a significant number of new personnel to support our continued growth, and their ability to learn our business and manage it effectively could be important to our continued growth and expansion. In addition, given the highly sophisticated data science included in our solutions, the pool of data scientists and software developers qualified to work on our solutions is limited. The implementation of our software solutions requires highly-qualified personnel, and hiring and retaining such personnel to support our growth may be challenging. Competition for such qualified personnel is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that have greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources than we do. If our key personnel are unable to effectively manage our business, or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nDeterioration of general U.S. and global economic conditions could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nWe are a global company with customers around the world. Global financial markets have experienced extreme disruption in recent years, including, among other factors, extreme volatility in security prices, limited ability to raise capital in public and private financial markets, severely diminished liquidity, credit unavailability and company rating downgrades. These conditions have a negative impact on our prospects' and customers' ability to raise capital and operate their businesses.\nThe implementation of our software solutions, which are often accompanied by third-party hardware purchases and other capital commitments, can involve significant capital expenditure by our customers. Customers may reduce or defer their spending on technology. Customers may also elect to purchase our solutions via SaaS or term licenses, which could adversely impact our liquidity and/or result in the deferral of revenue over the contractual service period. In addition, the weak and uncertain U.S. and global economic conditions could impair our customers' ability to pay for our products or services. Any of these factors could delay our revenue recognition or otherwise adversely impact our business overall results and financial condition.\nPeriodic fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar and other currencies, corporate profits, lower spending, the impact of conflicts throughout the world, terrorist acts, natural disasters, volatile energy costs, the outbreak of diseases and other geopolitical factors have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the U.S. and global economies. We are unable to predict the strength, duration or impact of current market conditions.\nA significant or prolonged economic downturn in industries in which we focus may result in our customers or prospects reducing or postponing spending on the solutions we offer.\nThere are a number of factors, other than our performance, that could affect the size, frequency and renewal rates of our customer contracts. For instance, if economic conditions weaken in any industry in which our customers or prospects are focused, our customers or prospects may reduce or postpone their spending significantly which may, in turn, lower the demand for our solutions and negatively affect our revenue and profitability. As a way of dealing with a challenging economic environment, customers may change their purchasing strategies, including, in some instances, requesting term licenses or SaaS agreements as opposed to perpetual license agreements, increased negotiation of price, deciding to license one solution rather than multiple solutions or licensing solutions for portions of their business. Customers could also terminate or delay their implementations or maintenance contracts. Change in license terms or the loss of, or any significant decline in business from, our customers may lead to a significant decline in our revenue and operating margins, particularly if we are unable to make corresponding reductions in our expenses in the event of any such loss or decline. Moreover, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable, liquidity and future operating results.\nWe incurred indebtedness by issuing Senior notes, and our debt repayment obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations in the future.\nIn December 2014, we issued $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes (the \"Senior Notes\") due December 1, 2019, unless earlier purchased or converted. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2015. Our indebtedness could have important consequences because it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, and a portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated towards repaying the principal beginning in 2019 or earlier if necessary.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We cannot control many of these factors. Our future operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to repay our debt. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to pay our indebtedness when due, we may be required to renegotiate the terms of the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nA weakening economy and changing business conditions could result in substantial defaults or slowing of payments by our customers on our accounts receivable which could have a significant negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nA significant portion of our working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers. If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were unable to pay for solutions and services, or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur revenues, and in particular our software license revenues, vary each quarter and are difficult to predict.\nRevenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our licensing activity with new and existing customers, and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter under our revenue recognition policies. A delay or deferral in a small number of new software license transactions could cause our quarterly license revenue to fall significantly short of our expectations.\nThe period over which we recognize license and implementation revenue for each customer depends on a variety of factors, including the number of licensed software solutions and the scope and complexity of the customer\u2019s deployment requirements. As a result, a majority of our revenue is recognized on arrangements that were executed in previous periods. Any shortfall in new sales of our software solutions may not be reflected in our revenue for several quarters, and as such the adverse impact on our business may not be readily apparent.\nFor projects accounted for on a percentage-of-completion method, our revenue recognition is primarily based upon our ability to estimate the efforts required to complete our implementation projects, which may be difficult to estimate.\nTiming of revenue recognition on our contractual arrangements varies based on the nature of the performance obligations in each contract and the associated contract terms. For projects accounted for on a percentage-of-completion method, our ability to estimate the effort required to complete our implementation may be difficult to estimate.\nChanges in accounting principles or standards, or in the way they are applied, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and could adversely affect our reported operating results.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in existing principles, standards or guidance, in particular those related to revenue recognition, can have a significant effect on our reported results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") is currently working with the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") to converge certain accounting principles and to facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow U.S. GAAP and those that are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). These projects may result in different accounting principles under U.S. GAAP, which may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results in areas including, but not limited to, principles for recognizing revenue, lease accounting, and financial statement presentation. In connection with this initiative, the FASB issued a new accounting standard for revenue\nrecognition in May 2014 - Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" - that supersedes nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. Although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, it could change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions. Adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption.\nIn addition, the SEC may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of IFRS into the financial reporting system for U.S. companies. Changes in accounting principles from U.S. GAAP to IFRS, or to converged accounting principles, may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of previously reported transactions.\nFailure to sustain our historical maintenance, support, and subscription renewal rates and pricing would adversely affect our operating results.\nMaintenance, support, and subscription agreements are typically for a term of one to three years. Historically, maintenance and support revenue has represented a significant portion of our total revenue, including approximately 29%, 32% and 34% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Subscription revenue has represented approximately 13%, 6% and 8% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. If our customers choose not to renew their maintenance, support and subscription agreements with us on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe might not generate increased business from our customers, which could limit our revenue in the future.\nWe sell our software solutions to both new customers and existing customers. Many of our existing customers initially purchase our software solutions for a specific business segment or a specific geographic location within their organization and later purchase additional software solutions for the same or other business segments and geographic locations within their organization. These customers might not choose to make additional purchases of our software solutions or to expand their existing software solutions to other business segments. In addition, as we deploy new applications and features for our software solutions or introduce new software solutions, our current customers could choose not to purchase these new offerings. If we fail to generate additional business from our existing customers, our revenue could grow at a slower rate or even decrease.\nIf our cost estimates for fixed-fee arrangements do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of implementing our software solutions, our profitability could be reduced and we could experience losses on these arrangements.\nHistorically, a portion of our implementation arrangements were priced on a fixed-fee basis, and we may price implementation arrangements on a fixed-fee basis in the future. If we underestimate the amount of effort required to implement our software solutions under these fixed-fee arrangements, our profitability could be reduced. Moreover, if the actual costs of completing the implementation exceed the agreed upon fixed price, we could incur a loss on the arrangement.\nIf we fail to develop or acquire new functionality to enhance our existing software solutions, we may not be able to grow our business and it could be harmed.\nThe sales, pricing and revenue management software market is characterized by:\n\u2022\nrapid technological developments;\n\u2022\nnewly emerging and changing customer requirements; and\n\u2022\nfrequent solution introductions, updates and functional enhancements.\nWe must introduce enhancements to our existing software solutions in order to meet our business plan, maintain or improve our competitive position, keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing customer requirements and increase awareness of big data software for sales, pricing and revenue management generally and of our software solutions in particular. Any new functionality we develop may not be introduced in a timely manner and may not achieve market acceptance sufficient to generate material revenue. Furthermore, we believe that our competitors are heavily investing in research and development, and may develop and market new solutions that may compete with, and may reduce the demand for, our software solutions. We cannot provide assurance that we could be successful in developing or otherwise acquiring, marketing and licensing new functionality, or delivering updates and upgrades that meet changing industry standards and customer demands. In addition, we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, marketing and licensing of such functionality. If we are unable to develop or acquire new functionality, enhance our existing software solutions or adapt to changing industry requirements to meet market demand, we may not be able to grow our business and our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, because our software solutions are intended to operate on a variety of technology platforms, we must continue to modify and enhance our software solutions to keep pace with changes in these platforms, as well as develop and maintain relationships with platform providers. Any inability of our software solutions to operate effectively with existing or future platforms, or our inability to develop or maintain relationships with significant platform providers, could reduce the demand for our software solutions, result in customer dissatisfaction and limit our revenue.\nOur big data software solutions require hardware to operate which may be difficult for our customers to obtain.\nThe implementation of our big data software solutions often requires specific hardware to operate. The inability of our customers\u2019 to access and secure such hardware could impact the effectiveness of our software and result in harm to our reputation if the software does not operate properly due to the unavailability of the necessary hardware. If businesses do not implement our software due to their inability to obtain the hardware needed for our software, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nDefects or errors in our software solutions could harm our reputation, impair our ability to sell our solutions and result in significant costs to us.\nOur software solutions are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors. Several of our solutions have recently been developed and may therefore be more likely to contain undetected defects or errors. In addition, we frequently develop enhancements to our software solutions that may contain defects. We have not suffered significant harm from any defects or errors to date. We have in the past issued, and may in the future need to issue, corrective releases of our solutions to correct defects or errors, but we may not be able to detect and correct any such defects or errors before the final implementation of our software solutions. The occurrence of any defects or errors could result in:\n\u2022\ndelayed market acceptance and lost sales of our software solutions;\n\u2022\ndelays in payment to us by customers;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our resources;\n\u2022\nlegal claims, including product liability claims, against us;\n\u2022\nincreased maintenance and support expenses; and\n\u2022\nincreased insurance costs.\nOur license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our liability for defects and errors in our software solutions and damages relating to such defects and errors, but these provisions may not be enforced by a court or otherwise effectively protect us from legal claims. Our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover all of the costs resulting from these legal claims. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that our current liability insurance coverage would continue to be available on acceptable terms. In addition, the insurer may deny coverage on any future claims. The successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, even if we prevail in any litigation, we are likely to incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our operations.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims may cause us to incur significant expense or prevent us from selling our software solutions.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. A third-party may assert that our technology violates its intellectual property rights, or we may become the subject of a material intellectual property dispute. Sales, pricing and revenue management solutions may become increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of commercially available sales, pricing and revenue management solutions increases and the functionality of these solutions overlaps. In addition, changes in patent laws in the U.S. may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought by us related to our patent rights. Future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own potential patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. Regardless of the merit of any particular claim that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of others, responding to such claims may require us to:\n\u2022\nincur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts to defend such claims;\n\u2022\npay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed such parties\u2019 patents or copyrights;\n\u2022\ncease making, licensing or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others;\n\u2022\ndistract management and other key personnel from performing their duties for us;\n\u2022\nenter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies; and\n\u2022\nexpend additional development resources to redesign our solutions.\nAny licenses required as a result of litigation under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively develop or market our solutions, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or maintain profitability.\nContract terms generally obligate us to indemnify our customers for their use of the intellectual property associated with our software or for other third-party products that are incorporated into our solutions and that infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If we are unable to resolve our legal obligations by settling or paying an infringement claim or a related indemnification claim as described above, we may be required to compensate our customers under the contractual arrangement with such customers. Some of our intellectual property indemnification obligations are contractually capped at a very high amount or not capped at all.\nIf we fail to protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property adequately, our business and prospects may be harmed.\nOur success could depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot, however, be certain that steps we take to protect our proprietary rights could prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, or the development and marketing of similar and competing products and services by third parties.\nWe rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. Trade secrets, however, are difficult to protect. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, and in such cases, we could not assert such trade secret rights against such parties. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, scientific advisor's and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nThe patent position of technology-oriented companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the United States Patent and Trademark Office use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims allowed in any patents that may be issued to us or to others. Our patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products, or provide us with any competitive advantage. Moreover, our patents and any patent for which we have licensed or may license rights may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. If our patents are invalidated or otherwise limited, other companies may be better able to develop products that compete with ours, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition.\nAny patent application we submit may not result in an issued patent. Patent applications in the U.S. are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all, and publications of discoveries in industry-related literature lag behind actual discoveries. We cannot be certain that we were the first to invent the technologies claimed in any pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection.\nIn addition, despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The issuance of a patent does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable. As such, even\nif we obtain patents, they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties. In addition, the issuance of a patent does not guarantee that we have a right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing or practicing our potentially patented products. As a result, we may be required to obtain licenses under these third-party patents. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to make and sell our software solutions and competitors would be more easily able to compete with us.\nWe use open source software in our solutions that may subject our software solutions to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions, which may cause harm to our business.\nWe use open source software in our solutions and may use more open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software solutions with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensor's generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. In addition, open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our software, to re-engineer our solutions, to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe utilize third-party software that we incorporate into our software solutions, and impaired relations with these third parties, defects in third-party software or a third party\u2019s inability or failure to enhance their software over time could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition.\nWe incorporate and include third-party software into our software solutions. If our relations with any of these third parties are impaired, or if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software, our business could be harmed. The operation of our solutions could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize. It may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software because the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software. There can be no assurance that these third parties may continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software.\nOur international sales, and the growth of our international operations, subject us to risks that may adversely affect our operating results.\nInternational operations are subject to risks associated with operating outside of the United States. We may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 56%, 55% and 56% of our total revenue, respectively, was derived from outside the United States. We have customers in over 55 countries, and have operations in the United Kingdom, France and Germany (through wholly-owned subsidiaries). The financial impact of our international operations to our overall business has been insignificant to date. We expect our international operations to grow as the result of acquiring Cameleon in 2014. Managing overseas growth could require significant resources and management attention and may subject us to new or larger levels of regulatory, economic, foreign currency exchange, tax and political risks. Among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us with respect to our international sales and operations are:\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in various parts of the world;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nless protection for intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\ncosts of compliance and penalties for noncompliance with foreign laws and laws applicable to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing tax laws and regulations that may affect both our international and domestic tax liabilities and result in increased complexity and costs;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of managing and staffing our international operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, especially in developing countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in exchange rates; and\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers, import and export controls and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our solutions in certain foreign markets.\nIf we continue to expand our business globally, our success could depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition. To date, the majority of our sales have been denominated in U.S. dollars, although the majority of our expenses that we incur in our international operations are denominated in local currencies. To date, we have not used risk management techniques or \"hedged\" the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue and operating margins, are subject to losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur cloud and other new offerings bring new business and operational risks.\nWe have introduced new products and technology initiatives in the area of cloud computing. We include in this category our SaaS offerings. Our SaaS offerings provide our customers with existing and new software management through a hosted service as opposed to traditional software deployments. There can be no assurance that SaaS revenue may be significant in the future despite our investment. There is a risk that our SaaS offerings may reduce demand for licenses and maintenance of our traditional software products which could impact our financial performance in any given quarter. There is also a risk that our internal development and customer support teams could find it difficult or costly to support both traditional software installed by customers and software delivered as a service. In addition, interruptions or delays in service from our third-party service delivery hosts could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. In the cloud, our products may be dependent upon third-party hardware, software and cloud hosting vendors, all of which must inter-operate for end users to achieve their computing goals. Additionally, operating margins on our new initiatives may be lower than those we have achieved in our more mature product markets, and our new initiatives may not generate sufficient revenue to recoup our investments in them. If any of these events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nOur headquarters are located in Houston, Texas, from which we base our operations. We also conduct business in other domestic and international locations. Although we have contingency plans in effect for natural disasters or other catastrophic events (including terrorist attacks and hurricanes), these events could disrupt our operations. Even though we carry business interruption insurance and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events, we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. Even a temporary disruption to our business operations may create a negative perception in the marketplace. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us could have a significant negative impact on our operations.\nThe expiration of the research and experimentation tax credit could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nOur federal effective tax rate historically has been lower than the statutory rate of 34% largely due to tax credit incentives under the U.S. research and experimentation tax credit extended to taxpayers engaged in qualified research and experimental activities. This tax credit is designed to stimulate qualifying company research and development over time by reducing after-tax costs. By qualifying for the tax credit, we have been able to use general business tax credits to reduce our federal income tax liability. Since its enactment in 1981, Congress has reinstated on a retroactive basis the research and experimentation tax credit several times. Cancellation of this research and experimentation tax credit could record federal income taxes at the enacted federal rate of 34%, without the benefit of this tax credit.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley\") and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), and rules currently proposed or subsequently implemented by the SEC and NYSE impose heightened requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. We may also need to\nhire additional personnel to support our compliance requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial costs and make some activities more time-consuming.\nIf we fail to continue to maintain internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our market price may be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to provide a report by our registered independent public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to continue to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if a material weakness is identified in our internal controls over financial reporting, or if we are unable to implement internal controls over financial reporting for our acquisitions, our financial results may be adversely affected and we could lose investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. Accordingly failure to maintain effective controls over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks relating to ownership of our common stock and the Senior Notes:\nMarket volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.\nThe market price for our common stock, and the software industry generally, has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Volatility could make it difficult to trade shares of our common stock at predictable prices or times.\nMany factors could cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile, including the following:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\ndecreases in market valuations of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022\ndecreases in financial estimates by equity research analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of significant contracts, new solutions or enhancements, acquisitions, distribution partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ndeparture of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations and standards affecting the software industry and our software solutions;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock or other securities by us in the future;\n\u2022\ndamages, settlements, legal fees and other costs related to litigation, claims and other contingencies;\n\u2022\ndeterioration of the general U.S. and global economic condition; and\n\u2022\nother risks described elsewhere in this section.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation often has been initiated against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of the company\u2019s securities. If class action litigation is initiated against us, we may incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our operations. All of these factors could cause the market price of our stock to decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nShares of our common stock are relatively illiquid and trading of our shares could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is thinly traded, and we have a relatively small public float. Our common stock may be less liquid than the stock of companies with a broader public ownership. In addition, sales of a large volume of our common stock by us or our current or future stockholders, or the perception that sales could occur, may also have a significant impact on its trading price.\nIf equity research analysts cease to publish research or reports about us or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis, one class each year;\n\u2022\na prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\na requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\na requirement that a supermajority vote be obtained to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital, repayment of debt and for other general corporate purposes. Any payment of future dividends would be at the discretion of our board of directors and would depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Senior Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Senior Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Senior Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Senior Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Senior Notes to their face amount over the term of the Senior Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period's amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Senior Notes. In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Senior Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that any shares issuable upon conversion of the Senior Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Senior Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nOur directors, executive officers, and certain significant stockholders hold a significant portion of our outstanding shares.\nOur directors and executive officers collectively control approximately 17% of our issued and outstanding common shares, and together with certain significant stockholders, including investment funds associated with Brown Capital Management, LLC, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Champlain Investment Partners, LLC, control approximately 44% of our issued and outstanding common shares. As a result, these stockholders could influence matters requiring stockholder approval in ways that may not align with your interest as a stockholder, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us even if such change of control would be beneficial to you as a stockholder, and could affect the market price of our shares if there is a sale by this group of stockholders.", "PERMNO": 92143, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PRO"}
