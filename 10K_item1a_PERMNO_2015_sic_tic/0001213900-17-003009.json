{"cik": "811641", "company": "IMMUCELL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nProjection of net income: Generally speaking, our financial performance can differ significantly from management projections, due to numerous factors that are difficult to predict or that are beyond our control. Weaker than expected sales of First Defense\u00ae or extended shortfalls in production relative to the growing product sales demand could lead to less profits or an operating loss. Large investments in product development (or cost overruns) can result in a net loss. We have been profitable since the second half of 2014 and expect this trend to continue.\nReliance on sales of First Defense\u00ae: We are heavily reliant on the market acceptance of First Defense\u00ae to generate product sales and fund our operations (including part of the construction and equipment costs of our Nisin production plant to support the commercialization of Mast Out\u00ae). Our business would not have been profitable during the nine consecutive years in the period ended December 31, 2007, or during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016 without the gross margin that we earned on sales of First Defense\u00ae, which accounted for 93% of our product sales during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nProduct risks generally: The sale of our products is subject to financial, efficacy, regulatory, competitive and other market risks. Elevated standards to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance required to sell our products continue to evolve. There is no assurance that we will continue to achieve market acceptance at a profitable price level or that we can continue to manufacture our products at a low enough cost to result in a sufficient gross margin to justify their continued manufacture and sale.\nProduct liability: The manufacture and sale of our products entails a risk of product liability. Our exposure to product liability is mitigated to some extent by the fact that our products are principally directed towards the animal health market. We have maintained product liability insurance in an amount which we believe is reasonable in relation to our potential exposure in this area. We have no history of claims of this nature being made.\nRegulatory requirements for First Defense\u00ae: First Defense\u00ae is sold in the United States subject to a product license from the Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA, which was first obtained in 1991. The potency of serial lots is directly traceable to the original serial used to obtain the product performance claims (the \u201cReference Standard\u201d). Due to the unique nature of the First Defense\u00ae label claims, host animal re-testing is not required as long as periodic laboratory analyses continue to support the stability of stored Reference Standard. To date, these analyses have demonstrated strong stability. However, if the USDA were not to approve requalification of the Reference Standard, additional clinical studies could be required to meet regulatory requirements and allow for continued sales of the product. We expect to be subject to similar regulatory risks for our anticipated rotavirus claim, and similar regulatory oversight risks exist in territories outside of the United States where we sell our products.\nImmuCell Corporation\nRegulatory requirements for Wipe Out\u00aeDairy Wipes: While the FDA regulates the manufacture and sale of Wipe Out\u00aeDairy Wipes, this type of product is permitted to be sold without NADA approval, in accordance with the FDA\u2019s Compliance Policy Guide 7125.30 (\u201cTeat Dips and Udder Washes for Dairy Cows and Goats\u201d). The manufacture of Wipe Out\u00aeDairy Wipes is subject to Part 211 of the cGMP regulations. As a result, our operations are subject to inspection by the FDA. During the second quarter of 2007, the FDA inspected our facilities and operations and issued a Warning Letter to us, citing deficiencies in specific areas of the cGMP regulations. We filed an initial response to the FDA during the second quarter of 2007, and we responded to a request for additional information during the second quarter of 2008. During the first quarter of 2013, the FDA again inspected our facilities and operations. The report from this inspection was favorable, and we responded to the few, minor observations that were noted. During the third quarter of 2016, the FDA inspected our facilities and operations again. The report from this inspection noted five observations. We submitted our responses to the observations that were noted, and subsequently were informed that the FDA had closed its inspection. During the first quarter of 2017, we discontinued the manufacture and sale of this product, which reduces our exposure to an adverse action by the FDA in this respect to a minimal level.\nRegulatory requirements for Mast Out\u00ae: The commercial introduction of Mast Out\u00ae in the United States will require us to obtain FDA approval for this product. Completing the development of Mast Out\u00ae through to the submission of the administrative NADA to the FDA involves risk. While three Technical Sections have been approved and the Human Food Safety Technical Section is near completion, the development process timeline has been extensive (17 years) and has involved multiple commercial production strategies. As such, the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Technical Section has not yet been submitted for the Nisin Drug Substance or the Drug Product. To reduce the risk associated with this process, we have met with the FDA on multiple occasions to align on filing strategy and requirements. We have disclosed a timeline of events that could lead to approval during 2019. We are exposed to additional regulatory compliance risks through the subcontractors that we choose to work with to produce Mast Out\u00ae, who also need to satisfy certain regulatory requirements in order to provide us with the products and services we need. International regulatory approvals would be required for sales outside of the United States, such as Canada. European regulatory authorities are not expected to approve a product with a zero milk discard claim, which would remove a significant competitive advantage of Mast Out\u00ae in that territory. However, the assigned milk discard period may be shorter for Mast Out\u00ae than it is for other products on the market in Europe.\nConcentration of sales: Approximately 99% and 97% of our product sales were made to customers in the dairy and beef industries throughout the world during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Approximately 85% and 83% of our product sales were made to customers in the U.S. dairy and beef industries during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A large portion of our product sales (60% and 62% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively) was made to two large distributors. A large portion of our trade accounts receivable (64% and 52% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively) was due from these two distributors. We have a good history with these distributors, but the concentration of sales and accounts receivable with a small number of customers does present a risk to us, including risks related to such customers experiencing financial difficulties or altering the basis on which they do business with us.\nEconomics of the dairy and beef industries:\n\u25cf The January count of all cattle and calves in the United States had steadily declined from 97,000,000 as of January 1, 2007 to 88,500,000 as of January 1, 2014. Then this figure increased to 89,100,000 as of January 1, 2015 and to 91,900,000 as of January 1, 2016. The U.S. cattle inventory as of January 1, 2017 totaled 93,600,000, which is 1.8% higher than January 1, 2016\n\u25cf From 1998 through 2016, the size (annual average) of the U.S. dairy herd ranged from approximately the low of 9,011,000 (2004) to the high of 9,332,000 (2016). The 2016 level exceeded the previous high during this nineteen-year period of 9,317,000 in 2015.\nImmuCell Corporation\n\u25cf While the number of cows in the U.S. herd and the production of milk per cow directly influence the supply of milk, demand for milk is also influenced by very volatile international demand for milk products. The Class III milk price (an industry benchmark that reflects the value of product used to make cheese) is an important indicator because it defines our customers\u2019 revenue level. This annual average milk price level (measured in dollars per hundred pounds of milk) for 2014 of $22.34 (peaking at $24.60 in September 2014) was the highest level since these prices were first reported in 1980. This strong price level declined to the average of $15.80 during 2015 and further declined to $14.87 during 2016. However, the average during the three-month period ended January 31, 2017 was $16.98. The recent annual fluctuations in this milk price level are demonstrated in the following table:\n\u25cf The actual level of milk prices may be less important than its level relative to feed costs. One measure of this relationship is known as the milk-to-feed price ratio, which represents the amount of feed that one pound of milk can buy. The annual average for this ratio of 1.52 in 2012 was the lowest recorded since this ratio was first reported in 1985. The highest annual average this ratio has reached since 1985 was 3.64 in 1987. Since this ratio reached 3.24 in 2005, it has not exceeded 3.0. The annual average of 2.54 for 2014 was the highest this ratio has been since it was 2.81 in 2007. This ratio dropped to an annual average of 2.12 during 2015 and increased to 2.24 during 2016. The following table demonstrates the annual volatility and the low values of this ratio recently:\n\u25cf An increase in feed costs also has a negative impact on the beef industry. Widespread severe drought conditions in key U.S. agricultural regions during 2012 drove feed costs higher and the inventory of all cattle and calves lower. The positive trend in these market indices during 2013 and 2014 resulted in an increase in the value of milk cows. The 2014 annual average price for a milk cow increased by 32% to $1,835 in comparison to 2013. Previously, this annual average price since 1970 was only higher when it reached $1,840 in 2007 and $1,953 in 2008. This annual average price for 2015 increased by 9% to $1,993 in comparison to 2014, but this average price has declined by 11% to $1,768 during 2016. The industry data referred to above is compiled from USDA databases. The value of newborn bull calves had risen to the unusually high level of approximately $300 to $400 during 2015 but has declined to very little presently, depending on region. Given our focus on the dairy and beef industries, the volatile market conditions and the resulting financial insecurities of our primary end users are risks to our ability to maintain and grow sales at a profitable level. These factors also heighten the challenge of selling premium-priced animal health products (such as Mast Out\u00ae) into the dairy market.\nImmuCell Corporation\nProduct development risks: The development of new products is subject to financial, scientific, regulatory, and market risks. Our current business growth strategy relies heavily on the development of Mast Out\u00ae, which requires (and will continue to require) a substantial investment. Our efforts will be subject to inspection and approval by the FDA. There is no assurance whether or when we will obtain all of the data necessary to support regulatory approval for this product.\nRisks associated with Mast Out\u00ae funding strategy: The construction of and the financing for the commercial-scale Nisin production plant is the most critical action in front of us on our path to U.S. regulatory approval for Mast Out\u00ae. We believe our current cash and investments, together with the available debt facility of up to approximately $6.5 million and cash to be generated from operations, will be adequate financing to complete the project. However, due to the risks described herein, we could fail to generate sufficient cash to fully fund that project, and we could experience cost overruns or delays. We will not know whether we will receive the necessary regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell Mast Out\u00ae, or whether the product will achieve market acceptance and profitability, until after we have completed construction of the production facility described elsewhere in this report, at the presently estimated cost of $20 million. Absent sufficient sales of this new product at a profitable gross margin, we would be required to fund all debt service costs from sales of First Defense\u00ae which would reduce our expected profitability going forward.\nUncertainty of market size and product sales estimates: Estimating the size of the market for Mast Out\u00ae is subject to numerous uncertainties. Some of the uncertainties surrounding our product include market acceptance, the development of the subclinical mastitis treatment market, the effect of a premium selling price on market penetration, competition from existing products sold by substantially larger competitors, cost of manufacture and integration of milk from treated cows with susceptible cheese starter cultures.\nCompetition from others: Many of our competitors are significantly larger and more diversified in the relevant markets than we are and have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development capabilities than we do, including greater ability to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and declining revenues and/or profitability. Zoetis, Elanco, Boehringer Ingelheim and Merck, among other companies, sell products that compete directly with First Defense\u00ae in preventing scours in newborn calves. The product sold by Elanco (which has a similar selling price to our product) experienced a lack of supply in the market during late 2014 and into the middle of 2015 but returned to the market in the latter part of 2015 and has regained a significant portion of the market share it had lost during this period. The product sold by Zoetis does carry a rotavirus claim (which we do not yet have), but it does not have an E. coli claim (which we do have), and it sells for approximately half the price of our product. The market for the treatment of mastitis in dairy cows is highly competitive, and presently is dominated by large companies such as Zoetis, Merck and Boehringer Ingelheim. There is no assurance that Mast Out\u00aewill compete successfully in this market. We may not be aware of other companies that compete with us or intend to compete with us in the future.\nAccess to raw materials: Our policy is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used to manufacture and test our products that we obtain from third parties. However, there is a risk that we could have difficulty in efficiently acquiring essential supplies. The loss of farms from which we buy raw material for First Defense\u00ae could make it difficult for us to produce enough inventory. We are dependent on our manufacturing facility and operations in Portland, Maine for the production of First Defense\u00ae and will be dependent on the facility we are constructing in Portland for the production of Mast Out\u00ae when that product begins commercial sales. The specific antibodies that we purify from colostrum for First Defense\u00ae are not readily available from other sources. We are dependent on Nordson Corporation (formerly Plas-Pak Inc.) for the supply of the syringes used for our gel tube format of First Defense Technology\u00ae and expect to be dependent on this company for the supply of the syringes for Mast Out\u00ae. The supply contract covering the Mast Out\u00ae syringes would need to be extended past December 31, 2020 unless an alternative supplier is identified. We expect to be dependent on Norbrook for the sterile-filling and final packaging of our Drug Substance into Drug Product. We are evaluating alternative sources for these services for potential use post-approval. Given the requirement that such a facility be inspected and approved by the FDA, it could be costly and time-consuming to find and qualify an adequate alternative source for these services. Any significant damage to or other disruption in the services at any of these third party or company-owned facilities (including due to regulatory non-compliance) could adversely affect the production of inventory and result in significant added expenses and loss of future sales.\nImmuCell Corporation\nSmall size; dependence on key personnel: We are a small company with 45 employees (including 6 part-time employees). As such, we rely on certain key employees to support different operational functions, with limited redundancy in capacity. The loss of any of these key employees could adversely affect our operations until a qualified replacement is hired and trained. Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract and retain key scientific, manufacturing, managerial and sales and marketing personnel, to develop proprietary technologies and products, to obtain USDA or FDA approval for new products, to maintain regulatory compliance with current products and to continue to profitably sell our current products. We currently compete on the basis of product performance, price and distribution capability. We continue to monitor our network of independent distributors to maintain our competitive position.\nFailure to protect intellectual property: In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain products or processes. Instead, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant proprietary technology through operational safeguards and contractual agreements. Reliance upon trade secret, rather than patent, protection may cause us to be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate our manufacturing techniques and processes. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or technology or obtain access to our unpatented trade secrets or proprietary technology. Other companies may have filed patent applications and may have been issued patents involving products or technologies potentially useful to us or necessary for us to commercialize our products or achieve our business goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to such patents on terms that are acceptable. There is also a risk that competitors could challenge the claims in patents that have been issued to us.\nCertain provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management: Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our Common Stock Rights Plan or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf limitations on the removal of directors; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to refuse to redeem rights issued under our Common Stock Rights Plan or otherwise to limit or suspend its operation that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and\n\u25cf Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally defined as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could depress the trading price of our common stock or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood of obtaining a premium for our common stock in an acquisition.\nCost burdens of our reporting obligations as a public company: Operating a public company involves substantial costs to comply with reporting obligations under federal securities laws and the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nExposure to risks associated with the financial downturn and global economic crisis: The U.S. economy has come out of a recession, which was caused principally by the housing, credit and financial crises that began around 2008. However, such recent positive indications could prove temporary and further downturn could occur. The credit markets continue to be very turbulent and uncertain. Some observers believe that the housing market remains problematic for the overall U.S. economy, the United States has taken on too much national debt and the equity markets are overvalued. Interest rates are trending higher, and a significant portion of our bank debt currently bears interest at variable rates. This extraordinary period of instability in the U.S. economy and the financial markets has been troubling for nearly all Americans. The European economy remains sluggish and precarious. Certain emerging markets also show signs of slower growth or, in some areas, downturns in economic performance. While we do price our products in U.S. dollars for all export markets, the strength of the dollar against weakening foreign currencies could reduce product demand in international markets. A combination of the conditions, trends and concerns summarized above could have a corresponding negative effect on our business and operations, including the demand for our products in the U.S. market and our ability to penetrate international markets.\nBovine diseases: The potential for epidemics of bovine diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease, Bovine Tuberculosis, Brucellosis and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) presents a risk to us and our customers. Documented cases of BSE in the United States have led to an overall tightening of regulations pertaining to ingredients of animal origin, especially bovine. First Defense\u00ae is considered a veterinary medicine rather than a feed ingredient, and it is manufactured from bovine milk (colostrum), which is not considered a BSE risk material. Future regulatory action to increase protection of the human food supply could affect First Defense\u00ae, although presently we do not anticipate that this will be the case.\nImmuCell Corporation\nBiological terrorism: The threat of biological terrorism is a risk to both the economic health of our customers and our ability to economically acquire and collect good quality raw material from our contract farms. Any act of widespread bioterrorism against the dairy industry could adversely affect our operations.\nStock market valuation: Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Stock Market (NasdaqCM: ICCC). Our average daily trading volume (although it has increased recently) is lower than the volume for most other companies and the bid/ask stock price spread can be larger, which could result in investors facing difficulty selling their stock for proceeds that they may expect or desire. There are companies in the animal health sector with market capitalization values that greatly exceed our current market capitalization of approximately $27,000,000 as of March 20, 2017. Some of these companies have little or no product sales. We currently have annual product sales of almost $10,000,000. Before gross margin from the sale of new products is achieved, our market capitalization may be heavily dependent on the perceived potential for growth from our products under development.\nNo expectation to pay any dividends or repurchase stock for the foreseeable future: We do not anticipate paying any dividends to, or repurchasing stock from, our stockholders for the foreseeable future. Instead, we expect to use cash to fund product development costs and investments in our facility and production equipment and to reduce debt. Stockholders must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable laws, current and anticipated needs for liquidity and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 11292, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ICCC"}
