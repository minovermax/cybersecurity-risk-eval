A sustained period of deterioration of oil prices is likely to adversely affect our future financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nOil prices have historically been volatile, with NYMEX oil prices ranging from $26 to $107 per Bbl over the last three calendar years, with prices in February 2016 representing the lowest level in over 14 years. Even if oil prices recover for a period of time, volatility will remain, and prices could move downward or upward on a rapid or repeated basis, which can make transactions, valuations and business strategies difficult. Our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil, as oil comprised approximately 96% of our 2016 production and approximately 97% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2016. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include the supply of, and demand for, these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of worldwide consumer demand for oil and natural gas and the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas and levels of domestic oil and gas storage;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which domestic oil and natural gas production affects worldwide supply of crude oil or its price;\n\u2022\nworldwide political events, conditions and policies, including actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations; and\n\u2022\nworldwide economic conditions.\nDue to the sustained period of low oil prices, the PV-10 Value of our estimated proved reserves was less than our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2016. If oil prices decline further for an extended period of time, we could be harmed in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022lower cash flows from operations may require continued or further reduced levels of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nreduced levels of capital expenditures in turn could lower our present and future production levels, and lower the quantities and value of our oil and gas reserves, which constitute our major asset;\n\u2022\nour lenders could reduce our borrowing base, and we may not be able to raise capital at attractive rates in the public markets;\n\u2022\nwe could be forced to increase our level of indebtedness, issue additional equity, or sell assets;\n\u2022\nwe could have difficulty repaying or refinancing our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe could be required to impair various assets, including a further write-down of our oil and natural gas assets or the value of other tangible or intangible assets;\n\u2022\nconstruction of plants that produce CO2 as a byproduct that we can purchase could be delayed or cancelled, thus limiting the amount of industrial-source CO2 available for use in our tertiary operations; and/or\n\u2022\nour potential cash flows from our commodity derivative contracts that include sold puts could be limited to the extent that oil prices are below the prices of those sold puts.\nFurthermore, some or all of our tertiary projects could remain or become uneconomical. We may also decide to suspend future expansion projects, and if prices were to drop below our operating cash break-even points for an extended period of time, we may further decide to shut-in existing production, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reduce our production.\nA financial downturn in one or more of the world\u2019s major markets could negatively affect our liquidity, business and financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Our liquidity could be substantially negatively affected by an inability to obtain capital in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or equity capital markets or an inability to access bank financing. A sustained credit crisis, further drops in economic growth rates in China, regional or worldwide increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions, significant international currency fluctuations, a severe economic contraction either regionally or worldwide or turmoil in the global financial system, could materially affect our liquidity, business and financial condition. In the past, conditions such as these have adversely impacted financial markets and have created substantial volatility and uncertainty with the related negative impact on global economic activity. Negative credit market conditions could inhibit our lenders from fully funding our bank credit facility\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nor cause them to make the terms of our bank credit facility more costly and more restrictive. Negative economic conditions could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables or performance by our suppliers or cause our commodity hedging arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or otherwise seek bankruptcy protection.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect the level of our production activities if not materially reduced.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our outstanding indebtedness consisted of $614.9 million principal amount of 9% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021, $1.6 billion principal amount of subordinated notes, virtually all of which have maturity dates between 2021 and 2023 at interest rates ranging from 4.625% to 6.375% per annum at a weighted average interest rate of 5.28% per annum, and $301.0 million principal amount outstanding under our bank credit facility. As of February 22, 2017, we have a borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments of $1.05 billion under our bank credit facility and availability with respect to such commitments of $674.7 million. Our bank borrowing base is adjusted semiannually in May and November of each year, and upon requested unscheduled special redeterminations, in each case at the banks\u2019 discretion, and the amount is established and based, in part, upon certain external factors, such as commodity prices. We do not know, nor can we control, the results of such redeterminations or the effect of then-current oil and natural gas prices on any such redetermination. A future redetermination lowering our borrowing base could limit availability under our bank credit facility. If the outstanding debt under our bank credit facility were to ever exceed the borrowing base, we would be required to repay the excess amount over a period not to exceed six months.\nThe level of our indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nimpairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development activities or general corporate and other purposes;\n\u2022\npotentially restricting us from making acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nreducing our available cash flow if market interest rates increase or if the level of our indebtedness significantly increases;\n\u2022\nrequiring dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to servicing our indebtedness (so that such cash flows would not be available for capital expenditures or other purposes);\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends, fund share repurchases and make certain investments; and/or\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nAdditionally, rising interest rates would, among other things, affect our interest costs under our bank credit facility, increase the cost of any new debt financings, or limit our ability to otherwise borrow additional funds on favorable terms.\nThe debt covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness may also affect our flexibility in reacting to changes in the economy and in our industry. For example, as our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas, our leverage metrics deteriorated during 2015 and 2016. Between May 2015 and April 2016, we modified certain of our financial performance covenants under our senior secured bank credit facility applicable to the 2016, 2017 and 2018 periods to support continuing compliance with these covenants in this low oil price environment. If oil and natural gas prices remain at current levels for an extended period of time, these metrics could deteriorate further, potentially causing us to not be in compliance with our bank credit facility\u2019s covenants. In the future, we may be required to seek further modifications of these covenants, or to further reduce our debt by, among other things, purchasing our subordinated debt in the open market, completing cash tenders for our debt or public or privately negotiated debt exchanges, issuing equity or completing asset sales and other cash-generating activities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to successfully modify these covenants or reduce our debt in the future. For more information on our bank credit facility, see Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Senior Secured Bank Credit Facility.\nAny failure to meet our debt obligations or comply with the debt covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect our cash flows to vary significantly from year to year due to the cyclical nature of our business. A sustained period of low oil prices or their further deterioration may cause us to be unable to make required payments on our indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants governing such indebtedness, especially those in our bank credit\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nfacility, we could be in default under such indebtedness. Any such default, if not cured or waived, could permit the holders of such indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause defaults under other indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments will depend, in part, upon our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors, including factors beyond our control.\nA cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology, among other things, to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves; process and record financial and operating data; analyze seismic and drilling information; process wire transfers and store our banking information; monitor and control pipeline and plant equipment; process and store personally identifiable information of our employees and royalty owners; and communicate with employees, stakeholders and business associates. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations and/or financial loss. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations.\nAlthough we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing and causing us to suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our procedures and controls or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities.\nOil and natural gas development and producing operations involve various risks.\nOur operations are subject to all the risks normally incident and inherent to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including, without limitation, well blowouts; cratering and explosions; pipe failure; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids; release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks. In addition, our operations are sometimes near populated commercial or residential areas, which add additional risks. The nature of these risks is such that some liabilities could exceed our insurance policy limits or otherwise be excluded from, or limited by, our insurance coverage, as in the case of environmental fines and penalties, for example, which are excluded from coverage as they cannot be insured.\nWe could incur significant costs related to these risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If these costs were to increase significantly, it could have an adverse effect upon the profitability of these operations. Additionally, a portion of our production activities involves CO2 injections into fields with wells plugged and abandoned by prior operators. However, it is often difficult (or impracticable) to determine whether a well has been properly plugged prior to commencing injections and pressuring the oil reservoirs. We may incur significant costs in connection with remedial plugging operations to prevent environmental contamination and to otherwise comply with federal, state and local regulations relative to the plugging and abandoning of our oil, natural gas and CO2 wells. In addition to the increased costs, if wells have not been properly plugged, modification to those wells may delay our operations and reduce our production.\nDevelopment activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\nDenbury Resources Inc.\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, and winter conditions and forest fires in the Rocky Mountain region that can delay or impede operations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment, pipelines and services.\nEstimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty.\nEstimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors such as future commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental rules and regulations. There are numerous uncertainties about when a property may have proved reserves as compared to potential or probable reserves, particularly relating to our tertiary recovery operations. Forecasting the amount of oil reserves recoverable from tertiary operations, and the production rates anticipated therefrom, requires estimates, one of the most significant being the oil recovery factor. Actual results most likely will vary from our estimates. Also, the use of a 10% discount factor for reporting purposes, as prescribed by the SEC, may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which our business, and the oil and natural gas industry in general, are subject. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions, or changes of conditions, could result in a revision of the quantities and net present value of our reserves.\nThe reserves data included in documents incorporated by reference represent estimates only. Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions, including first-day-of-the-month average oil and natural gas prices for the 12-month period preceding the date of the assessment. The representative oil and natural gas prices used in estimating our December 31, 2016 reserves were $42.75 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.55 per MMBtu for natural gas, both of which were adjusted for market differentials by field. Rapid crude oil price declines beginning in late 2014 have resulted in a significant decrease in our proved reserve value, and to a lesser degree, a reduction in our proved reserve volumes, which has caused us to record write-downs due to the full cost ceiling test in 2015 and 2016. As discussed in greater detail below, further declines in oil prices could result in additional write-downs. Our reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon changes in economic conditions, including oil and natural gas prices, as well as due to production results, results of future development, operating and development costs, and other factors. Downward revisions of our reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in our estimates.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 18% of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and may require successful drilling operations. The reserves data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, but these assumptions may not be accurate, and these expenditures and operations may not occur.\nOur planned tertiary operations and the related construction of necessary CO2 pipelines could be delayed by difficulties in obtaining pipeline rights-of-way and/or permits, and/or by the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered.\nThe production of crude oil from our planned tertiary operations is dependent upon having access to pipelines to transport available CO2 to our oil fields at a cost that is economically viable. Our current and future construction of CO2 pipelines will require us to obtain rights-of-way from private landowners, state and local governments and the federal government in certain areas. Certain states where we operate have considered or may again consider the adoption of laws or regulations that could limit or eliminate the ability of a pipeline owner or of a state, state\u2019s legislature or its administrative agencies to exercise eminent domain over private property, in addition to possible judicially imposed constraints on, and additional requirements for, the exercise of eminent domain. We also conduct operations on federal and other oil and natural gas leases inhabited by species that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, which listing could lead to tighter restrictions as to federal land use and other land use where federal approvals are required. These laws and regulations, together with any other changes in law related to the use of eminent domain or the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered, could inhibit or eliminate our ability to secure rights-of-way or otherwise access land for current or future pipeline construction projects. As a result, obtaining rights-of-way or other means of access may require additional regulatory and environmental compliance, and increased costs in connection therewith, which could delay our CO2 pipeline construction schedule and initiation of our pipeline operations, and/or increase the costs of constructing our pipelines. Pipeline projects are also subject to heightened levels of scrutiny as a result of public opposition to projects like the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. This scrutiny has the potential to result in\nDenbury Resources Inc.\npermitting delays, enhanced and prolonged environmental review for pipeline projects, and litigation challenges to regulatory agencies\u2019 authorizations of pipeline projects.\nOur future performance depends upon our ability to effectively develop our existing oil and natural gas reserves and find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.\nUnless we can successfully develop our existing reserves and/or replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations. We have historically replaced reserves through both acquisitions and internal organic growth activities. For internal organic growth activities, the magnitude of proved reserves that we can book in any given year depends on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response. In the future, we may not be able to continue to replace reserves at acceptable costs. The business of exploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive. We may not be able to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if our cash flows from operations continue to be reduced, whether due to current oil or natural gas prices or otherwise, or if external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. Further, the process of using CO2 for tertiary recovery, and the related infrastructure, requires significant capital investment prior to any resulting and associated production and cash flows from these projects, heightening potential capital constraints. If capital expenditures remain at reduced levels, or if outside capital resources become limited, we will not be able to maintain our current production levels.\nWe have acquired several fields at a substantial cost because we believe that they have significant additional production potential through tertiary flooding, and we may have the opportunity to acquire other oil fields that we believe are tertiary flood candidates, some of which may require significant amounts of capital. If we are unable to successfully develop and produce the potential oil in any acquired fields, it would negatively affect our return on investment relative to these acquisitions and could significantly reduce our ability to obtain additional capital for the future or fund future acquisitions, and also negatively affect our financial results to a significant degree.\nCommodity derivative contracts may expose us to potential financial loss.\nTo reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity derivative contracts in order to economically hedge a portion of our forecasted oil and natural gas production. As of February 22, 2017, we have oil derivative contracts in place covering 39,000 Bbls/d for the first quarter of 2017, 29,000 Bbls/d for the second quarter of 2017, 16,500 Bbls/d for the third quarter of 2017, and 13,000 Bbls/d for the fourth quarter of 2017. Such derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received, when the cash benefit from hedges including a sold put is limited to the extent oil prices fall below the price of our sold puts, or when the counterparty to the derivative contract is financially constrained and defaults on its contractual obligations. In addition, these derivative contracts may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas.\nShortages of or delays in the availability of oil field equipment, services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages in such personnel. In the past, during periods of high oil and natural gas prices, we have experienced shortages of oil field and other necessary equipment, including drilling rigs, along with increased prices for such equipment, services and associated personnel. These types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results and/or restrict or delay our ability to drill wells and conduct our operations, possibly causing us to miss our forecasts and projections.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation lines and other facilities, certain of which we do not control. When these facilities are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends, in part, upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation lines owned by third parties. In general, we do not control these transportation facilities, and our access to them may be limited or denied. A significant disruption in the availability of, and access to, these transportation lines or other production\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nfacilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations.\nOur production will decline if our access to sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide is limited.\nOur long-term strategy is primarily focused on our CO2 tertiary recovery operations. The crude oil production from our tertiary recovery projects depends, in large part, on having access to sufficient amounts of naturally occurring and industrial-sourced CO2. Our ability to produce oil from these projects would be hindered if our supply of CO2 was limited due to, among other things, problems with our current CO2 producing wells and facilities, including compression equipment, catastrophic pipeline failure or our ability to economically purchase CO2 from industrial sources. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our anticipated future crude oil production from tertiary operations is also dependent on the timing, volumes and location of CO2 injections and, in particular, on our ability to increase our combined purchased and produced volumes of CO2 and inject adequate amounts of CO2 into the proper formation and area within each of our tertiary oil fields.\nThe development of our naturally occurring CO2 sources involves the drilling of wells to increase and extend the CO2 reserves available for use in our tertiary fields. These drilling activities are subject to many of the same drilling and geological risks of drilling and producing oil and gas wells (see Oil and natural gas development and producing operations involve various risks above). Furthermore, recent market conditions may cause the delay or cancellation of construction of plants that produce industrial-source CO2 as a byproduct that we can purchase, thus limiting the amount of industrial-source CO2 available for our use in our tertiary operations.\nWe may lose executive officers, key management personnel or other talented employees, which could endanger the future success of our operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key management personnel. Our employees, including our executive officers, are employed at will and do not have employment agreements. If one or more members of our management team dies, becomes disabled or voluntarily terminates employment with us, there is no assurance that we will find a suitable or comparable substitute. We believe that our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial personnel. Historically, a significant portion of the compensation paid to our executive officers and key management personnel has been through long-term grants of Company stock under our 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (the \u201c2004 Plan\u201d). If the shares reserved under the 2004 Plan are depleted and not replenished, we may be forced to eliminate long-term equity grants, which would negatively impact our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial personnel. Replacing long-term equity grants with cash compensation would reduce the cash available to fund capital expenditures. Additionally, in a low oil price environment, we could be susceptible to losing talented non-industry professionals (e.g., accountants, attorneys and human resources personnel). Competition for persons with these skills is intense, and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled and talented personnel.\nGovernmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection are costly and stringent.\nOur exploration, production, and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including the protection of endangered species. These laws and regulations and related public policy considerations affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in order to comply. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations. In addition, some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for contamination resulting from spills, discharges, and releases of substances, including petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes, without regard to fault, or the legality of the original conduct. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination, including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators. While the President has indicated that his administration will relax enforcement of and work to repeal certain federal environmental regulations that affect the oil and gas industry, we are currently unable to predict what, if any, changes will be made or their timing.\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nEnactment of executive, legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business.\nNumerous executive, legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by the President, Congress, state legislatures and various federal and state agencies. While it is currently anticipated that the President and Congress will move away from the trend of proposing stricter standards and increasing oversight and regulation at the federal level, it is possible that other proposals affecting the oil and gas industry could be enacted or adopted in the future, which could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions that could have an effect on demand for oil and natural gas or prices at which it can be sold. However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and thereafter implemented, it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe new Presidential administration and Congress have stated that comprehensive U.S. tax reform is a priority and have discussed their intent to pursue major federal tax reform. If major tax revisions are made, it is possible that a number of special tax provisions affecting the oil and gas industry could be changed. The passage of legislation or any other change in U.S. federal income tax law that eliminates, reduces or postpones certain tax deductions that are currently available to us or otherwise increases our taxes could negatively affect the after-tax returns generated on our oil and gas investments, our cash flow or our financial condition and results of operations, even if reduced corporate tax rates are enacted.\nThe derivatives market regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market, including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. Our derivative transactions are not currently subject to such swap clearing and trade execution requirements; however, in the event our derivative transactions potentially become subject to such requirements, we believe that our derivative transactions would qualify for the \u201cend-user\u201d exception. The Dodd-Frank Act, rules promulgated thereunder or new legislation or regulations, could (1) affect the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives available to us to hedge against commodity price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (2) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, (3) affect the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and (4) increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives due to changes in the derivatives market, our cash flows could become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. On the other hand, there is significant uncertainty as to the status of the Dodd-Frank Act, and its regulations and enforcement, growing out of widespread discussion of repealing or scaling back the Dodd-Frank Act - either through legislative or regulatory action; however, it is not possible to determine at this time whether such changes will take place, in what form or to what extent.\nThe loss of one or more of our large oil and natural gas purchasers could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, two purchasers individually accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues and, in the aggregate, for 34% of such revenues. The loss of a large single purchaser could adversely impact the prices we receive or the transportation costs we incur.\nCertain of our operations may be limited during certain periods due to severe weather conditions and other regulations.\nCertain of our operations in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming, including the construction of CO2 pipelines, the drilling of new wells and production from existing wells, are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions, including severe cold, snow and rain, which conditions may cause such operations to be hindered or delayed, or otherwise require that they be conducted only during non-winter months, and depending on the severity of the weather, could have a negative effect on our results of operations in these areas. Further, certain of our operations in these areas are confined to certain time periods due to environmental regulations, federal restrictions on when drilling can take place on federal lands, and lease stipulations designed to protect certain wildlife, which regulations, restrictions and limitations could slow down our operations, cause delays, increase costs and have a negative effect on our results of operations. Our operations in the coastal areas of the Gulf Coast region may be subjected to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, which can also increase costs and have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nIf commodity prices decline appreciably, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nUnder full cost accounting rules related to our oil and natural gas properties, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation, with the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling. The present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves included in the cost center ceiling is based on the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during a 12-month rolling period prior to the end of a particular reporting period. During 2015 and 2016, we recorded full cost pool ceiling test write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties totaling $4.9 billion ($3.1 billion net of tax) and $810.9 million ($508.2 million net of tax), respectively (see Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Write-Down of Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Properties). Future material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties, as well as future impairment of other long-lived assets, could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which such write-down and/or impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to long-lived assets and equity. See Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.", "PERMNO": 82196, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "DNRCQ"}
