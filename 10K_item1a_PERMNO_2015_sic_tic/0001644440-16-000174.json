RISK FACTORS\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering investments in our company, you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: (1) risks relating to our business, (2) risks relating to the Separation and (3) risks relating to the ownership of company common stock. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting the Company and our business in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties the Company faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case or in the case that an additional risk or uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial develops into actual events, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face significant competition and, if we are not able to respond to competition, our revenues may decrease.\nWe face significant competition from a variety of competitors in each of our markets. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. New competitors also could enter our markets and certain of our customers could decide to self-manufacture or otherwise enter our markets. We consider product quality, performance, customer service, on-time delivery, price, distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in our markets. Our competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing, duplicate our strategies, or develop enhancements to products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products. Competitive pressures, including those described above, could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a loss of market share or decreases in prices, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe length and depth of product and industry business cycles in our segments may result in periods of reduced sales, earnings and cash flows, and portions of our business are subject to seasonality and weather-related effects.\nOur operating segments are sensitive to the cyclical nature of the industries they serve. Our construction business is cyclical in response to economic conditions and construction demand and is also seasonal and dependent on favorable weather conditions, with a decrease in construction activity during the winter months. Our packaging products are affected by seasonal and weather-related factors including the consumption of beverages and the size and quality of food crops.\nIf we are not able to continue our technological innovation and successful introduction of new products, our customers may turn to other suppliers to meet their requirements.\nThe specialty chemicals industry and the end-use applications into which we sell our products experience ongoing technological change and product improvements. A key element of our business strategy is to invest in research and development activities with the goal of introducing new high-performance, technically differentiated products. We may not be successful in developing new technology and products that successfully compete with products introduced by our competitors, and our customers may not accept or may have lower demand for, our new products. If we fail to keep pace with evolving technological innovations or fail to improve our products in response to our customers\u2019 needs, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of reduced sales of our products.\nPrices for certain raw materials are volatile and can have a significant effect on our manufacturing and supply chain strategies as we seek to maximize our profitability. If we are unable to successfully adjust our strategies in response to volatile raw materials prices, such volatility could have a negative effect on our earnings in future periods.\nWe use petroleum-based materials, natural gas derivatives and other materials in the manufacture of our products. Prices for these materials are volatile and can have a significant effect on our pricing, sales, manufacturing and supply chain strategies as we seek to maximize our profitability. Our ability to successfully adjust strategies in response to volatile raw material prices by increasing prices, reducing costs or taking other actions is a significant factor in maintaining or improving our profitability. If we are unable to successfully adjust our strategies in response to volatile prices, such volatility could have a negative effect on our sales and earnings in future periods.\nA substantial portion of our raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. We attempt to manage exposure to price volatility of major commodities through:\n\u2022\nlong-term supply contracts;\n\u2022\ncustomer contracts that permit adjustments for changes in prices of commodity-based materials and energy; and\n\u2022\nforward buying programs that layer in our expected requirements systematically over time;\nAlthough we regularly assess our exposure to raw material price volatility, we cannot always predict the prospects of volatility and we cannot always cover the risk in a cost-effective manner.\nWe have a policy of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for raw materials. However, certain of our raw materials may be provided by single sources of supply. We may not be able to obtain sufficient raw materials due to unforeseen developments that would cause an interruption in supply. Even if we have multiple sources of supply for raw materials, these sources may not make up for the loss of a major supplier.\nThe global scope of our operations subjects us to the risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate our business on a global scale with approximately 64% of our 2015 sales outside the United States. We operate in over 40 countries and in over 30 currencies. We currently have many production facilities, technical centers and administrative and sales offices located outside North America, including facilities and offices in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. We expect non-U.S. sales to continue to represent a substantial majority of our revenue. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and economic conditions as well as regulatory requirements of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in non-U.S. operations include the following:\n\u2022\ncommercial agreements may be more difficult to enforce and receivables more difficult to collect;\n\u2022\nintellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce;\n\u2022\nwe may experience increased shipping costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty transferring our profits or capital from foreign operations to other countries where such funds could be more profitably deployed;\n\u2022\nwe may experience unexpected adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses;\n\u2022\nsome foreign countries have adopted, and others may impose, additional withholding taxes or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange and capital controls;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may nationalize private enterprises;\n\u2022\nour business and profitability in a particular country could be affected by political or economic repercussions on a domestic, country specific or global level from terrorist activities and the response to such activities;\n\u2022\nwe may be affected by unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated events, such as geopolitical changes, could adversely affect our foreign operations.\nOur success as a global business will depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions by developing, implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business.\nIn particular, our ability to manage our Venezuelan operations has been and will continue to be negatively affected by difficult conditions in Venezuela, including continuing high inflation and the significant devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. Government regulations regarding price increases limit our ability to offset the effects of high inflation and the currency devaluations. Import authorization controls and the limited availability of foreign exchange limit our ability to import raw materials needed for the production of our products. In addition, labor laws limit our ability to manage overhead costs and, at times, production has been negatively impacted by local labor issues. Additional government actions, including in the form of further currency devaluations or effective devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls, foreign exchange or price or profit controls could have further adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as could further deterioration in the Venezuelan economy resulting from the decline in the price of oil or from other factors.\nWe have no assurance that we will be able to sustain operations in Venezuela. Economic factors as well as further government actions affecting our ability to do business (including the possibility of nationalization, expropriation of assets or other similar actions) could affect both our results of operations as well as our accounting presentation for the Venezuelan business. Specialty Construction Chemicals and Darex Packaging Technologies have operated in Venezuela for several decades with sales in that country representing approximately 8% of each segment\u2019s sales in 2015. The future sales of our Venezuelan subsidiary are expected to be immaterial after September 30, 2015 due to Venezuela's currency devaluation.\nFor additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in Venezuela, refer to the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nCertain of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and we could be materially and adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because certain of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities, we are subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of anti-bribery laws or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate changes that impact our profitability.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate risk through our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may materially affect our operating results. For example, changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which we and our competitors sell products in the same region and the cost of materials used in our operations. A substantial portion of our net sales and assets are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, at a constant level of business, our reported sales, earnings, assets and liabilities are reduced because the non-U.S. currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars. In addition, since we manufacture a portion of our construction products and packaging products in emerging regions using raw materials from suppliers in the U.S., Europe and other advanced economies, changes in the values of the currencies of these emerging regions versus the U.S. dollar, the euro and the currencies of other advanced economies in which we purchase raw materials, may adversely affect our raw material costs.\nWe incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary's functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to manage our currency transaction risks effectively or volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to significant additional risk.\nFollowing the Separation, we will have debt obligations that could restrict our business, adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or restrict our ability to return cash to shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $68.0 million of unsecured indebtedness outstanding. Immediately following the Separation, we had a total combined indebtedness for borrowed money of approximately $826 million, including approximately $750 million borrowed, in part, to pay a distribution to Grace prior to the Separation. The amount of and terms governing the Company's indebtedness may have material effects on our business, including to:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt payments, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development, distributions to holders of company common stock and other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or taking advantage of favorable business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic, credit and industry conditions, including recessions;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt service and other obligations;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have relatively less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other purposes.\nWe may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If we incur additional debt, the risks related to our indebtedness may intensify.\nWe require liquidity to service the Company's debt and to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions and other corporate expenses.\nOur ability to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions and other corporate expenses, including repayment of our debt, depends on our ability to generate cash through future operating performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that our businesses will generate sufficient cash or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to fund all of our requirements. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to fund all of our requirements, we may need to pursue one or more alternatives, such as to:\n\u2022\nreduce or delay planned capital expenditures, research and development spending or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nobtain additional financing or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity;\n\u2022\nsell assets or businesses; and\n\u2022\nsell additional equity.\nAny reduction or delay in planned capital expenditures, research and development spending or acquisitions or sale of assets or businesses may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise additional equity capital, restructure or refinance any of our debt or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nRestrictions imposed by agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business, finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities. If we fail to comply with certain restrictions under these agreements, our debt could be accelerated and the Company may not have sufficient cash to pay the accelerated debt.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness may contain various covenants that we expect may limit, among other things, our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to:\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of our guarantors.\nAs a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions may limit our flexibility to operate our business. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in these agreements, including maintaining the financial ratios that we expect to be required by our credit facilities, could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness. We cannot assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient to enable us to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that we expect to govern our indebtedness or to remedy any such default. In addition, in the event that repayment of our debt is accelerated pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make such accelerated payments.\nOur indebtedness exposes us to interest expense increases if interest rates increase.\nAs of the Separation, we had approximately $301 million, or 36%, of our borrowings, at a variable interest rates and exposed us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same, and our net income would decrease. An increase of 1% in the interest rates payable on the variable rate indebtedness at the time of the Separation and distribution would increase our annual estimated debt-service requirements by approximately $3 million, assuming our consolidated variable interest rate indebtedness outstanding as of the time of the Separation and distribution remains the same.\nWe have unfunded and underfunded pension plan liabilities. We will require future operating cash flow to fund these liabilities. We have no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash to satisfy these obligations.\nWe maintain U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering current and former employees who meet or met age and service requirements. Our net pension liability and cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the longevity and actuarial profile of our workforce, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. In addition, any changes in the discount rate could result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following years. Similarly, changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost in the following years.\nWhen consistent with our business strategies, we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions that complement or expand our businesses. We may not be able to complete proposed transactions and even if completed, the transactions may not achieve the earnings, cash flow or returns on investment that we had contemplated.\nWe have recently completed a number of acquisitions that we believe will contribute to our future success. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current businesses or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty identifying appropriate opportunities or, if we do identify opportunities, we may not be successful in completing transactions for a number of reasons. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from our existing businesses to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture;\n\u2022\npossible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process;\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired business to achieve expected operational objectives; and\n\u2022\nour possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or their employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which may lead to operational inefficiencies.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by warranty claims and product liability.\nWe provide standard warranties that our products perform according to their specifications and do not have material defects. In particular, for a limited number of high value construction projects we warrant the performance of some products for periods of 10 to 20 years. Our products are generally sold to the commercial construction, residential construction and food packaging industries and they often constitute an integral part of our customers\u2019 products. If our products do not meet specifications, are otherwise defective, or are used contrary to our instructions or in applications for which they are not designed, they may contribute to damage to our customers\u2019 products, the end users of our customers\u2019 products and buildings and other installations that contain our products. Although we take measures to avoid product defects and instruct our customers on the proper use of our products, if a substantial warranty claim or product liability lawsuit is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim or lawsuit could be significant and any adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe manufacture and sell products into many global jurisdictions where our efforts to contractually limit our liability (e.g. by defining a maximum liability, disclaiming implied or other statutory forms of liability or by waiving certain types of damages, including consequential, indirect and non-proximately caused damages) may not be enforceable or may be found by a court to not apply in a particular situation.\nWe work with dangerous materials that can injure our employees, damage our facilities and disrupt our operations.\nSome of our operations involve the handling of hazardous materials that may pose the risk of fire, explosion or the release of hazardous substances. Such events could result from terrorist attacks, natural disasters or operational failures, and might cause injury or loss of life to our employees and others, environmental contamination, and property damage. These events might cause a temporary shutdown of an affected plant or portion thereof, and we could be subject to penalties or claims as a result. A disruption of our operations caused by these or other events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be required to spend large amounts of money for environmental compliance.\nAs a manufacturer of specialty chemicals and specialty materials, we are subject to stringent regulations under numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of hazardous wastes and other materials. We expend funds to comply with such laws and regulations and have established a policy to minimize our emissions to the environment. Nevertheless, legislative, regulatory and economic uncertainties (including existing and potential laws and regulations pertaining to climate change) make it difficult for us to project future spending for these purposes and if there is an acceleration in new regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend additional funds to remain in compliance.\nSome of our employees are unionized, represented by works councils or employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 2,900 total employees, of which 680 were employed in the United States. Of our total U.S. employees, approximately 85 are unionized. In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws in the United States. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. For example, most of our employees in Europe are represented by works councils that have co-determination rights on any changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce. A strike, work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees, whether or not related to these negotiations, could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could hurt our business or financial performance.\nFrom time to time, we face claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe or otherwise misappropriate their intellectual property rights. Any claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of the claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending and resolving the claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business. If we are found to be infringing or misappropriating intellectual property of others, we may be liable for damages, including damages that may have occurred from our customers using any infringing products, and we may be required to change our processes, redesign our products, pay others to use the technology or stop using the technology or producing the infringing product or otherwise exploiting the misappropriated intellectual property. Even if we ultimately prevail, the existence of the lawsuit could prompt our customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement or misappropriation suits.\nWe are subject to business continuity risks associated with centralization of certain administrative functions.\nWe have centralized certain administrative functions in a few designated centers around the world, to improve efficiency and reduce costs. To the extent that these central locations are disrupted or disabled, key business processes, such as invoicing, payments and general management operations, could be interrupted.\nA failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology (IT) infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nRisks Relating to the Separation\nWe have no history operating as an independent public company. We will incur significant costs to create the corporate infrastructure necessary to operate as an independent public company, and we may experience increased ongoing costs in connection with being an independent public company.\nWe have historically used Grace\u2019s corporate infrastructure to support our business functions, including information technology systems. Previously, the expenses related to establishing and maintaining this infrastructure were spread among all of Grace\u2019s businesses. Following the Separation and after the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement, we will no longer have access to Grace\u2019s infrastructure, and we will need to establish our own. We expect to incur costs beginning in 2015 to establish necessary standalone infrastructure.\nGrace previously performed many important corporate functions for us, including some information technology, treasury, tax administration, accounting, financial reporting, human resources, compensation, legal and other services. Following the Separation, Grace continues to provide some of these services to us on a transitional basis, generally for a period of up to 18 months, pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. Grace may not successfully execute all these functions during the transition period or we may have to expend significant efforts or costs materially in excess of those estimated under the Transition Services Agreement. Any interruption in these services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. In addition, at the end of this transition period, we will need to perform these functions ourselves or hire third parties to perform these functions on our behalf. The costs associated with performing or outsourcing these functions may exceed the amounts reflected in our historical combined financial statements or that we have agreed to pay Grace during the transition period. A significant increase in the costs of performing or outsourcing these functions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring fiscal year 2015 and prior to the Separation, we were not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the \u201cExchange Act.\u201d However, since the Separation, we have become directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require, annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of these controls. These reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on our management and administrative and operational resources, including accounting resources.\nWe may not realize the potential benefits from the Separation, and our historical combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of our future performance.\nWe may not realize the potential benefits we expect from our Separation from Grace. In addition, we will incur significant costs, including those described below, which may exceed our estimates, and we will incur some\nnegative effects from our Separation from Grace, including loss of access to some of the financial, managerial and professional resources from which we have benefited in the past.\nOur historical combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition, future results of operations or future cash flows, nor does it reflect what our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented. The historical combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows primarily because of the following factors:\n\u2022\nOur historical combined financial statements reflect allocations of expenses for services historically provided by Grace, and those allocations may be significantly lower than the comparable expenses we would have incurred as an independent company;\n\u2022\nOur working capital requirements historically have been satisfied as part of Grace\u2019s corporate-wide cash management programs, and our cost of debt and other capital may significantly differ from that reflected in our historical combined financial statements;\n\u2022\nThe historical combined financial statements may not fully reflect the costs associated with the Company being an independent public company, including significant changes that may occur in our cost structure, management, financing arrangements and business operations as a result of our Separation from Grace including all the costs related to being an independent public company; and\n\u2022\nThe historical combined financial statements may not fully reflect the effects of certain liabilities that we will incur or assume.\nOur historical combined financial statements may not give effect to various ongoing additional costs we may incur in connection with being an independent public company. Accordingly, our historical combined financial statements do not reflect what our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would have been as an independent public company and is not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition or future results of operations.\nPlease refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and our historical combined financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf the distribution and certain related transactions fail to qualify under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions, Grace, the Company and Grace shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, the Company could be required to indemnify Grace for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement.\nAs a condition to the distribution that effected the Separation, Grace was required to receive an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to Grace in its sole discretion, regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the distribution and certain related transactions. The opinion of counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Grace and us, including those relating to our and Grace's past and future conduct. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings were, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Grace or we breach any of its or our covenants in the Separation documents, such as the Tax Sharing Agreement, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions failed to qualify under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel were based were false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. The opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position.\nIf the distribution is determined to fail to qualify under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions, then, in general, Grace may recognize taxable gain as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value (unless Grace and GCP jointly make an election under Section 336(e) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) with respect to the distribution, in which case, in general, we would (i) recognize taxable gain as if we had\nsold all of our assets in a taxable sale in exchange for an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock and the assumption of all of our liabilities and (ii) obtain a related step up in the basis of our assets), and Grace shareholders at the time of the distribution who received shares of our common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nUnder the Tax Sharing Agreement entered into between Grace and GCP, we may be required to indemnify Grace against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (1) an acquisition under certain circumstances of all or a portion of our equity securities or assets, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (2) other actions that we may take or fail to, or (3) any of our representations or undertakings made in connection with the Separation and the distribution being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. In addition, Grace, GCP and our respective subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Separation, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from Separations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material.\nU.S. federal income tax consequences may restrict our ability to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions following the distribution.\nUnder current law, a Separation can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its shareholders as a result of certain post-separation acquisitions of shares or assets of the spun-off corporation. For example, a separation may result in taxable gain to the parent corporation under Section 355(e) of the Tax Code if the Separation were later deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons, directly or indirectly, acquire shares representing a 50 percent or greater interest (by vote or value) in the spun-off corporation. To preserve the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Separation and distribution, and in addition to our indemnity obligation described immediately above, the Tax Sharing Agreement restricts GCP, for the two-year period following the distribution, except in specified circumstances, from:\n\u2022\nEntering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of our assets or shares of our common stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u2022\nIssuing GCP equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u2022\nRepurchasing our shares other than in certain open-market transactions;\n\u2022\nCeasing to actively conduct or run certain of our businesses; or\n\u2022\nTaking or failing to take any other action that jeopardizes the expected U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Separation and certain related transactions.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business.\nIn connection with the Separation, Grace has agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify Grace for certain liabilities. If the Company is required to act on these indemnities to Grace, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. The Grace indemnity may not be sufficient to insure the Company against the full amount of liabilities for which it may be allocated responsibility, and Grace may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement, Grace agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Grace for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Grace in each case for uncapped amounts, as discussed further in \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions-Agreements with Grace.\u201d Indemnities that we may be required to provide Grace are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the distribution and certain related transactions. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Grace has agreed to retain. Further, the indemnity from Grace may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Grace may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Grace any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAfter the Separation, certain of Grace\u2019s insurance policies may not cover us for losses associated with occurrences prior to the Separation.\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into agreements with Grace to address several matters associated with the Separation, including insurance coverage. After the Separation, some of Grace\u2019s insurance policies may not cover us for certain losses associated with occurrences prior to the Separation.\nSeveral members of our Board of Directors and management may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their ownership of shares of common stock of Grace.\nSeveral members of our Board of Directors and management own common stock of Grace and/or stock options to purchase common stock of Grace or other equity-based awards because of their current or prior relationships with Grace, which could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Grace and our Company. See \u201cManagement.\u201d\nTransfer or assignment to us of certain contracts, investments in joint ventures and other assets may require the consent of a third party. If such consent is not given, the Company may not be entitled to the benefit of such contracts, investments and other assets in the future.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that in connection with the Separation from Grace, a number of contracts with customers, suppliers, landlords and other third-parties were to be assigned from Grace or its affiliates to us or our affiliates. However, some of these contracts require the contractual counterparty\u2019s consent to such an assignment. Similarly, in some circumstances, we and one or more business units of Grace are joint beneficiaries of contracts, and we will need to enter into a new agreement with the third-party to replicate the contract or assign the portion of the contract related to our business. It is possible that some parties may use the requirement of a consent or the fact that the Separation is occurring to seek more favorable contractual terms from us or to seek to terminate the contract. If (1) we are unable to complete the assignments in a timely manner, (2) we enter into new agreements on significantly less favorable terms, or (3) if the contracts are terminated, we may be unable to obtain the benefits, assets and contractual commitments which are intended to be allocated to us as part of the Separation from Grace. The failure to timely complete the assignment of existing contracts, or the negotiation of new arrangements, with any of our large customers or key suppliers (including those that are single source or limited source suppliers), or a termination of any of those arrangements, could negatively impact our financial condition and future results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of GCP Common Stock\nOur share price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly or annual earnings results or those of other companies in the industry;\n\u2022\nfailures of our operating results to meet the estimates of securities analysts or the expectations of shareholders or changes by securities analysts in their estimates of our future earnings;\n\u2022\nannouncements made by us or our customers, suppliers or competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations which adversely affect us or our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and stock market conditions;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of company common stock by shareholders;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of our common stock by us; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA large number of the Company\u2019s shares are or will be eligible for future sale, which may cause the market price for company common stock to decline.\nUpon completion of the Separation and distribution, we had outstanding an aggregate of 70,538,445 shares of common stock. Virtually all of those shares were freely tradeable without restriction or registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We are unable to predict whether large amounts of our common stock will be sold in the open market following the Separation and distribution. We are also unable to predict whether a sufficient number of buyers would be in the market at that time. It is possible that Grace shareholders have sold or will sell the shares of company common stock they received in the distribution for various reasons. For example, such shareholders may not believe that our business profile or our level of market capitalization as an independent company fits their investment objectives. The sale of significant amounts of our common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may lower the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s corporate documents, the Tax Sharing Agreement and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change-in-control of the Company, even if that change may be considered beneficial by some Company shareholders.\nThe existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorization of a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued, which may permit our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of the Company's management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of the Company;\n\u2022\nprohibition on shareholders calling special meetings and taking action by written consent;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the Company's Board of Directors and for proposing matters to be acted on by shareholders at the annual shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe temporary classification of our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nsupermajority voting requirements for certain amendments to the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or shareholder proposals for amendments to the Company\u2019s bylaws.\nIn addition, since the Separation, the Company has been and is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Company's Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of company common stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing the Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal as compared to its long term plan as a standalone company. However, these provisions apply even if a proposal may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of GCP and our shareholders.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. For a discussion of Section 355(e). The Company may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions following the distribution. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company would be required to indemnify Grace for any resulting tax and related amounts, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable.\nThe Company may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of company common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes it to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and\ndistributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of company common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nThe Company does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain future earnings to finance our business. As a result, GCP does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. All decisions regarding the payment of dividends by GCP will be made by our Board of Directors from time to time in accordance with applicable law. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends at any time in the future. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or other currently unknown reasons. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate in order for you to receive a gain on your investment. This appreciation may not occur. Further, you may have to sell some or all of your shares of our common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment.", "PERMNO": 15917, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "GCP"}
