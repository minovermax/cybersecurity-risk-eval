financial condition, results of operations and relationships with customers.\n\u2022Disruptions in the U.S. or worldwide economy may materially and adversely affect Stryve\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022Due to Stryve\u2019s limited number of key employees, the loss of services of any of Stryve\u2019s key employees could have a material adverse effect on Stryve\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRegulatory Risks\n\u2022The loss of Stryve\u2019s USDA grant of inspection from its facility would materially adversely impact its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022Stryve is subject to extensive government regulations and a failure to comply with such regulations could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022If Stryve chooses to expand internationally, it will be subject to international regulations that could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit Stryve\u2019s business activities, increase its

adequately protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to its business.\nRisks Related to Stryve Being a Public Company\n\u2022Stryve has not been managed as a public company and its current resources and management personnel may not be sufficient to fulfill its public company obligations.\n\u2022Stryve will incur significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and its management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance efforts.\n\u2022If Stryve does not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, it could fail to report its financial results accurately.\nRisks Related to Our Securities Generally\n\u2022 The price for our securities has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\n\u2022Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\n\u2022The Warrants may not be in the money at the time they become exercisable, and they may expire worthless.\n\u2022We do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nRisks Related to Stryve\u2019s Business, Brand, Products and Industry\nStryve has a history of losses and may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nStryve has experienced net losses since its inception. In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Stryve incurred net losses of $32.0 million and $17.5 million, respectively. Stryve anticipates that its operating expenses and capital expenditures may likely increase in the foreseeable future as it continues to invest to increase its customer base and supplier network, expand its product offerings and brands, expand marketing channels, invest in distribution and manufacturing facilities, hire additional employees and enhance technology and production capabilities. The efforts to grow may prove more expensive than anticipated, and Stryve may not succeed in increasing its revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. In addition, many of Stryve\u2019s expenses, including certain costs associated with its existing and any future manufacturing facilities, are fixed and may impact Stryve's ability to reduce its losses. Accordingly, Stryve may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability and it may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral economic or geopolitical conditions, including Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine and the impact of pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), may disrupt Stryve\u2019s business, including, among other things, consumption and trade patterns, supply chain, and production processes, each of which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve's overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced significant economic and market downturns in the past, and\nare likely to experience additional cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity is impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, inflation, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can be difficult to predict. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets.\nIn addition, the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as COVID-19, could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks may affect demand for Stryve\u2019s products because quarantines or other government restrictions on movement may cause erratic consumer purchase behavior. Governmental or societal impositions of restrictions on public gatherings, especially if prolonged, may have adverse effects on in-person traffic to retail stores. Even the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect traffic to Stryve\u2019s store-based retail consumers and, in turn, its business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if any self-imposed or government-imposed restrictions are in place for significant time.\nThe spread of pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 may also disrupt Stryve\u2019s third-party business partners\u2019 ability to meet their obligations, which may negatively affect Stryve's operations. These third parties include those who supply Stryve\u2019s ingredients, packaging, and other necessary operating materials, distributors, and logistics and transportation services providers. The COVID-19 pandemic led, and could again lead, to interruptions in the delivery of beef and other supplies arising from delays or restrictions on shipping or manufacturing, closures of supplier or distributor facilities or financial distress or insolvency of suppliers or distributors. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, transport restrictions related to quarantines or travel bans were put in place and supply may become constrained, each of which may cause price increases or shortages of certain ingredients and raw materials used in Stryve\u2019s products and/or it may experience disruptions to its operations. Further, Stryve\u2019s ability to manufacture its products may be impaired by any material disruption to its manufacturing facility in Oklahoma because of COVID-19 or similar outbreaks. If a significant percentage of Stryve\u2019s workforce cannot work, including because of illness, travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks, its operations may be negatively affected.\nStryve\u2019s results of operations depend on, among other things, its ability to maintain and increase sales volume with existing customers, to attract new consumers and to provide products that appeal to consumers at prices they are willing and able to pay. Stryve\u2019s ability to implement its advertising, display and promotion activities designed to maintain and increase its sales volumes on a timely basis, including the ability to do in-person retail product demonstrations designed to attract new customers, have been and may continue to be negatively affected because of modifications to retailer shelf reset timing or retailer pullback on in-store display and promotional activities during the COVID-19 outbreak or similar situations. Retailers may also alter their normal inventory receiving and product restocking practices during pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, which may negatively affect Stryve\u2019s business.\nStryve\u2019s operations during 2021 were affected by changes in consumer shopping and consumption behavior due to COVID-19. Stryve\u2019s retail sales decreased during the second and third quarters of 2020 as a result of a decrease of in-person shopping trips. It is unclear how long such changes in consumer patterns will persist or if they will worsen and how they may impact Stryve's retail velocities. Notwithstanding the forgoing Stryve's retail sales rebounded in 2021, which management believes is primarily due to retail distribution gains.\nStryve's efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond its control.\nThe cost of beef, other raw material and packaging costs has been volatile and has recently risen significantly, which has negatively impacted the ability of Stryve to achieve profitability and has negatively impacted its gross margins.\nStryve purchases large quantities of raw materials to make its products, including beef. Historically, beef prices have fluctuated in response to a number of factors, including changes in the United States government farm support programs, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, weather, animal disease and other conditions. In\naddition, Stryve purchases and uses significant quantities of cardboard, film and plastic to package its products. Costs of raw materials, ingredients and packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, weather conditions, consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs.\nRecently, the price of beef, raw materials and other supplies Stryve purchases has increased significantly as a result of COVID-19 measures, inflation, transportation costs, the war in Ukraine and other factors. It is unclear when and whether and if such prices will normalize. Stryve may not be able to implement price increases for its products to cover any increased costs and any price increases it does implement may result in lower sales volumes. If Stryve is not successful in managing its beef, raw material and packaging costs, or if it is unable to increase prices to cover increased costs and maintain the Company's gross margins or if such price increases reduce sales volumes, then such increases in costs will adversely affect its business, profitability, gross margins, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve relies on a limited number of third-party suppliers, and may not be able to obtain beef and other raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities to produce its products or meet the demand for its products.\nStryve relies on a limited number of vendors and key brokers to supply it with beef and other raw materials, and its financial performance depends in large part on its ability to purchase beef and other raw materials in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. Stryve is not assured of continued supply or pricing of beef or other raw materials. Stryve typically does not have any formal contracts or agreements in place with any meat providers and purchases meat as demand requires in order to produce its products. Any of Stryve\u2019s suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationship with Stryve. During 2021 and into 2022, as beef suppliers across North America faced production challenges, the price of beef and other raw meats increased materially. If Stryve\u2019s suppliers continue to experience problems with their businesses, finances, labor relations, ability to import raw materials, costs, production, insurance and reputation, as well as natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic occurrences, it could impair Stryve\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient raw materials at competitive prices and negatively impact Stryve's gross margins.\nGiven the minimally processed nature of biltong production, the quality of the beef used in Stryve\u2019s products is important. Currently, the availability of grass-fed beef in the United States can be scarce at times, and may require Stryve to seek such beef internationally. Any interruption in the supply of high quality beef due to supply, disease, war, cost of transportation, labor shortages or other unforeseen circumstances would negatively impact Stryve\u2019s business. If Stryve needs to replace an existing beef supplier or another supplier of raw materials, there can be no assurance that supplies will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all, or that a new supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to Stryve in order to meet its requirements, fill orders in a timely manner or meet Stryve\u2019s quality standards. Any disruption (or price increases) in the supply of beef or other raw materials from its suppliers could materially and adversely affect its business, profitability, gross margins, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve may not be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive snacking and nutritional snacking industry.\nStryve\u2019s competitors include companies selling beef jerky and other meat snacks, as well as companies in the nutritional snack industry in general, including those selling meal replacement bars and other healthy snacks. The snacking industry is large and intensely competitive. Competitive factors include product quality, taste, brand awareness among consumers, nutritional content, simpler and less processed ingredients, innovation of \u201con-trend\u201d snacks, variety of snacks offered, grocery aisle placement, access to retailer shelf space, price, advertising and promotion, product packaging and package design. Stryve competes in this market against numerous multinational, regional and local companies principally based on product taste and quality, brand recognition and loyalty, nutritional content, marketing, advertising and price. Views towards nutritional snacking, and other nutritional approaches, are cyclical, with constantly changing consumer perceptions. If consumers do not perceive that a meat-based, low-carb, low-sugar and protein-rich eating approach is healthy or effective, Stryve\u2019s business could be adversely affected.\nMany of Stryve\u2019s competitors have resources substantially greater than Stryve and sell brands that are more widely recognized than its brands and may offer generic or private-label products at more competitive prices than its brands. Stryve\u2019s current and potential competitors may offer products similar to its products, offer a wider range of products than it offers, offer such products at more competitive prices than Stryve or decide to build a biltong facility and start\ncompeting directly with Stryve\u2019s biltong products. Local or regional markets often have significant additional competitors, many of whom offer products similar to Stryve\u2019s and may have unique ties to regional or national retail chains. Other label, generic or store-branded products may be a less expensive option for consumers than Stryve products, making it more difficult to sell Stryve branded products. Any increased or new competition from existing meat snacking companies, including an expansion of their products to biltong products, or new products or entrants from other nutritious snack companies, could cause reductions in Stryve\u2019s sales, require it to reduce prices, or both, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve\u2019s brand and reputation may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or health issues with its products, including meat, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReal or perceived quality or food safety concerns or failures to comply with applicable food regulations and requirements, whether or not based on fact and whether or not involving Stryve (such as incidents involving meat-based products in general), could cause negative publicity and reduced confidence in Stryve, its brand or products, or meat-based products in general, which could in turn harm its reputation and sales, and could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Although Stryve believes it has rigorous food safety and quality control processes, there can be no assurance that its products will always comply with the standards set for its products.\nStryve has no control over its products once purchased by consumers. Consumers may improperly store Stryve\u2019s products, which may adversely affect their quality and safety. If consumers do not perceive Stryve\u2019s products to be safe or of high quality, then the value of its brand would be diminished. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative publicity about Stryve, its brands or products, on social, digital or other media could seriously damage its brands and reputation, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Stryve fails to implement its growth strategies successfully, timely, or at all, its ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nStryve\u2019s success depends in large part on its ability to implement its growth strategies effectively. Stryve expects to continue its focus on nutritious meat snack products and intends to add additional brands and other products to its portfolio. Stryve\u2019s ability to expand successfully depends on, among other things, its ability to identify, and successfully cater to, new demographics and consumer trends, develop new products, identify and acquire additional product lines and businesses, secure shelf space in grocery stores, wholesale clubs and other retailers, increase its direct e-commerce sales, increase consumer awareness of its brands, enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third-party retailers and other potential distributors of its products, and compete with numerous other companies and products.\nConsumers are constantly seeking new products and strategies to achieve their healthy eating goals. Stryve\u2019s success depends heavily on its ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, the technical capability of its innovation staff in developing and testing product prototypes, including complying with applicable governmental regulations, and the success of its management and sales and marketing teams in marketing its new and existing products, including familiarizing consumers in the United States with biltong. Failure to develop and market new products that appeal to consumers may lead to a decrease in Stryve\u2019s sales and impact its ability to achieve profitability. Additionally, the development and introduction of new products requires substantial research, development and marketing expenditures, which Stryve may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance.\nStryve may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategies, expand its brands, develop brand loyalty or continue to maintain growth in sales at its current rate, or at all. If Stryve fails to implement its growth strategies or if it invests resources in growth strategies that prove unsuccessful, its sales and ability to achieve profitability may be negatively affected, which would materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Stryve fails to effectively manage its manufacturing and production capacity, its business and operating results and brand reputation could be harmed.\nIf Stryve does not have sufficient capacity to meet its customers\u2019 demands and to satisfy increased demand, it will need to expand its operations, supply and manufacturing capabilities. Stryve may not be able to effectively scale production processes and effectively manage its supply chain requirements. Stryve may not be able to accurately forecast demand for its products, since its forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. Any failure to accurately forecast demand for its products may affect Stryve\u2019s ability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity (whether its own manufacturing capacity or co-manufacturing capacity) in order to meet the demand for its products, which could harm its brand and business, and in some cases may result in discounts, credits or other payments to customers or distributors if it is unable to fulfill orders placed by them in a timely manner or at all.\nIf Stryve overestimates demand for its products, it may have significantly underutilized assets and may experience reduced margins. If Stryve does not accurately align its manufacturing capabilities with demand for its products, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMost of Stryve\u2019s air-dried meat products are manufactured in its single facility in Oklahoma and any damage to or disruption at this facility would materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve manufactures substantially all of its air-dried meat products at a single facility in Oklahoma. A natural disaster, tornado, fire, power interruption, pandemic, work stoppage (due to a COVID-19 outbreak or otherwise), regulatory or food safety issue or other problem at this facility would significantly disrupt Stryve\u2019s ability to manufacture and deliver its products and operate its business. Stryve\u2019s manufacturing facility and equipment is costly and may require substantial time to replace or repair if necessary. During such time, Stryve may not be able to find suitable co-manufacturers to replace the output from Stryve\u2019s facility on a timely basis or at a reasonable cost, if at all. Stryve may also experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of regulatory issues, equipment failure or delays in raw material deliveries. Any such disruption or unanticipated event may cause significant interruptions or delays in Stryve\u2019s business. While Stryve has property and business interruption insurance for its manufacturing facility, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Stryve\u2019s potential losses, and may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any disruption in the operation of Stryve\u2019s manufacturing facility, or damage to a material amount of its equipment or inventory, would materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve currently relies on sales to a limited number of retailers and losing one or more such retailers could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of Stryve\u2019s sales is generated from a limited number of retailers. These retailers, or other large customers, may take actions that affect Stryve for reasons it cannot anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the perceived quality of Stryve\u2019s products and the availability of competing products. There can be no assurance Stryve\u2019s customers will continue to purchase its products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past.\nStryve\u2019s customers rarely provide it with firm, long- or short-term volume purchase commitments. As a result, Stryve could have periods with limited orders for its products while still incurring costs related to workforce maintenance, marketing, manufacturing and general corporate expenses. Stryve may not find new customers to supplement its revenue in periods when it experiences reduced purchase orders, or recover fixed costs incurred during those periods, which could materially and adversely affect Stryve\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation of customers or the loss of a significant customer could negatively impact Stryve\u2019s sales and ability to achieve profitability.\nSupermarkets in North America and elsewhere continue to consolidate. This consolidation has produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases, as well as operate with lower inventories, decrease the number of brands that they carry, and increase their emphasis on private label products, all of which could negatively impact Stryve\u2019s business. The consolidation of retail customers also\nincreases the risk that a significant adverse impact on their business could have a corresponding material adverse impact on Stryve\u2019s business.\nThe loss of any large customer, the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from a large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact Stryve\u2019s sales and ability to achieve profitability. Furthermore, as retailers consolidate, they may reduce the number of branded products they offer in order to accommodate private label products and generate more competitive terms from branded suppliers. Consequently, Stryve\u2019s financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the actions of one or more significant retailers. A retailer may take actions that affect Stryve for reasons that cannot be anticipated or controlled, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the introduction of competing products or the perceived quality of Stryve\u2019s products. Despite operating in different channels, Stryve\u2019s retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, retailers may take actions that could negatively affect Stryve\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve\u2019s growth may be limited if it is unable to add additional shelf or retail space for its products.\nStryve\u2019s results will depend on its ability to drive revenue growth, in part, by expanding the distribution channels for its products. However, Stryve\u2019s ability to do so may be limited by an inability to secure additional shelf or retail space for its products. Shelf and retail space for nutritional snacks is limited and subject to competitive and other pressures, and there can be no assurance that retail operators will provide sufficient shelf space nor that online retailers will provide Stryve online access to their platform to enable Stryve to meet its growth objectives.\nChanges in retail distribution arrangements may result in the temporary loss of retail shelf space and disrupt sales of food products which could materially and adversely affect Stryve\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, retailers may change distribution centers that supply some of their retail stores. If a new distribution center or partner has not previously distributed Stryve\u2019s products in that region, it may take time for a retailer\u2019s distribution center or partner to begin distributing new products in its region. Even if a retailer approves a new distribution method in a region, Stryve\u2019s sales may decline while the transition in distribution method takes place. If Stryve does not get approval to have its products offered in a new distribution region or if getting this approval takes longer than anticipated, Stryve\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, Stryve relies on the performance of distribution partners to ensure the timely and accurate distribution of its products to certain retail customers. Should one of these distributions partners fail to timely and accurately distribute Stryve\u2019s products, it may result in limited products available for purchase, poor supplier reviews, and potentially loss of retail shelf space which could materially and adversely affect Stryve\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSlotting fees and customer charges or charge-backs for promotion allowances, cooperative advertising, and product or packaging damages, as well as undelivered or unsold food products may disrupt Stryve\u2019s customer relationships and could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRetailers may charge slotting fees for access to shelf space and often enter into promotional and advertising arrangements with manufacturers that result in the sharing of promotional and advertising costs among the retail customer, distributor or manufacturer. As the retail industry has consolidated and become more competitive, retailers have sought greater participation by manufacturers in cooperative promotional and advertising arrangements and may seek to pass on unanticipated increases in promotional and advertising costs to distributors and manufacturers. If Stryve is charged significant and unanticipated promotional allowances or advertising charges directly or indirectly by retail customers, or if Stryve, its third-party distributors, retailers or its other direct or indirect customers take substantial charge-backs or return material amounts of its products, its operating results and liquidity could be harmed, perhaps substantially. Moreover, unresolved disagreements with retail customers concerning invoiced costs to carry its products could significantly disrupt or cause the termination of customer relationships. If Stryve fails to effectively manage costs and charges concerning promotional allowances, advertising charges, charge-backs or returns, such failures could materially and adversely affect Stryve\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve offers a limited number of products and any change in consumer demand for biltong products or meat products in general could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDried meat snack products have been the focal point of Stryve\u2019s sales, product development and marketing efforts and Stryve believes that such products will continue to constitute the primary portion of its sales and cash flow for the foreseeable future. Any change in consumer perceptions or negative developments associated with the consumption, safety, health or benefits of the human consumption of meat, including but not limited to biltong and beef jerky products, could cause a decrease in demand for biltong or meat products in general, which would negatively impact Stryve\u2019s business and operations. Stryve may also be unable to convince healthy snackers to try its meat snack products. In addition, Stryve cannot be certain that it will be able to expand to new product offerings, as the food industry in general involves evolving consumer preferences and new and changing nutritional and health-related concerns. If Stryve is unable to identify and react appropriately to changes in consumer trends, demands and preferences, it may experience reduced demand and price reduction for its products, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve may not successfully increase production capacity at its manufacturing facility or its facility may not operate in accordance with its expectations.\nStryve may on occasion experience unanticipated increases in orders of its products from retailers that it may not yet have the manufacturing capacity or capabilities to fulfill on a timely basis. If Stryve cannot timely fill orders for its products, its reputation with these retailers may be harmed, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Any substantial delay in Stryve\u2019s plan to increase the production capacity or capabilities of the facility may hinder Stryve\u2019s ability to fill anticipated orders, grow its business or achieve profitability.\nFailure by transportation providers to deliver Stryve\u2019s products on time, or at all, could result in lost sales.\nStryve relies upon third-party transportation providers for its product shipments. The utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet shipping needs. Stryve could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries or could incur costs and expend resources in connection with a change or providers. Any significant delays in product shipments could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Stryve fails to cost-effectively acquire new customers or retain its existing customers or its consumers, or if it fails to derive revenue from its existing customers consistent with its historical performance, its business could be materially and adversely affected.\nStryve\u2019s success, and its ability to increase revenue and achieve profitably, depends in part on its ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers, to retain existing customers, and to keep existing consumers engaged so that they continue to purchase Stryve\u2019s products. If Stryve is unable to cost-effectively acquire new customers, retain existing customers or keep existing consumers engaged, its business, profitability, gross margins, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. If consumers do not perceive Stryve\u2019s product offerings to be healthy, of sufficient value and quality, or if it fails to offer new and relevant product offerings, it may not be able to attract or retain customers or engage existing consumers so that they continue to purchase products.\nStryve may not have or be able to generate sufficient cash to meet its current or future debt service obligations.\nStryve\u2019s ability to meet its current or future debt service obligations or to refinance its current or future debt, depends on its operating and financial performance, which will be affected by Stryve\u2019s ability to successfully implement its business strategy as well as general macroeconomic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. If Stryve cannot generate sufficient cash to meet its debt service requirements or if Stryve is unable to refinance its debt, Stryve may, among other things, need to delay planned capital expenditures or investments or sell material assets to meet those obligations.\nIf Stryve is not able to refinance any or all of its current or future debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets, including engaging in sale and leaseback transactions, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, it may not be able\nto satisfy its debt obligations. In that event, borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions with respect to other indebtedness may become payable on demand and Stryve may not have sufficient funds to repay all of its debts.\nStryve may face difficulties as it expands its operations into countries in which it has no prior operating experience.\nStryve may expand into countries other than the United States, such as less developed countries which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems. In addition, it may be difficult for Stryve to understand and accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in new geographic markets. It would be costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote Stryve\u2019s brands in international markets. If Stryve expands its business into new countries, it may encounter regulatory, legal, personnel, technological and other difficulties that increase its expenses and/or delay its ability to operate profitably in such countries, which may have a material adverse effect on its business and brand.\nGlobal, market and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nConcerns over inflation, geopolitical issues, global financial markets and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to periods of significant economic instability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, and diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward. Our general business may be adversely affected by any such economic instability or unpredictability. If these conditions worsen or do not improve, it may become more difficult for us to complete debt or equity financings which may be necessary for us to operate our business. Such financings may become more costly, difficult to complete, and more dilutive. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current suppliers or other partners could be negatively affected by global economic instability, which could adversely affect our ability to operate efficiently and complete our operational goals within the desired timeline.\nFurther, we face several risks associated with international business and are subject to global events beyond our control, including war, public health crises, including pandemics and epidemics, trade disputes, economic sanctions, trade wars, and their collateral impacts and other international events. There may be changes to our business if there is instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region, regardless of cause. For example, the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine may adversely impact our business. The sanctions announced by the U.S. and other countries following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine against Russia include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services, or technology in or from affected regions and travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected individuals and political, military, business and financial organizations in Russia. The U.S. and other countries could impose wider sanctions and take other actions should the conflict continue or escalate further.\nSuch sanctions and disruptions to the global economy may lead to additional inflation which may disrupt the global supply chain and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure supplies. Further, the conflict in Ukraine and related sanctions have led to increased oil prices. The increased cost of oil, along with increased or prolonged periods of inflation, would likely increase our costs in the form of higher wages, more expensive supplies and equipment necessary to operate our business, and increased costs of materials necessary for our operations.\nIt is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict or any future conflicts, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets, all of which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve may need additional capital and it may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nStryve may need to access additional capital to grow or finance its operations or acquisitions of other products or businesses. However, financing may not be available to Stryve on acceptable terms, or at all. Stryve\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to several factors, including market conditions, its operating performance and investor sentiment and any financial or operating covenants required. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unattractive, if available. If Stryve cannot generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital on a timely basis when needed, its growth or operations could be impeded.\nFailure to retain Stryve\u2019s senior management may adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve\u2019s success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of its senior management, including its Chief Executive Officer, Joe Oblas, and its Chief Financial Officer, Alex Hawkins. These executives have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of Stryve\u2019s business and for executing its growth strategy and are integral to its brand, culture and the reputation it enjoys with suppliers, distributors, customers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives could have a material adverse effect on Stryve\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, as it may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all.\nStryve intends to grow through acquisitions or joint ventures and it may not successfully integrate, operate or realize the anticipated benefits of such business combinations.\nStryve intends to pursue acquisitions or joint ventures involving products that complement its existing products, as well as brands in new categories and new geographies, to expand its business to include other nutritional snacks and potentially other food products. Stryve may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acquisitions of identified candidates on favorable terms, or integrate acquisitions it may complete.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase target prices and/or materially and adversely affect Stryve\u2019s ability to consummate transactions on favorable terms. These risks include the potential unavailability of financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions, the risk that Stryve overpays for an acquisition, the potential inability to identify all of the risks and liabilities inherent in a target company or assets notwithstanding diligence efforts, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of the business and additional strain on existing personnel, increased leverage resulting from any debt financing that may be required to complete an acquisition, and the need to obtain regulatory or other governmental approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions.\nAny acquisitions may pose risks associated with entry into new geographic markets, distribution channels, lines of business or product categories, where Stryve may not have significant prior experience. Potential acquisitions may entail significant transaction costs and require significant management time and distraction from its core business, even where it cannot consummate or decides not to pursue a particular transaction.\nIntegration of acquired entities can involve significant difficulties. These include the failure to achieve financial or operating objectives regarding an acquisition, systems, operational and managerial controls and procedures, the need to modify systems or to add management resources, difficulties in the integration and retention of consumers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies, amortization of acquired assets (which would reduce future reported earnings), possible adverse short-term effects on cash flows or operating results, integrating personnel with diverse backgrounds and organizational cultures, coordinating sales and marketing functions and retaining key personnel of an acquired business. Failure to manage these risks could have an adverse effect on Stryve\u2019s business.\nStryve relies upon Amazon, Shopify and other vendors to host and operate portions of its e-commerce business and platforms and any disruption of or interference with its use of these services would adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve outsources the hosting and operation of some of its e-commerce business and platforms to infrastructures like Amazon, Shopify and other vendors. Customers of Stryve\u2019s products need to be able to access these platforms and websites to shop, review our product offerings and prices and purchase its products. Some of its vendors run their own platform that Stryve accesses, and it is, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions. Stryve has experienced and expects that in the future it may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. Capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks.\nIf Stryve\u2019s customers are unable to purchase its products within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then Stryve\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In some instances, Stryve may not\nbe able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to its customers. Any of the above circumstances or events may possibly move customers to stop purchasing Stryve\u2019s products, impair its ability to increase revenue from existing customers, impair its ability to grow its customer base and otherwise harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve relies on information technology systems and any inadequacy, failure, interruption or security breaches of those systems may harm its ability to operate its business.\nStryve is dependent on various information technology systems, including, but not limited to, networks, applications and outsourced services in connection with the operation of its business. A failure of information technology systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt Stryve\u2019s business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and loss of sales, causing the business to suffer. In addition, Stryve\u2019s information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond its control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, viruses and security breaches. Any such damage or interruption could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA cybersecurity incident or other technology disruptions could negatively impact business, financial condition, results of operations and relationships with customers.\nStryve uses computers in substantially all aspects of its business operations, including direct sales through its e-commerce website. It also uses mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with employees, suppliers, distributors, customers and consumers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breaches, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Stryve\u2019s business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 information, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about it and its business partners. As Stryve pursues a strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve its operations and cost structure, it will also be expanding its reliance on information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If Stryve fails to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, it may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. While Stryve has implemented measures intended to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, its preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which it relies, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage all of which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the U.S. or worldwide economy may materially and adversely affect Stryve\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse and uncertain economic conditions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact distributor, retailer and consumer demand for Stryve\u2019s products. In addition, Stryve\u2019s ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its suppliers, distributors, retailers, consumers and creditors may suffer. Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns. Distributors and retailers may become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. Stryve\u2019s results of operations depend upon, among other things, its ability to maintain and increase sales volume with existing distributors and retailer customers, its ability to attract new consumers, the financial condition of its consumers, and its ability to provide products that appeal to consumers at attractive prices. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse effect on Stryve\u2019s sales and ability to achieve profitability, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve could be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations.\nStryve could be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations and changes in tax law could reduce its after-tax income and adversely affect its business and financial condition. For example, the U.S. federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), enacted in December 2017, resulted in fundamental changes to the Code, including, among many other things, a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate, a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, a limitation\non the deductibility of certain director and officer compensation expense, limitations on net operating loss carrybacks and carryovers and changes relating to the scope and timing of U.S. taxation on earnings from international business operations. Subsequent legislation, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) enacted on March 27, 2020, relaxed certain of the limitations imposed by the Tax Act for certain taxable years, including the limitation on the use and carryback of net operating losses and the limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense. The exact impact of the Tax Act and the CARES Act for future years is difficult to quantify, but these changes could materially affect us. In addition, other changes could be enacted in the future to increase the corporate tax rate, limit further the deductibility of interest, or effect other changes that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Such changes could also include increases in state taxes and other changes to state tax laws to replenish state and local government finances depleted by costs attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction in tax revenues due to the accompanying economic downturn.\nIn addition, Stryve\u2019s effective tax rate and tax liability are based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and treaties. These laws, regulations and treaties are complex and often open to interpretation. In the future, the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of laws, regulations and treaties, resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our effective tax rate. Changes to tax laws may also adversely affect Stryve\u2019s ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nStryve\u2019s only significant asset is its ownership interest in Holdings and such ownership may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable it to pay any dividends on its outstanding shares or to satisfy its other financial obligations, including any payments required to be made by Stryve under the Tax Receivables Agreement.\nStryve is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of Class A common units of Holdings. Stryve is not expected to have independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and its ability to pay its taxes, operating expenses (including expenses as a publicly traded company) and pay any dividends in the future will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of its subsidiaries.\nThe financial condition and operating requirements of Stryve's subsidiaries may limit its ability to obtain cash from Holdings. There can be no assurance that Stryve's subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to enable Holdings to distribute funds to Stryve or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants under debt instruments will permit such distributions. If Holdings does not distribute sufficient funds to Stryve to pay its taxes or other liabilities, Stryve may default on contractual obligations or have to borrow additional funds. In the event that Stryve is required to borrow additional funds, it could adversely affect its liquidity and subject it to additional restrictions imposed by lenders.\nStryve's subsidiary will be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is wholly owned by Holdings, which will be taxed as a partnership U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, both Holdings and Stryve's subsidiaries will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income and taxable loss of Holdings and Stryve's subsidiaries will be allocated by Holdings, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the holders of Units of Holdings. Under the terms of the Amended Holdings Operating Agreement, Holdings is obligated to make pro rata tax distributions to holders of Units of Holdings calculated at certain assumed rates. In addition to tax expenses, Stryve will also incur expenses related to its operations, including payment obligations under the Tax Receivables Agreement, which could be significant and some of which will be reimbursed (excluding payment obligations under the Tax Receivables Agreement). For so long as Stryve is the Managing Member (as defined in the Amended Holdings Operating Agreement) of Holdings, Stryve intends to cause Holdings to make ordinary distributions and tax distributions to the holders of Units of Holdings on a pro rata basis in amounts sufficient to enable Stryve to cover all applicable taxes, relevant operating expenses, payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement and dividends, if any, declared by Stryve. However, Holdings\u2019 ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, including, but not limited to, retention of amounts necessary to satisfy the obligations of Holdings and its subsidiaries and restrictions on distributions that would violate any applicable restrictions contained any debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering Holdings insolvent. To the extent Stryve is unable to make payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Additionally, nonpayment for a specified period and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivables Agreement and therefore accelerate payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement, which could be substantial.\nStryve anticipates that the distributions received from Holdings may, in certain periods, exceed its actual tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement. The Board, in its sole discretion, will make any determination from time to time with respect to the use of any such excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, to pay dividends on the Company's Class A common stock. Stryve will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to its shareholders.\nThe Tax Receivables Agreement requires Stryve to make cash payments to the TRA Holders in respect of certain tax benefits and such payments may be substantial. In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement may (i) exceed any actual tax benefits the Tax Group realizes or (ii) be accelerated.\nAt the Closing of the Business Combination, Stryve, Holdings and Seller entered into the Tax Receivables Agreement. Pursuant to the Tax Receivables Agreement, Stryve will generally be required to pay the TRA Holders 85% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign taxes that are based on, or measured with respect to, net income or profits, and any interest related thereto that the Tax Group realize, or are deemed to realize, as a result of certain Tax Attributes, which include:\n\u2022tax basis adjustments resulting from taxable exchanges of Holdings Class B common units and Class V common stock (including any such adjustments resulting from certain payments made by Stryve under the Tax Receivables Agreement) acquired by Stryve from a TRA Holder pursuant to the terms of the Amended Holdings Operating Agreement; and\n\u2022tax deductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the Tax Receivables Agreement (each of the foregoing, collectively, the \u201cTax Attributes\u201d).\nPayments under the Tax Receivables Agreement generally will be based on the tax reporting positions that Stryve determines (with the amount of subject payments determined in consultation with an advisory firm and subject to the review and consent of a representative of Stryve Foods Holdings, LLC), and the IRS or another taxing authority may challenge all or any part of a position taken with respect to Tax Attributes or the utilization thereof, as well as other tax positions that Stryve may take, and a court may sustain such a challenge. In the event that any Tax Attributes initially claimed or utilized by the Tax Group are disallowed, the TRA Holders will not be required to reimburse Stryve for any excess payments that may previously have been made pursuant to the Tax Receivables Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, any excess payments made to such TRA Holders will be applied against and reduce any future cash payments otherwise required to be made by us to the applicable TRA Holders under the Tax Receivables Agreement, after the determination of such excess. However, a challenge to any Tax Attributes initially claimed or utilized by the Tax Group may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, even if challenged earlier, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivables Agreement. As a result, there might not be future cash payments against which such excess can be applied, and Stryve could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement in excess of the Tax Group\u2019s actual savings in respect of the Tax Attributes.\nMoreover, the Tax Receivables Agreement will provide that, in certain early termination events, Stryve will be required to make a lump-sum cash payment to all the TRA Holders equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivables Agreement, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to there being sufficient future taxable income of the Tax Group to fully utilize the Tax Attributes over certain specified time periods and that all Class B common units of Holdings and Class V common stock that had not yet been exchanged for Class A common stock are deemed exchanged for cash. The lump-sum payment could be material and could materially exceed any actual tax benefits that the Tax Group realizes subsequent to such payment.\nPayments under the Tax Receivables Agreement will be Stryve's obligations and not obligations of Holdings. Any actual increase in Stryve's allocable share of Holdings and its relevant subsidiaries\u2019 tax basis in relevant assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the market price of the Class A common stock at the time of an exchange of Seller Consideration Units by a TRA Holder pursuant to the terms of the Amended Holdings Operating Agreement and the amount and timing of the recognition of the Tax Group\u2019s income for applicable tax purposes. While many of the factors that will determine the amount of payments that Stryve will be required to make under the Tax Receivables\nAgreement are outside of Stryve's control, Stryve expects that the aggregate payments it will be required to make under the Tax Receivables Agreement could be substantial and, if those payments substantially exceed the tax benefit Stryve realizes in a given year or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on its financial condition, which may be material.\nAny payments made by Stryve under the Tax Receivables Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to the Company. To the extent that Stryve is unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Additionally, nonpayment for a specified period and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivables Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivables Agreement. Furthermore, Stryve's future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement could make Stryve a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the Tax Attributes that may be deemed realized under the Tax Receivables Agreement.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe removal of USDA inspectors from Stryve\u2019s facility would materially adversely impact its business, financial condition and results of operations.t\nStryve has been granted a full grant of inspection with respect to its manufacturing facility in Oklahoma which allows Stryve to manufacture and produce its products. Stryve\u2019s operations at its Oklahoma facility require inspections conducted under the supervision of a USDA inspector and requires Stryve to meet certain regulatory requirements including but not limited to having a written Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan, sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and other regulatory requirements. If Stryve were to lose such grant of inspection, Stryve would be unable to operate its manufacturing facility in Oklahoma and the production of Stryve\u2019s products would cease immediately due to the prohibition of production under the Federal Meat Inspection Act of processing and distributing meat without federal inspection. Given the difficulty in procuring USDA inspection approval of biltong production, it is unlikely that Stryve could procure alternative production of its biltong products in a timely fashion. As a result, the loss of its grant of inspection would have an adverse effect on Stryve\u2019s sales and ability to achieve profitability, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve is subject to extensive government regulations and a failure to comply with such regulations could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve\u2019s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and by other federal, state, and local authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, transportation, distribution, and labeling of products that are manufactured, produced and processed by it. Specifically, Stryve is subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA and the Federal Meat Inspection Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the USDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling and safety of food and food ingredients. Under this regulatory program, the FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements, including hazard analysis and preventative controls regulations, current good manufacturing practices, or GMPs, and supplier verification requirements. Stryve\u2019s processing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities and if Stryve cannot manufacture products that conform to the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, USDA or others, it may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which could materially impact its ability to market its products or could result in a recall of a product that has already been distributed. The USDA has also issued strict regulations concerning the control of listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products and contamination by food borne pathogens such as E. coli and salmonella and implemented a system of regulation known as the HACCP program. The HACCP program requires all meat processing plants to develop and implement sanitary operating procedures and other program requirements. OSHA oversees safety compliance and establishes certain employer responsibilities to help \u201cassure safe and healthful working conditions\u201d and keep the workplace free of recognized hazards or practices likely to cause death or serious injury.\nIf a regulatory authority determines that Stryve has not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, it could be subject to fines or lose its ability to process meat, which materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Stryve chooses to expand internationally, it will be subject to international regulations that could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve will be subject to extensive regulations internationally where it manufactures, distributes and/or sells its products. Currently, Stryve sells its products into Canada and Mexico and may expand to additional countries. Stryve\u2019s products are subject to numerous food safety and other laws and regulations relating to the sourcing, manufacturing, storing, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of these products. If Stryve fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, it could be subject to civil remedies or penalties, such as fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions. In addition, enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment could limit Stryve\u2019s business activities, increase its operating costs, reduce demand for its products or result in litigation.\nElements of Stryve\u2019s business, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, health and safety practices, transportation and use of many of Stryve\u2019s products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, and the laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which Stryve\u2019s products or components thereof, such as packaging, may be made, manufactured or sold. These laws, regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, because of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such factors may include changes in:\n\u2022food and drug laws (including FDA and USDA regulations) including those relating to manufacturing of ready to eat meat products;\n\u2022laws related to product labeling;\n\u2022advertising and marketing laws and practices;\n\u2022laws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain products;\n\u2022laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients present in certain products;\n\u2022laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption of products or ingredients or altering the package or portion size of certain products;\n\u2022state consumer protection and disclosure laws;\n\u2022taxation requirements, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the sale of certain products;\n\u2022competition laws;\n\u2022anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d);\n\u2022economic sanctions and anti-boycott laws, including laws administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and the sanctions imposed on Russia due to its recent invasion of Ukraine;\n\u2022laws relating to export, re-export, transfer, tariffs and import controls, including the Export Administration Regulations, the EU Dual Use Regulation and the customs and import laws administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection;\n\u2022employment laws;\n\u2022privacy laws; and\n\u2022farming and environmental laws.\nNew laws, regulations or governmental policies and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes, tariffs or other limitations on the sale of Stryve\u2019s products, ingredients in its products or commodities used in the production of its products, may alter the environment in which it does business and, therefore, may affect its operating results or increase its costs or liabilities.\nLegal claims, government investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject Stryve to civil and criminal penalties.\nStryve operates in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. Consequently, Stryve is subject to heightened risk of legal claims, government investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions. Although Stryve has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that its employees, temporary workers, contractors or agents will not violate its policies and procedures. Moreover, a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Legal claims, government investigations or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of Stryve\u2019s failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect Stryve\u2019s product sales, reputation, financial condition and operating results; including a cessation of operations at Stryve\u2019s manufacturing facility. In addition, the costs and other effects of defending potential and pending litigation and administrative actions may be difficult to determine and could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFood safety and food-borne illness incidents or advertising or product mislabeling may materially adversely affect Stryve\u2019s business by exposing it to lawsuits, product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing its operating costs and reducing demand for its product offerings.\nSelling food for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, and there is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death related to allergens, food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents caused by products Stryve sells, or involving its suppliers, could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or its relationships with such suppliers, or otherwise result in increased operating costs, regulatory enforcement actions or harm to its reputation. Shipment of adulterated or misbranded products, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could also expose Stryve to product liability, negligence or other lawsuits, including consumer class action lawsuits. Any claims brought against Stryve may exceed or be outside the scope of its insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against Stryve that is more than its policy limits or not covered by its policies or not subject to insurance would have to be paid from cash reserves, which would reduce is capital resources.\nThe occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs, disruptions in supply and a reduction in sales. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination or regulatory noncompliance, whether or not caused by Stryve\u2019s actions, could compel Stryve, its suppliers, distributors or customers, depending on the circumstances, to conduct a recall in accordance with FDA and/or USDA regulations, and comparable state laws. Food recalls could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time and potential loss of existing distributors or customers and a potential negative impact on the ability to attract new customers due to negative consumer experiences or because of an adverse impact on Stryve\u2019s brand and reputation. The costs of a recall could exceed or be outside the scope of Stryve\u2019s insurance policy coverage or limits.\nIn addition, food companies have been subject to targeted, large-scale tampering as well as to opportunistic, individual product tampering, and Stryve, like any food company, could be a target for product tampering. Forms of tampering could include the introduction of foreign material, chemical contaminants and pathological organisms into consumer products as well as product substitution. Recently issued FDA regulations will require companies like Stryve to analyze, prepare and implement mitigation strategies specifically to address tampering designed to inflict widespread public health harm. If Stryve does not adequately address the possibility, or any actual instance, of product tampering, it could face possible seizure or recall of its products and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nStryve may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to its business.\nStryve\u2019s ability to compete effectively depends in part upon protection of its rights in trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and other intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Stryve\u2019s use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights may be inadequate. Stryve may not be able to preclude third parties from using its intellectual property rights with respect to its products, its processes with respect to the air-drying of its meat products in a manner satisfactory to the USDA and other regulators, and may not be able to leverage its branding beyond its current product offerings. In addition, Stryve\u2019s trademark or other intellectual property applications may not always be granted. Third parties may oppose Stryve\u2019s intellectual property applications, or otherwise challenge its use of its trademarks or other intellectual property. Third parties may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate Stryve\u2019s intellectual property, and changes in applicable laws could serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections available for its intellectual property. Any legal action that Stryve may bring to protect its brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Any litigation or claims brought against Stryve, for trademark infringement or related matters, even without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of its resources. A successful claim of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or other violation against Stryve could prevent it from providing its products or services, or could require it, if it is unable to license such third-party intellectual property on reasonable terms, to redesign or rebrand its products or product packaging. Any of the foregoing results could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Stryve Being a Public Company\nStryve has not previously been managed as a public company and its current resources and management personnel may not be sufficient to fulfill its public company obligations.\nFollowing the Business Combination, Stryve is subject to various regulatory requirements, including those of the SEC and Nasdaq. These requirements include record keeping, financial reporting and corporate governance rules and regulations. Stryve\u2019s internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support its increased reporting obligations, and it may be unable to hire, train or retain necessary staff and may be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome its lack of experience or employees. The post-combination business could be adversely affected if Stryve\u2019s internal infrastructure is inadequate, if it is unable to engage outside consultants or if it is otherwise unable to fulfill its public company obligations.\nStryve will incur significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and its management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance efforts.\nStryve will incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company. The Dodd-Frank Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules implemented by the SEC, impose substantial burdens related to corporate governance practices of public companies. Stryve expects that compliance with these and other similar laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, will substantially increase its expenses, including Stryve\u2019s legal and accounting costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these laws, rules and regulations to have made it more expensive for Stryve to obtain director and officer liability insurance. A substantial\nincrease in Stryve\u2019s legal, accounting, insurance and certain other expenses in the future will negatively impact its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf Stryve does not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, it could fail to report its financial results accurately.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for Stryve to provide reliable financial reports. Stryve may discover areas of its internal control over financial reporting that need improvement. Stryve has not historically documented its internal controls, and if in the future Stryve identifies a control deficiency that rises to the level of a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting, this material weakness may adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and, as a result, its financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If Stryve fails to properly and efficiently maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, it could fail to report its financial results accurately.\nRisks Related to Our Securities Generally\nThe price for our securities has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\nFluctuations in the price of Stryve\u2019s securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. The trading price of Stryve\u2019s securities has been volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond its control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in Stryve\u2019s securities and its securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of Stryve\u2019s securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar\n\u2022changes in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022success of competitors;\n\u2022operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the industries in which we operate in general;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis, including the continued appeal and reputations of celebrity endorsers;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022the volume of shares of Class A common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022any major change in our Board or management;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant shareholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022general economic and political conditions such as recessions, pandemics, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for the stock of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and can lead to stockholder litigation.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur securities are currently listed on the Nasdaq. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u2022a determination that shares of our Class A common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares;\n\u2022a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u2022a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our Class A common stock and Warrants are listed on Nasdaq, our securities are covered securities. If we are no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which our securities are offered.\nDelaware Law and the Charter contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nThe Charter and the DGCL contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by the Board, and therefore depress the trading price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the current members of the Board or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in management. Among other things, the Charter and the Bylaws include provisions regarding:\n\u2022a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of the Company Board;\n\u2022the ability of the Company Board to issue shares of preferred stock, including \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022the limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, the Company\u2019s directors and officers;\n\u2022the right of the Company Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Company Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Company Board;\n\u2022the requirement that directors may only be removed from the Company Board for cause;\n\u2022the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the Company Board, the chairman of the Company Board or the Company\u2019s chief executive officer, which could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of the Company Board and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of 66 2/3% of the voting power of the outstanding voting capital stock of the Company, voting together as a single class to amend, alter, change or repeal certain provisions in the Charter and the Bylaws, respectively, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in the Company Board and also may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022the ability of the Company Board to amend the Bylaws, which may allow the Company Board to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the Bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to the Company Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in the Company Board and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company;\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in the Company Board or management.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, the Company is generally subject to provisions of Delaware law, including the DGCL. Although the Company elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, certain provisions of the Charter do, in a manner substantially similar to Section 203 of the DGCL, prohibit certain Company stockholders (other than those stockholders who are party to a stockholders\u2019 agreement with the Company) who hold 15% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combination transactions with the Company for a specified period of time unless certain conditions are met.\nAny provision of the Charter, the Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for the Company\u2019s common stock.\nProvisions in the Charter and Delaware law may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against the directors and officers of the Company.\nThe Charter requires that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Charter or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject\nto such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims under the Exchange Act, but will apply to other state and federal law claims including actions arising under the Securities Act. Section 22 of the Securities Act, however, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.\nAlthough we believe this provision will benefit the Company by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against the Company\u2019s directors and officers.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose Stryve to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on its reputation or business.\nThe per share price of the Class A common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities litigation, including class action litigation. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, from time to time, Stryve may be party to other various claims and litigation proceedings. Stryve evaluates these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, it may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from its assessments and estimates.\nOn March 29, 2022, one of the investors in Stryve\u2019s January 2022 private offering sent the Company a letter alleging that the Company has breached \u201cthe representations and warranties the Company\u201d made to investors in the definitive agreement. Although Stryve intends to vigorously defend itself against these allegations, Stryve cannot at this time predict whether any litigation will be filed, predict the likely outcome of any future litigation, reasonably determine either the probability of a material adverse result or any estimated range of potential exposure, or reasonably determine how this matter or any future matters might impact our business, our financial condition, or our results of operations, although such impact, including the costs of defense, as well as any judgements or indemnification obligations, among other things, could be materially adverse to us.\nLawsuits may divert Stryve\u2019s management\u2019s attention, and Stryve may incur significant expenses in defending any lawsuits. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in any legal dispute may result in monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief, which could have a material adverse effect on Stryve\u2019s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage Stryve\u2019s reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance. Furthermore, while Stryve maintains insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions, as well as limits on amounts recoverable.\nOur management\u2019s ability to require holders of our redeemable Warrants to exercise such redeemable Warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of Class A commons stock upon their exercise of the redeemable Warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their redeemable Warrants for cash.\nIf we call Warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria described elsewhere herein have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his Warrants (including any Warrants held by our initial shareholders or their permitted transferees) to do so on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of Class A common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his Warrants for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in the Company.\nThe terms of the Warrants may be amended in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Warrants.\nThe Warrants were issued in registered form pursuant to a warrant agreement (the \u201cWarrant Agreement\u201d) between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Warrant Agent, and us. The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The Warrant Agreement requires the approval by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Warrants (including the Private Warrants) in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, the terms of the Warrants may be amended in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Warrants approve of such amendment. We may amend the terms of the Warrants with the consent of at least a majority of the then outstanding Warrants to effect any change thereto, including to increase the exercise price of the Warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares purchasable upon exercise of a Warrant.\nThe Warrants may not be in the money at the time they become exercisable, and they may expire worthless.\nThe exercise price for the outstanding Warrants is $11.50 per share. There can be no assurance that the Warrants will be in the money following the time they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, and as such, the Warrants may expire worthless.\nOur Private Warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of our Warrants could have a material effect on our future financial results.\nOn April 12, 2021, the Acting Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Acting Chief Accountant of the SEC together issued a statement regarding the accounting and reporting considerations for Warrants issued by special purpose acquisition companies entitled \u201cStaff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (\u201cSPACs\u201d)\u201d (the \u201cSEC Statement\u201d). As a result of the SEC Statement, the Company reevaluated the accounting treatment and determined to classify the Private Warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjusts the Warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company\u2019s statement of operations. As a result of the recurring fair value measurement, our financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly and such fluctuations are outside of our control. We expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our Private Warrants each reporting period and those amounts could be material.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act and have taken advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies; this could make the Company\u2019s securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare the Company\u2019s performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are not applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on certain executive compensation matters. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We may remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which our total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30 and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period, meaning that the occurrence of one or more of the aforementioned events or circumstances could cause our loss of that status prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of our IPO. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the securities less attractive as a result of reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of the securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act\nregistration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period. Accordingly, when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard, unless early adoption is permitted by the standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nConflicts of interest may arise between the Company\u2019s management and holders of shares of Class A common stock and/or the Company.\nBecause members of the Company\u2019s senior management team will hold most or all of their economic interest in the Company through ownership of Class B common units of Holdings (and corresponding shares of Class A common stock), they may have interests that will not align with, or conflict with, those of the holders of Class A common stock or with the Company. For example, members of the Company\u2019s senior management team may have different tax positions from those of the Company and/or holders of Class A common stock, which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to enter into certain transactions or dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when the Company should terminate the Tax Receivables Agreement and accelerate the obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions and investments may take into consideration tax considerations applicable to holders of the Class B common units of Holdings even where no similar benefit would accrue to the Company and the holders of the Class A common stock.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 18461, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "ANDA"}
