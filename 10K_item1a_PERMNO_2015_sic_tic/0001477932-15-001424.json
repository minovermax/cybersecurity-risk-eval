Risk factors\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business, important risk factors that may affect us are discussed below. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive. Many competitors in this industry are well-established, do a substantially greater amount of business, and have greater financial resources and facilities than we do.\nDomestically, we believe we rank third in the number of units sold in the field of electrosurgical generator manufacturing and we sell our products and compete with other manufacturers in various ways. In addition to advertising, attending trade shows and supporting our distribution channels, we strive to enhance product quality and functionality, improve user friendliness, and expand product exposure.\nWe have also invested, and continue to invest, substantial resources to develop and monetize, our J-Plasma technology. If we are unable to gain acceptance in the marketplace of J-Plasma, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. From June of 2010 through December 31, 2014, we have invested approximately $5.5 million in the development and marketing of our J-Plasma technology.\nWe also compete by private labeling our products for major distributors under their label. This allows us to increase our position in the marketplace and thereby compete from two different approaches, our Aaron or Bovie label, and our customers\u2019 private label. Our private label customers distribute our products under their name through their internal sales force. We believe our main competitors do not private label their products.\nLastly, at this time we sell the majority of our products through distributors. Many of the companies we compete with sell direct, thus competing directly with distributors they sometimes use.\nOur industry is highly regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and international regulatory authorities, as well as other governmental, state and federal agencies which have substantial authority to establish criteria which must be complied with in order for us to continue in operation.\nUnited States\nOur products and research and development activities are subject to regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the following activities:\n\u00b7\nProduct development\n\u00b7\nProduct testing\n\u00b7\nProduct labeling\n\u00b7\nProduct storage\n\u00b7\nPre-market clearance or approval\n\u00b7\nAdvertising and promotion\n\u00b7\nProduct traceability, and\n\u00b7\nProduct indications.\nIn the United States, medical devices are classified on the basis of control deemed necessary to reasonably ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices are subject to general controls. These controls include registration and listing, labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to the FDA Quality System Regulation. Class II devices are subject to general and special controls. Special controls include performance standards, post market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidelines. Class III devices are those which must receive pre-market approval by the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Currently, we only manufacture Class I and Class II devices. Pre-market notification clearance must be obtained for some Class I and most Class II devices when the FDA does not require pre-market approval. All of our products have been cleared by, or are exempt from, the pre-market notification process.\nA pre-market approval application is required for most Class III devices. A pre-market approval application must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device. The pre-market approval application typically includes:\n\u00b7\nResults of bench and laboratory tests, animal studies, and clinical studies\n\u00b7\nA complete description of the device and its components; and\n\u00b7\nA detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling.\nThe pre-market approval process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy. A number of devices for which pre-market approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing.\nInternational Regulation\nTo market products in the European Union, our products must bear the \u201cCE\u201d mark. Manufacturers of medical devices bearing the CE mark have gone through a conformity assessment process that assures that products are manufactured in compliance with a recognized quality system and to comply with the European Medical Devices Directive.\nEach device that bears a CE mark has an associated technical documentation that includes a description of the following:\n\u00b7\nDescription of the device and its components,\n\u00b7\nA summary of how the device complies with the essential requirements of the medical devices directive,\n\u00b7\nSafety (risk assessment) and performance of the device,\n\u00b7\nClinical evaluations with respect to the device,\n\u00b7\nMethods, facilities and quality controls used to manufacture the device, and\n\u00b7\nProposed labeling for the device.\nManufacturing and distribution of a device is subject to ongoing surveillance by the appropriate regulatory body to ensure continued compliance with quality system and reporting requirements.\nWe began CE marking of devices for sale in the European Union in 1999. In addition to the requirement to CE mark, each member country of the European Union maintains the right to impose additional regulatory requirements.\nOutside of the European Union, regulations vary significantly from country to country. The time required to obtain approval to market products may be longer or shorter than that required in the United States or the European Union. Certain European countries outside of the European Union do recognize and give effect to the CE mark certification. We are permitted to market and sell our products in those countries.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with competitive advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our research and development efforts rely upon investments and alliances, and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or alliances will be successful.\nOur research and development activities are an essential component of our efforts to develop new and innovative products for introduction in the marketplace. New and improved products play a critical role in our sales growth. We continue to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products, such as our J-Plasma technology, and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines. We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and areas of development. Our research and development activities are primarily conducted internally and are expensed as incurred. These expenses include direct expenses for wages, materials and services associated with the development of our products net of any reimbursements from customers. Research and development expenses do not include any portion of general and administrative expenses. Our Clearwater, Florida facility has been our flagship research and design location. We expect to continue making future investments to enable us to develop and market new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing business. However, we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments will be successful or that our new products such as J-Plasma, will gain market acceptance, the failure of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe amount expended by us on research and development of our products during the years 2014, 2013, and 2012, totaled approximately $1.4, $1.3, and $1.3 million respectively. During the past three years, we invested substantial resources in the development and marketing of our J-Plasma technology, including the ICON GS plasma system, Endoscopic Modular Instruments and accompanying new generators. We have not incurred any direct costs relating to environmental regulations or requirements. For 2015, we expect the amount of our expenditures for research and development activities to remain similar to the level in 2014.\nEven if we are successful in developing and obtaining approval for our new product candidates, there are various circumstances that could prevent the successful commercialization of the products.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend on a number of factors, any of which could delay or prevent commercialization, including:\n\u25cf\nthe regulatory approvals of our new products are delayed or we are required to conduct further research and development of our products prior to receiving regulatory approval;\n\u25cf\nwe are unable to build a sales and marketing group to successfully launch and sell our new products;\n\u25cf\nwe are unable to raise the additional funds needed to successfully develop and commercialize our products or acquire additional products for growth;\n\u25cf\nwe are required to allocate available funds to litigation matters;\n\u25cf\nwe are unable to manufacture the quantity of product needed in accordance with current good manufacturing practices to meet market demand, or at all;\n\u25cf\nour product is determined to be ineffective or unsafe following approval and is removed from the market or we are required to perform additional research and development to further prove the safety and effectiveness of the product before re-entry into the market;\n\u25cf\ncompetition from other products or technologies prevents or reduces market acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf\nwe do not have and cannot obtain the intellectual property rights needed to manufacture or market our products without infringing on another company\u2019s patents; or\n\u25cf\nwe are unsuccessful in defending against patent infringement or other intellectual property rights, claims that could be brought against us, our products or technologies;\nThe failure to successfully acquire or develop and commercialize new products will have a material and adverse effect on the future growth of our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to foreign currency fluctuations and other risks associated with operating in foreign countries.\nWe operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. To date, we have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and as a result, we are subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses. We purchase goods and services in U.S. dollars and Euros. Foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by satisfying foreign denominated expenditures with cash flows or assets denominated in the same currency therefore we are subject to some foreign currency fluctuation risk. Our currency value fluctuations were not material for 2014.\nOur operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by healthcare reform legislation.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in March 2010. Among other initiatives, this legislation imposes a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of class I, II, and III medical devices beginning in 2013. Substantially all of our products are class I or class II medical devices. In 2014 and 2013 we paid medical device excise tax of approximately $435,926 and $384,438, respectively. As approximately 84% of our 2014 sales were derived in the U.S. we cannot predict if any additional regulations will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally.\nOur operations may experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of changes in prices for oil, gasoline, and other commodities.\nWe use some plastics and other petroleum-based materials along with precious metals contained in electronic components as raw materials in many of our products. Prices of oil and gasoline also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. Oil, gasoline and precious metal prices are volatile and may increase, resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost-containment efforts of our customers we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset through other cost reductions, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Clearwater, Florida and could be affected due to multiple risks from fire, hurricanes, physical changes in the planet due to climate change, and similar phenomena.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Clearwater, Florida and could be affected by multiple weather risks, most notably hurricanes. Although we carry property and casualty insurance and business interruption insurance, future possible disruptions of operations or damage to property, plant and equipment due to hurricanes or other weather risks could result in impaired production and affect our ability to meet our commitments to our customers and impair important business relationships, the loss of which could adversely affect our operations and profitability. We do however maintain a backup generator at our Clearwater facility and a disaster recovery plan is in place to help mitigate this risk.\nWe do not produce hazardous materials or emissions that would adversely impact the environment. We do however, have air conditioning units and consume electricity which could be impacted by climate change in the form of increased rates. However, we do not believe the increase in expense from any rate increases, as a percentage of sales, would be material in the near term.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have historically done a substantial amount of business with seven of our top ten customers, who are also major distributors of our product, which as a group have produced substantial revenues for our Company. Loss of business from a major customer will likely materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe manufacture the majority of our products on our premises in Clearwater, Florida. Labor-intensive sub-assemblies and labor-intensive products may be out-sourced to our specification. Although we sell through distributors, we market our products through national trade journal advertising, direct mail, distributor sales representatives and trade shows, under the Bovie name, the Bovie/Aaron name and private label. Major distributors include Cardinal Health, Independent Medical Co-Op Inc. (IMCO), McKesson Medical Surgical, Inc., Medline, National Distribution and Contracting Inc. (NDC), Owens & Minor, and Physician Sales & Service (PSS) now a division of McKesson. If any of these distributor relationships are terminated or not replaced, our revenue from the territories served by these distributors could be adversely affected.\nWe are also dependent on OEM customers who have no legal obligation to purchase products from us. Should such customers fail to give us purchase orders for the product after development, our future business and value of related assets could be negatively affected. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that such customers will give sufficient high priority to our products. Finally, disagreements or disputes may arise between us and our customers, which could adversely affect production and sales of our products.\nWe rely on certain suppliers and manufacturers for raw materials and other products and are vulnerable to fluctuations in the availability and price of such products and services.\nFluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of the raw materials we use in our manufacturing could have a negative effect on our cost of sales and our ability to meet the demands of our customers. Inability to meet the demands of our customers could result in the loss of future sales. In addition, the costs to manufacture our products depend in part on the market prices of the raw materials used to produce them. We may not be able to pass along to our customers all or a portion of our higher costs of raw materials due to competitive and marketing pressures, which could decrease our earnings and profitability.\nWe also have collaborative arrangements with four key foreign suppliers under which we request the development of certain items and components and we purchase them pursuant to purchase orders. Our purchase order commitments are never more than one year in duration and are supported by our sales forecasts. The majority of our raw materials are purchased from sole-source suppliers. While we believe we could ultimately procure other sources for these components, should we experience any significant disruptions in this key supply chain, there are no assurances that we could do so in a timely manner which could render us unable to meet the demands of our customers, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results. Over the past few years we have expanded the use of our Bulgarian supplier who manufactures a substantial number of our generator and accessory components. We anticipate expanding this relationship further to include manufacturing a large number of our J-Plasma components.\nIf we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.\nWe own 23 patents and 9 registered trademarks in the U.S. and have had 13 patents issued outside the U.S. with some of our early patents nearing the expiration of their patent term. Of those 23 patents, 15 are related to J-Plasma, with 8 issued and 7 pending. We also have several U.S. and international patent applications pending for various new products. We intend to continue to seek legal protection, primarily through patents, for our proprietary technology. Seeking patent protection is a lengthy and costly process, and there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any pending applications, or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be sufficiently broad or strong to protect our proprietary technology. There is also no guarantee that any patents we hold will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the patent rights granted will provide competitive advantages to us. Our competitors have developed and may continue to develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. In addition, the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nAdverse outcomes in current or future legal disputes regarding patent and other intellectual property rights could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights, subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties on terms that may not be reasonable or favorable to us, prevent us from manufacturing, importing or selling our products, or compel us to redesign our products to avoid infringing third parties\u2019 intellectual property. As a result, our product offerings may be delayed, and we may be unable to meet customers\u2019 requirements in a timely manner. Regardless of the merit of any related legal proceeding, we have incurred in the past and may be required to incur in the future substantial costs to prosecute, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. Even in the absence of infringement by our products of third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, or litigation related to trade secrets, we have elected in the past and may in the future elect to enter into settlements to avoid the costs and risks of protracted litigation and the diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention. However, if the terms of settlements entered into with certain of our competitors are not observed or enforced, we may suffer further costs and risks. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and resources or results of operations.\nOur ability to develop intellectual property depends in large part on hiring, retaining and motivating highly qualified design and engineering staff with the knowledge and technical competence to advance our technology and productivity goals. To protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, generally we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees, as well as with consultants and other parties. If these agreements prove inadequate or are breached, our remedies may not be sufficient to cover our losses.\nWe have been and may in the future become subject to litigation proceedings that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOther Litigation\nIn addition to the litigation risks and proceedings mentioned below, we have recently been involved and may in the future become subject to legal claims or proceedings related to securities, employment, customer or third party contracts, environmental regulations, or other matters. The costs involved in defending these claims have been substantial, which have had an adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, if other claims are asserted against us, we may be required to defend against such claims, or deem it necessary or advisable to initiate a legal proceeding to protect our rights, the expense and distraction of such a claim or proceeding, whether or not resolved in our favor, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Further, if a claim or proceeding were resolved against us or if we were to settle any such dispute, we may be required to pay damages and costs or refrain from certain activities, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIntellectual Property Litigation or Trade Secrets\nWe have in the past, experienced certain allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights and use of trade secrets and may receive other such claims, with or without merit, in the future. Previously, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights have sometimes evolved into litigation against us, and they may continue to do so in the future. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of litigation. Although we believe we have had adequate defenses to these claims and that the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, there can be no assurances that we will prevail. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us, significantly reduce our cash resources, and create a diversion of the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to successfully defend against such claims, we could be prohibited from future sales of the allegedly infringing product or products, which could materially and adversely affect our future growth.\nProduct Liability Litigation\nAlthough we carry liability insurance, due to the nature of our products and their use by professionals, we may, from time to time, be subject to litigation from persons who sustain injury during medical procedures in hospitals, physician\u2019s offices or in clinics and defending such litigation is expensive, disruptive, time consuming and could adversely affect our business. We currently maintain product liability insurance with combined coverage limits of $10 million on a claims-made basis. There is no assurance that this coverage will be adequate to protect us from any possible liabilities (individually or in the aggregate) we might incur in connection with the sale or testing of our products. In addition, we may need increased product liability coverage as additional products are commercialized. This insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur business is subject to the potential for defects or failures associated with our products which could lead to recalls or safety alerts and negative publicity.\nManufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, off-label uses or inadequate disclosure of product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. These problems could lead to a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products and result in significant costs and negative publicity. Due to the strong name recognition of our brands, an adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future. In some circumstances, adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of our current regulatory reviews of our applications for new product approvals. We also may undertake voluntarily to recall products or temporarily shut down certain production lines based on internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data. Any of the foregoing problems could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur impairments to our long-lived assets.\nWe review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Additionally, if in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than the book value of our assets, this could also indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. We operate in highly competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment to a long-lived intangible asset, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT Market under the ticker symbol \u201cBVX.\u201d The market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and announcements by us or by third parties may have a significant impact on our stock price. These announcements may include:\n\u25cf\nour listing status on the NYSE MKT Market;\n\u25cf\nour operating results falling below the expectations of public market analysts and investors;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our relationships with or developments affecting our major customers;\n\u25cf\nnegative regulatory action or regulatory non-approval with respect to our new products;\n\u25cf\ngovernment regulation, governmental investigations, or audits related to us or to our products;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments related to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in the position of securities analysts with respect to our stock.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for the medical technology sector companies, and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nHistorically, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. The lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nIn addition, future sales by existing stockholders, warrant holders receiving shares upon the exercise of warrants, or any new stockholders receiving our shares in any financing transaction may lower the price of our common stock, which could result in losses to our stockholders. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the possibility of such sales occurring, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock or our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities. Substantially all of our common stock is freely tradable in the public market without restriction under the Securities Act, unless these shares are held by our \u201caffiliates\u201d, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock and, even if we change that policy, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance operations and invest in our business. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant.\nIf we change that policy and commence paying dividends, we will not be obligated to continue paying those dividends and our stockholders will not be guaranteed, or have contractual or other rights, to receive dividends. If we commence paying dividends in the future, our board of directors may decide, in its discretion, at any time, to decrease the amount of dividends, otherwise modify or repeal the dividend policy or discontinue entirely the payment of dividends. Under the Delaware law, our board of directors may not authorize the payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of our statutory surplus.\nThe low trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect the price of our shares and their liquidity.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT exchange, our common stock has experienced low trading volume. Limited trading volume may subject our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for investors to sell shares at a price that is attractive to them.\nWe may in the future seek to raise funds through equity offerings, which could have a dilutive effect on our common stock.\nIn the future we may determine to raise capital through offerings of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock or rights to acquire these securities or our common stock. For instance, we are authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 3,500,000 shares have been designated as Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock. To facilitate a potential capital raise, we filed a shelf-registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2014, although there is no guarantee we will utilize such registration statement. The result of sales of such securities, or the conversion of the Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock, the exercise of warrants issued in connection with such offering or the triggering of anti-dilution provisions in such securities would ultimately be dilutive to our common stock by increasing the number of shares outstanding. We cannot predict the effect this dilution may have on the price of our common stock. In addition, the shares of preferred stock may have rights which are senior or superior to those of the common stock, such as rights relating to voting, the payment of dividends, redemption or liquidation.\nExercise of warrants and options issued by us will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the warrants issued by us in April 2010 were exercisable for up to approximately 672,858 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 3.8% of our then outstanding common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the warrants issued by us in December 2013 were exercisable for up to approximately 5,746,875 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 32% of our then outstanding common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our outstanding stock options to our employees, officers, directors and consultants amounted to approximately 2,864,189 shares of our common stock, representing approximately an additional 16% of our then outstanding common stock.\nThe exercise of some or all of our warrants and stock options will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89891, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "APYX"}
