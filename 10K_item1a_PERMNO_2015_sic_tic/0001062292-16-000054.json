{"cik": "1062292", "company": "XO GROUP INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. In addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered before purchasing shares of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur operating results may fluctuate, are difficult to predict and could fall below expectations.\nOur operating and financial results have fluctuated significantly on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe level of online usage and traffic on our digital properties;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of advertisers;\n\u2022\nthe advertising budgeting cycles of specific advertisers;\n\u2022\nthe regional and national magazines\u2019 publishing cycles;\n\u2022\nthe transition of portions of our business to a marketplace model, and the speed with which our consumers and vendors transition to that marketplace;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations, including those related to acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new sites and services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, as well as economic conditions specific to the Internet, online and offline media and transactions.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to meet rapidly changing advertiser, vendor and consumer demands for content, products and user engagement in a timely manner, if at all, even if we are successful in enhancing and upgrading our digital properties (including our websites and mobile properties) in response to advances in technology and evolving preferences. If the number of visitors to our digital properties stagnates or declines, we may not be able to create or maintain sufficient advertiser or vendor interest in our digital platforms. Even if we are successful in driving consumer traffic to our digital properties, advertisers and vendors are sensitive to general economic conditions and reductions in consumer spending, among other events and trends, which could result in lower transactions revenue and reduced advertising expenditures, particularly from national advertisers. We cannot assure you that our current advertisers will fulfill their obligations under existing contracts, continue to advertise beyond the terms of existing contracts or enter into any additional contracts with us. Our advertising and other revenue could also decline as a result of pricing pressures on digital advertising rates due to industry developments, such as the fragmentation of digital media. If we are unable to effectively monetize our digital properties, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nHistorically, we have not consistently generated income. We incur a significant percentage of our expenses, such as employee compensation, prior to generating revenues associated with those expenses. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectation of future revenues. We may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall. If we have a shortfall in revenue or if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly, then our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and, as a result, we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. We cannot assure you that we can achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Failure to achieve or maintain profitability may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock.\nDue to the foregoing or other factors, it is also possible that our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of investors and/or securities analysts. We also experience some seasonal trends that may produce variations in quarterly results and financial conditions. To the extent there are significant fluctuations in our financial results, the trading price of our common stock could decline materially. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance.\nOur transactions business is dependent on third party participants, whose lack of performance could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA growing portion of our revenue is from transactions. Our transactions revenue is dependent on third parties\u2019 participation in our transactions programs, and the success of those partners and vendors. We are dependent on our retail partners to manage competitive pressures, and to the extent they are unable to do so, we may experience lower revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Such businesses are also dependent on our partners keeping their respective websites and other digital properties operational, as well as on the visitors who use those sites. Any decline in traffic or technical difficulties experienced by these websites or mobile devices may negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe fulfillment and delivery of products purchased by customers are processed and delivered by our third party partners. As a result, we are dependent on our partners to manage inventory, process orders and distribute products to our customers in a timely manner. We also rely on information provided by these partners to update and integrate information daily. If our partners experience problems with customer fulfillment or inventory management, or if we cannot integrate our processes with those of our partners, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\nIn addition, our partners are highly dependent on the health of the U.S. or foreign economies and many are further dependent on local economic conditions in the states or countries in which they primarily conduct their businesses. Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence that negatively impacts our partners\u2019 businesses could result in lower revenue to our business, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing business and/or fail to generate the results we are expecting.\nWe have invested in, and expect to continue to invest in, new businesses, products, services and technologies. We cannot be certain that our products, services and digital properties will appeal to, and garner acceptance from, the public or our advertisers and other third party partners. We expect to continue to increase our operating expense growth in excess of historic rates in the near future to launch new products or upgrade existing products. We may not be able to successfully leverage our audience share or brand positioning to create and maintain use of our new products and services. Moreover, even if new features and services prove to be commercially successful, they may reduce usage of our existing features and services. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from new services and features to gain a return on our investments, or if our revenue from existing services declines as a direct result of a shift in consumer usage to new services, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nResearching and developing, launching, gaining acceptance of and establishing profitability for a new or expanded product, service or digital property, or assimilating and marketing an acquired product, is both risky and costly. New products generally incur initial operating losses. Such costs are generally expensed as incurred and, accordingly, our profitability from year to year may be adversely affected by the number, timing, and ultimate success of the launches of new products, services and digital properties. Other businesses and brands that we may develop also may not prove successful. Resources deployed on new technology or products could reduce our ability to grow and/or generate revenue from existing sources.\nCapital expenditures required for upgrades to our systems may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to secure the technology talent to complete these upgrades. Moreover, oversight of these upgrades will consume significant attention from our management, which could hamper our ability to run our business. If our new technology and features are not successful, we may not be able to scale our digital properties or react to a changing competitive landscape. As a result, the value and recognition of our brands, as well as our financial condition and prospects, could be materially and adversely affected.\nMore people are using mobile phones and other wireless devices to access the Internet, and if we are unable to develop solutions that generate revenue from advertising and other services delivered to such devices, our business could be harmed.\nOur content was originally designed for users accessing the Internet on a desktop computer. The number of people who access the Internet through devices other than computers, including mobile phones and handheld computers such as notebooks and tablets, and who use mobile payment and transaction services, has increased substantially in recent years and is expected to continue to grow. A significant and growing portion of users access our digital platforms through mobile devices. To date, we have not been able to generate revenue from our advertising and other services delivered to mobile devices as effectively as we have for our advertising and other services on traditional computers. In the absence of effective mobile advertising and other service solutions, we may be unable to attract and retain customers for advertisers or other services. If we are unable to implement successful\nmonetization strategies for mobile users, or if we incur excessive expenses in our effort to do so, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur businesses could be negatively affected by changes in Internet search engine algorithms.\nWe depend in part on various Internet search engines (such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!) to direct traffic to our websites and properties. Similarly, we depend on distribution relationships with high-traffic digital properties, such as those operated by Microsoft\u2019s MSN and Yahoo!, to promote our websites and properties. Our ability to maintain the number of potential customers directed to our websites and properties is not entirely within our control. For example, search engines often revise their algorithms in an attempt to improve the search results presented to their users. Our ability to influence the search engine rankings of our websites and properties, through our search engine optimization efforts or otherwise, is limited. In addition, we cannot assure you that our distribution relationships with high-traffic digital properties will yield additional users or that such relationships will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Changes by Internet search engines in their algorithms, or changes to competitive dynamics that affect our distribution relationships in a negative manner, could cause our websites and properties to receive less user traffic. Fewer potential customers could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition in our markets. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Internet and mobile advertising markets, online markets and publishing markets in which our brands operate are intensely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. For example, our brands face competition for members, users, readers and advertisers from the following areas:\n\u2022\nstand-alone online services, websites, mobile applications or blogs targeted at brides and grooms, such as those offered by Weddingbee, WeddingWire, and MyWedding.com, and at new parents, such as Johnson & Johnson\u2019s BabyCenter and others;\n\u2022\nonline and brick and mortar retail stores, manufacturers and regional directories;\n\u2022\nwedding sub-domains, channels or niche sites of major online destinations or portals, such as Google and AOL\u2019s Huffington Post;\n\u2022\nbridal magazines and their online destinations, such as Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s Brides, and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia\u2019s Martha Stewart Weddings;\n\u2022\nparenting magazines and their online destinations; and\n\u2022\nonline and retail stores offering gift registries, especially from retailers offering specific gift registries.\nWe expect competition to increase because of the business opportunities presented by the growth of the Internet and transaction-based marketplaces. Our competition may also intensify as a result of industry consolidation and a lack of substantial barriers to entry. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources, greater name recognition and substantially larger user bases than we have and, therefore, have significant ability to attract advertisers, vendors and users. In addition, many of our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in digital user requirements, as well as devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of services.\nMarketplaces compete in two-sided markets, and must attract both consumers and vendors in order to be successful. Consumers who might use our marketplaces to buy goods or services have a wide variety of alternatives, including traditional department, warehouse, boutique, discount and general merchandise stores (as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers), online retailers and their related mobile offerings, online and offline classified services and other shopping channels. In addition, consumers have a large number of online and offline channels focused on one or more of the categories of products and services offered on our site. Consumers and vendors who might use our sites to sell goods or services also have many alternatives, including general online ecommerce sites, and more specialized sites, such as websites operated by bridal gown designers, wedding hall venues, destination wedding resorts, etc. Vendors who use our marketplace may also choose to sell their goods and services through other channels.\nThe principal competitive factors for marketplaces like ours include the following:\n\u2022\nability to attract, retain and engage consumers and vendors, as well as maintain user engagement;\n\u2022\nvolume of transactions and price and selection of products and services;\n\u2022\ntrust in the vendor and the transaction;\n\u2022\ncustomer service (both that provided by us and that provided by the vendors in our marketplace);\n\u2022\nbrand recognition;\n\u2022\nwebsite, mobile platform and application ease-of-use and accessibility;\n\u2022\nsystem reliability;\n\u2022\nlevel of service fees; and\n\u2022\nease of use and quality of search tools.\nWe cannot assure you that our current or potential competitors will not develop services and products comparable or superior to those that we develop or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies, evolving industry trends or changing Internet user preferences. Increased competition could result in price reductions, lower margins or loss of market share, any of which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nWe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\nWe may be subject to claims for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, personal injury or other legal theories relating to the information we publish, display or distribute. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services, as well as other print publications in the past. We could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our online sites through links to other online sites or through content and materials that may be posted by members in message bulletin boards. Our insurance, which covers commercial general liability, may not adequately protect us against these types of claims.\nThe laws that shield online service providers such as us from liability for the activities of users of their online services are often challenged in the United States and internationally. We may be unable to prevent users of our services from providing negligent, unlawful or inappropriate advice, information or content via our services, or from behaving in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for negligent, fraudulent, unlawful or inappropriate activities carried out by users of our services. Claims could be made against online services companies under both United States and foreign law such as fraud, defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, data breach, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated by users of our services. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that could prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the Internet of certain types of information. Our defense of any of these actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.\nThe listing or sale by our vendors of unlawful, counterfeit or stolen goods or unlawful services, or sale of goods or services in an unlawful manner, may result in allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities against us involving activities carried out by vendors through our marketplace. Allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights, including but not limited to counterfeit items, have resulted in threatened and actual litigation from time to time by rights owners against the operators of other marketplaces. Plaintiffs in these and similar suits seek, among other remedies, injunctive relief and damages. Statutory damages for copyright or trademark violations could range up to $150,000 per copyright violation and $2,000,000 per trademark violation in the United States, and may be even higher in other jurisdictions.\nIf we become liable for information provided by our users and carried via our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business. In addition, negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our services could damage our reputation, reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users, and diminish the value of our brand.\nIn the future, we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings, either of which could harm our business. Any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the sale of unlawful services or the unlawful sale of services could harm our business.\nConsumers may sue us if any of the products that our retail or other partners sell online or otherwise make available are defective, fail to perform properly or injure the user. Liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. As a result, any such claims, whether or not successful, could seriously damage our financial results, reputation and brand name.\nFraudulent or unlawful activities on our marketplace could harm our business, and could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our marketplace.\nThe law relating to the liability of marketplace operators is currently unsettled. We face risks with respect to fraudulent activities on our marketplace and periodically receive complaints from consumers who may not have received the goods or services that they had contracted to purchase. We may also incur losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from consumer fraud, from erroneous transmissions and from consumers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments they are obligated to make. Although we have implemented measures to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activities, combat bad consumer experiences and increase customer satisfaction, including evaluating vendors on the basis of their transaction history and restricting or suspending their activity where appropriate, we cannot assure you that these measures will be effective in combating fraudulent transactions or improving overall satisfaction among consumers and other participants. Additional measures to address fraud could negatively affect the attractiveness of our marketplace to consumers or vendors, resulting in a reduction in the ability to attract new consumers or vendors or retain current consumers or vendors, damage to our reputation, or a diminution in the value of our brand names. We also may be unable to prevent vendors on our marketplace from selling unlawful goods or services, or selling goods or services in an unlawful manner, and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our vendors.\nWe are subject to payments-related risks.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer\u2019s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. As we offer new payment options to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks\u2019 costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, our reputation, our brand name, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure you that our publications will be profitable.\nWe generate significant revenue from our magazine publishing business. Preserving circulation is critical for maintaining advertising sales. Magazines face increasing competition from alternative forms of media and entertainment. As a result, sales of magazines through subscriptions and at the newsstand could decline, which may lead to a reduction in expenditures for magazine advertising and suppressed advertising rates. Many of our bridal publishing competitors have closed or reduced the frequency of their publications. Advertisers may choose not to reallocate their spending to other publications, or may choose to spend it in other media, and we cannot assure you that our publications will receive any benefit from these closures. In fact, we may face increased competition from the remaining bridal publications in this market. If circulation of our magazines decreases or if advertisers decide to spend less money or advertise elsewhere in lieu of our magazines, our business and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our business.\nOur brands have contributed significantly to the success of our business. Building and maintaining the brand recognition of The Knot, The Bump and The Nest and our other brands is critical to attracting and expanding our base of online users and offline readership, advertisers, corporate customers and other partners, and increasing their engagement with our services, and will depend largely on our ability to maintain member trust, be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality solutions, which we may not do successfully. Our brands may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including the reputation of our content and products and our ability to adapt to technological changes. Despite our efforts to protect and prevent misuse of our brands, if others misuse our brands or pass themselves off as being endorsed or affiliated with us, it could harm our reputation, and our business could suffer. Our brands are also important in attracting and maintaining highly qualified employees. If we fail to build\nor maintain awareness of our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we cannot protect our domain names, we may not be able to promote our brands successfully.\nWe currently hold various web domain names, including TheKnot.com, TheBump.com, and TheNest.com, that are critical to the operation of our business and the promotion of our brands. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names, or Internet addresses, is generally regulated by governmental agencies and their designees and by trademark and other laws. The regulations governing domain names could change in ways that block or interfere with our ability to use relevant domains. Also, we might not be able to prevent third parties from registering or retaining domain names that interfere with our consumer communications, or infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Recently, regulatory bodies have approved expanded generic top-level domain names, which involves substantial costs and may lead to an increase in cybersquatting. Regulatory bodies also may establish additional generic or country-code top-level domains or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names in all countries in which we conduct business, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brands.\nWe rely on copyright, trademark, patent and other intellectual property laws to protect our rights in our proprietary technology, processes, designs, content and other intellectual property to the extent such protection is sought or secured at all. We also depend on trade secret protection through, among other things, confidentiality agreements and/or invention assignment agreements with our employees, licensees and others, as well as through license agreements with our licensees and other partners. We may not have agreements containing adequate protective provisions in every case, and the contractual provisions that are in place may not provide us with adequate protection in all circumstances. In addition, the steps we might otherwise take may not be adequate to protect against infringement and misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties. As an example, we may be unable to secure patent or other intellectual property rights broad or strong enough to protect the underlying proprietary technology.\nThe duration of the protection afforded to our intellectual property depends on the type of property in question, the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and the terms of its license agreements with others. With respect to our trademarks and trade names, trademark laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and limited to those countries where a mark has been registered or protected. While trademark registrations may generally be maintained in effect for as long as the mark is in use in the respective jurisdictions, there may be occasions where a mark or title is not registrable or protectable or cannot be used in a particular country. In addition, a trademark registration may be cancelled or invalidated if challenged by others based on certain use requirements or other limited grounds.\nIntellectual property laws afford us only limited protection. A third party may be able to develop similar or superior technology, processes, content or other intellectual property independently. In addition, monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, including our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and patents, is difficult. Third parties may register marks that are confusingly similar to the trademarks or services marks that we have used in the United States and our failure to monitor foreign registrations or mark usage may impact our rights in certain trademarks or services marks. Judicial decisions, legislation, and other patent and intellectual property reform efforts could also undermine the validity, scope, and enforceability of our patent and intellectual property holdings. The unauthorized reproduction or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it, diminish the value of our brands, competitive advantages or goodwill and result in decreased sales. If this occurs, our business and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nDisputes concerning the ownership of our rights to use intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming to litigate, may distract management from other tasks of operating the business and may result in our loss of significant rights and the loss of our ability to operate our business. Litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.\nIn addition, other parties may assert infringement claims against us or claim that we have violated a patent or infringed a copyright, trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them, whether on our own or by virtue of our use of certain third-party technology. If we are subject to claims of infringement or are infringing the rights of third parties, we may not be able to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we might need to undertake substantial reengineering to continue our online offerings. Any effort to undertake such reengineering might not be successful, resulting in a failure to continue to provide our services or sell our products. Furthermore, a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. An injunction or other court order could prevent us from operating products or our business. Any claim of infringement, even if the claim is invalid or without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending\nagainst the claim, distract our management from our business, require us to pay substantial damage awards, prevent us from selling our products, require the development of non-infringing software, technology, business processes, systems or other intellectual property (none of which might be successful), limit our ability to use the intellectual property that is the subject of any of these claims, unless we enter into license agreements with the third parties (which may be costly, unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or not available at all), be time-consuming, result in costly settlements, litigation or restrictions on our business and damage our reputation. Therefore, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition, we have not obtained copyright and trademark protection for all of our proprietary technology, processes, content and brands in all of the countries where we sell our products or otherwise operate. This could leave us helpless to stop potential infringers or possibly even unable to sell our products or provide our services in certain territories.\nWe may need to rely on third-party license agreements for patents and other technology related to our products and services, and the failure to secure such agreements could delay or prevent us from being able to commercialize our products and services.\nIn the future, we might need to license third-party software to enhance our products and services and meet evolving customer requirements. These licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Some of this technology could be difficult to replace once integrated. The loss of, or inability to obtain, these licenses could result in delays or reductions of our applications until we identify, license and integrate or develop equivalent software, and new licenses could require us to pay higher royalties. If we are unable to successfully license and integrate third party technology, we could experience a reduction in functionality and/or errors or failures of our products or services, which may reduce demand for our products and services. Third-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology, the impact of new technology integration on our existing technology, open source software disclosure risks, the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology, and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nSystem disruptions, failures, or breaches in of our systems or our third-party service providers, including those resulting from cyber-attacks, security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\nThe continuing, uninterrupted and secure performance of our computer systems is critical to our success. While we continue to expand our focus on this issue and are taking safeguarding measures, we are vulnerable to the increasing risk of cyber-attacks and other security incidents, such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Because the techniques used in cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated in ways that avoid detection, we or our service providers may not be able to anticipate, prevent, identify or adequately remediate such incidents. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or our third party service providers to disclose information in order to gain access to our data. A cyber-attack or other security incident involving our or our service providers\u2019 systems may result in unauthorized access, loss, or other compromise to, among other things, our data, including trade secrets, our customers\u2019 data, billing data such as credit or debit card information, and any other data that is confidential or subject to applicable domestic or foreign privacy or security laws or regulations. If we suffer a cyber-attack or other security incident due to third party or employee conduct, we could be subject to lawsuits, regulatory investigations, increased costs associated with regulatory compliance and systems remediation, investigations and fines by payment card companies, harm to our brand and reputation, disruption in our ability to provide our services, any of which could reduce revenue, increase costs, and materially harm our business and results of operations. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover any claims by dissatisfied advertisers or customers and may not be adequate to indemnify us for any costs or liability that may be imposed on us as a result of any system disruptions, failures, cyber-attacks, security breaches or other compromise or to our ability to provide various services to our customers and users.\nOur business depends on third-party service providers who support important aspects of our various services.\nIf any of our service providers fail to provide reliable and secure software, systems and services to us, we would need to pursue alternative sources of services, and while alternatives are available, we may be unable to secure such services on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us. Our advertisers, users and members may become dissatisfied by any systems disruption, failure, cyber-attacks or security incidents that interrupt our ability to provide services and content to them in a timely or secure manner whether it involves our systems or those of our service providers. Substantial or repeated system disruptions, prolonged failures or delays, or significant cyber-attacks or security incidents, would reduce the attractiveness of our online sites and services. All of the forgoing could result in increased costs to us, decreased demand for our websites and services, damage to our reputation and customer relationships, and expose us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.\nWe currently face a myriad of U.S. federal and state statutory and regulatory rules regarding the collection, use, transfer, and retention of personal information and other data privacy and security issues. These laws and regulations continue to be in a state of flux and are expanding. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even if we don\u2019t have a local entity, employees or infrastructure. In general, foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are more restrictive than those in the United States. As in the U.S., the substance and applicability of such laws in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions are subject to continued development and interpretation by agencies and courts. For example, the European Union and many countries within the European Union have adopted and are developing data privacy protection and security directives relating to the collection, use, storage and transfer of data that are more stringent than in the United States. In addition, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in our rapidly-evolving industry, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.\nThe cost of compliance with any applicable laws could be material, and we may not be able to comply with them in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all. Compliance with any applicable laws could also delay or impede the development of new products or services, result in negative publicity and damage to our brand an reputation, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or subject us to inquiries or investigations, claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices. In addition, changes to existing laws or the passage of new laws could create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, privacy concerns in general may cause visitors to avoid online sites like ours that collect and use information, for purposes such as behavioral targeted advertising, and even the perception of privacy or security concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market acceptance of our services. In addition, if our privacy practices are deemed unacceptable by watchdog groups or privacy advocates, such groups may attempt to harm our business by blocking access to our sites or disparaging our reputation and our business and may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may also be subject to claims of liability or responsibility for the actions of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely in relation to various services, including but not limited to vendors and business partners. These third parties may be vulnerable to privacy violations, and threats, such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts to access, modify or delete our or our customers' information or business assets that they service or maintain on our behalf. The foregoing could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism or computer viruses.\nOur business operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins earthquakes, fires, floods, and similar events. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, data and reputation, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the economy as a whole. Our principal executive offices are located in New York City, a region that has experienced acts of terrorism in the past. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer data. Although we have disaster recovery capabilities, we cannot assure you that we will not suffer from business interruption as a result of any such events, and any such event could also result in large expenditures necessary to repair or replace such networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. As we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality service to our customers, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business, result in loss of existing or potential customers and increased maintenance costs, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on our personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nCompetition for personnel in the digital, mobile and media industries is intense. We may be unable to retain employees who are important to the success of our business, in particular, members of our senior management team. We may also face difficulties attracting, integrating or retaining other highly qualified employees in the future. Any loss or interruption of the services of one\nor more of our key personnel or our inability to attract new personnel could result in us being unable to manage our operations effectively and/or to pursue our business strategy.\nWe depend on our management team. Loss of any key member of that team may prevent us from executing our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur success depends largely upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key personnel, including senior creative, technical, operational and finance executives. If our management team, including any new hires, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, or if we fail to successfully integrate newly-hired executives or senior managers, our business could be harmed. We cannot assure you that if we were to experience a high degree of management change in the future, we would be able to replace departing members of management in a timely manner or successfully integrate newly-hired executives or senior managers.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are not able to integrate any future acquisitions successfully or operate successfully under our strategic partnerships.\nIn the past, we have completed numerous acquisitions and investments in other companies, as well as strategic partnerships. In the future, we may acquire, or invest in, complementary companies, products or technologies or enter into new strategic partnerships. Acquisitions, investments and partnerships involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating operations, technologies, products and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\noperating under commercial agreements entered into by an acquisition target;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering new markets;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees; and\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs.\nTo pay for an acquisition or to enter into a strategic alliance, we might use equity securities, debt, cash, or a combination of the foregoing. If we use equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Any such acquisitions or strategic alliances may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nImpairment charges related to assets may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have several investments and intangible assets that, depending upon competitive and economic conditions, could become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In the past we have recorded charges against our earnings for amortization of intangibles with a definite life, as well as impairment charges on certain intangible assets with indefinite lives and investments, and we may be required to take other charges, including write-downs of significant amounts, in the future. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by such charges.\nOur effective tax rate is subject to significant fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in states where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in states where we have higher statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. These fluctuations in our effective tax rate, including the impact of adverse outcomes from tax audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties related to doing business online, and may become subject to more burdensome regulations and oversight.\nLaws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications, privacy, cybersecurity, and transactions and advertising continue to become more prevalent. Laws and regulations may be adopted covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, unsolicited commercial e-mail (spam), content, taxation, quality of services and products, consumer protection, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Any new legislation could hinder the growth in use of the Internet and other online services generally and decrease the acceptance of the Internet and other online services as media for communications, transactions and advertising. In addition, the laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled, even in areas where legislation has been enacted. Whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel\nand taxation apply to the Internet and digital advertising and transactional services is still being determined. The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet and other online services could cause our advertising revenue and transactions revenue to decline and our business and prospects to suffer.\nRegulators and industry groups have also released self-regulatory principles and guidelines for various data privacy and security practices. Interpretation of these laws and guidelines and their application to online services in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions is ongoing, and cannot be fully determined at this time. These principles and guidelines could be interpreted or applied in a manner that is not consistent with our current business practices, which could cause significant negative publicity, require us to incur substantial compliance costs, and subject us to inquiries or investigations, claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices, and otherwise materially affect our business. It is also possible that new laws or regulations may be adopted, which could harm our business.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that, although our U.S. assets and transmissions currently originate in New York, the governments of other states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our business, services, transmissions, data collection or levy sales, or other taxes, or impose other requirements or restrictions relating to our activities. The uncertain nature of existing and proposed rules and regulations around the world could substantially impair the growth of transactions, seriously harm our profitability, and result in our inability to enforce contracts or otherwise run our business.\nWe could face additional regulatory requirements, tax liabilities and other risks related to our continuing operations in China and Hong Kong, and other markets outside the United States where we may commence operations.\nWe have continuing operations in China and Hong Kong. There are risks related to doing business in international markets in general, such as:\n\u2022\ndifferent user preferences and requirements in specific international markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing our current and future foreign operations;\n\u2022\nchallenges caused by language, cultural differences and by doing business with foreign agencies and governments;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements and uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including data privacy and cybersecurity issues;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nstringent local labor laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\ncredit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest or economic instability; and\n\u2022\nseasonal volatility in business activity.\nOne or more of these factors could harm our current or future international operations.\nIn addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business and could interfere with our ability to offer, or prevent us from offering, our products and services to one or more countries or expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy and security requirements, restrictions on the collection and use of consumer data, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to address these laws, we cannot assure you that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies or any applicable laws or regulations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our ability to expand our international operations, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our results of operations, and could expose us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations.\nIn addition to the risks associated with our continuing operations in China and Hong Kong, on December 30, 2014, we completed the disposition of our Ijie operations; while we experienced cost savings as a result of this disposition, any benefits we receive may be offset by contingent liabilities or additional tax obligations associated with this disposition. For example, if third parties seek to hold us responsible for the liabilities of the Ijie operations, or if any disputes arise between us and the purchasers of the Ijie operations, our business could be harmed.\nIt is possible that we may not be able to obtain additional financing necessary to execute our business strategy.\nWe currently believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. Our ability to meet our obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent upon our ability to maintain profitable operations and/or raise additional financing through public or private equity or debt financings, or other arrangements with corporate sources or other sources of financing to fund operations. However, there is no assurance that we will maintain profitable operations or that additional funding, if required, will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been, and will likely continue to be, highly volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations.\nIn the recent past, the equity trading markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant periods of volatility, resulting in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Our common stock has experienced significant volume and price fluctuations in the past. Our current market price and valuation may not be sustainable. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your common stock at or above your purchase price. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation. If we were to become the subject of securities class action litigation, we could face substantial costs and be negatively affected by diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly, including a decline below your purchase price, in the future. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock, or the perception that these shares might be sold, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the past, we have filed shelf registration statements with the SEC covering re-sales of shares of our common stock by institutional investors who purchased our shares in private placements. Certain future holders of our common stock may be granted rights to participate in, or require us to file, registration statements for re-sales of common stock, and we may complete public offerings of shares or issue shares pursuant to acquisitions that are freely tradable.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or vesting of restricted stock), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could deter takeover attempts, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. We may issue shares of preferred stock in the future without stockholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine. Our issuance of this preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding stock and potentially prevent the payment of a premium to stockholders in an acquisition. In addition, our certificate of incorporation includes provisions giving the board the exclusive right to fill all board vacancies, providing for a classified board of directors and permitting removal of directors only for cause and with a super-majority vote of the stockholders.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, and may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors\ncould rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. This could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or may otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control from us, either of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock in the past.\nIn the past, we have retained all earnings and other cash resources for the future operation and development of our business. Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account many factors, including our results of operations, financial conditions, current and anticipated cash needs and plans for expansion. Accordingly, if we do not declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the future, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may not occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nOur executive officers and directors, and stockholders that owned greater than 5% of our common stock, exercise significant control over all matters requiring a stockholder vote.\nAs of March 1, 2016, our executive officers and directors, and stockholders that owned greater than 5% of our common stock, and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 24.1% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, if some or all of these parties act as a group, they would be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.", "PERMNO": 87496, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "XOXO"}
