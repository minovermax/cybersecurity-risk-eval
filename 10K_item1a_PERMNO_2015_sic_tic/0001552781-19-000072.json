{"cik": "870385", "company": "CAROLINA FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to certain risks, including those described below. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. More detailed information concerning these risks is contained in other sections of this report, including \u201cPart I, Item 1: Business\u201d and \u201cPart II, Item 7: Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business may be adversely affected by economic conditions.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the primary markets where we operate and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. While economic conditions in our local markets in South Carolina and North Carolina have improved since the end of the economic recession, concerns still exist over the federal deficit, government spending, and economic risks. A return of recessionary conditions or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate value and sales volumes and high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve, in an attempt to help the overall economy, has among other things, kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Reserve increased the target range by 25 basis points each on December 15, 2016, March 16, 2017, June 15, 2017 and December 14, 2017. During 2018, the rate was increased by 25 basis points on March 21, June 13, September 26 and December 19. The potential for further gradual increases in the federal funds rate depends on the economic outlook. As the federal funds rate increases, market interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures, or other securities or financial arrangements, give LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and other interest rates. In the event that a published LIBOR rate is unavailable after 2021, the value of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities could be adversely affected. Currently, the manner and impact of this transition and related developments, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, securities portfolio and business, is uncertain.\nOur mortgage banking profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to originate and resell a high volume of mortgage loans.\nMortgage production, especially refinancing activity, typically declines in a rising interest rate environment. Because we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking business depends in large part upon our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon (i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) our ability to profitably sell loans or securities into that market. As our level of mortgage production declines, the profitability from our mortgage operations will depend upon our ability to reduce our costs commensurate with the reduction of revenue from our mortgage operations.\nOur ability to originate and sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by the government sponsored entities, or GSEs, and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Because the largest participants in the secondary market are government-sponsored enterprises whose activities are governed by federal law, any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of the GSEs could, in turn, adversely affect our operations. In September 2008, the GSEs were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. Although to date the conservatorship has not had a significant or adverse effect on our operations, it remains unclear whether these events or further changes would significantly and adversely affect our operations. The government and others have provided options to reform the GSEs, but the results of any such reform, and their impact on us, are difficult to predict. To date, no reform proposal has been enacted. In addition, our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the programs offered by the GSEs and other institutional and non-institutional investors. Our ability to remain eligible to originate and securitize government insured loans may also depend on having an acceptable peer-relative delinquency ratio for FHA loans and maintaining a delinquency rate with respect to Ginnie Mae pools that are below Ginnie Mae guidelines.\nAny significant impairment of our eligibility with any of the GSEs would materially adversely affect our operations. Further, the criteria for loans to be accepted under such programs may be changed from time-to-time by the sponsoring entity which could result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations. The profitability of participating in specific programs may vary depending on a number of factors, including our administrative costs of originating and purchasing qualifying loans and our costs of meeting such criteria.\nAn increase in our nonperforming assets would adversely impact our earnings.\nOur nonperforming assets may increase in future periods. Nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or investments or on real estate owned. We must establish an allowance for loan losses that reserves for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable through current period provisions for loan losses, which are recorded as a charge to income. From time to time, we also write down the other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to the other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from our overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities.\nWe could record other-than-temporary impairment on our securities portfolio. In addition, we may not receive full future interest payments on these securities.\nWe review our investment securities portfolio at least quarterly and more frequently when economic conditions warrant, assessing whether there is any indication of other-than-temporary impairment, or (\u201cOTTI\u201d). Factors considered in the review include estimated future cash flows, length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospect of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the security to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. If the review determines that there is OTTI, then an impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the investment\u2019s cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made, or a portion may be recognized in other comprehensive income. The fair value of investments on which OTTI is recognized then becomes the new cost basis of the investment.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had 214 individual securities available-for-sale in an unrealized loss position. The Company believes, based on OTTI evaluations, that the deterioration in the value of these securities is attributable primarily to changes in interest rates. There are three additional trust preferred securities classified as available-for-sale securities that had OTTI expense recorded in prior years, but did not incur OTTI expense during fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. Management believes that there are no other securities other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2018. The Company does not intend to sell these securities, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost. Management continues to monitor these securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that the Company will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of the securities may be sold or are other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require a charge to earnings in such periods.\nA number of factors or combinations of factors could require us to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss that exists with respect to our securities portfolio constitutes additional impairment that is other than temporary, which could result in material losses to us. These factors include, but are not limited to, a continued failure by an issuer to make scheduled interest payments, an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security, an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions and/or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value. In addition, the fair values of securities could decline if the overall economy and the financial condition of some of the issuers continue to deteriorate and there remains limited liquidity for these securities.\nWe may not be able to continue to support the realization of our deferred tax asset.\nWe calculate income taxes in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. In accordance with this, we regularly assess available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset balances will be recovered from reversals of deferred tax liabilities, potential utilization of net operating loss carrybacks, tax planning strategies and future taxable income. At December 31, 2018, our net deferred tax asset was $5.8 million. We recognized the deferred tax asset because management believes, based on earnings and detailed financial projections, that it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient future earnings to utilize this asset to offset future income tax liabilities. Realization of a deferred tax asset requires us to apply significant judgment and is inherently speculative because it requires the future occurrence of circumstances that cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that we will achieve sufficient future taxable income as the basis for the ultimate realization of our deferred tax asset and therefore we may have to establish a full or partial valuation allowance at some point in the future. If we determine that a valuation allowance is necessary, this would require us to incur a charge to operations that would adversely affect our capital position. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to recognize any, or all, of the deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes.\nWe may be terminated as a servicer of mortgage loans, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions.\n\t\nWe act as servicer for approximately $4.0 billion of mortgage loans owned by third parties as of December 31, 2018. As a servicer for those loans we have certain contractual obligations, including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination as servicer if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing income.\nIn some cases, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims that we did not satisfy our obligations as a servicer, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a significant reduction to net servicing income within our mortgage banking noninterest income. We may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower and/or to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the required process was not followed. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us. In addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action are missing or defective, we could be obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the loan. We may incur liability to securitization investors relating to delays or deficiencies in our processing of mortgage assignments or other documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosures. The fair value of our mortgage servicing rights may be negatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure costs. We may be subject to fines and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our foreclosure practices or in the foreclosure practices of other mortgage loan servicers. Any of these actions may harm our reputation or negatively affect our home lending or servicing business.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances, which could harm liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the government sponsored enterprises, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnification of buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. With respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels, the remedies available against the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not be as broad as the remedies available to purchasers, guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against us. We face further risk that the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not have financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available. Therefore, if a purchaser, guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur decisions regarding credit risk and reserves for loan losses may materially and adversely affect our business.\nMaking loans and other extensions of credit is an essential element of our business. Although we seek to mitigate risks inherent in lending by adhering to specific underwriting practices, our loans and other extensions of credit may not be repaid. The risk of nonpayment is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the duration of the credit;\n\u00b7 credit risks of a particular customer;\n\u00b7 changes in economic and industry conditions; and\n\u00b7 in the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nWe attempt to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses to provide for potential losses in our loan portfolio. We periodically determine the amount of the allowance based on consideration of several factors, including:\n\u00b7 an ongoing review of the quality, mix, and size of our overall loan portfolio;\n\u00b7 our historical loan loss experience;\n\u00b7 evaluation of economic conditions;\n\u00b7 regular reviews of loan delinquencies and loan portfolio quality; and\n\u00b7 the amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing the loans.\nThere is no precise method of predicting credit losses; therefore, we face the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed our allowance for loan losses and that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will be required. Additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of our net income, and possibly our capital.\nManagement uses available information to recognize losses on loans and foreclosed real estate. However, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in local economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and foreclosed real estate. It is possible that the allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed real estate may change materially in the near term.\nWe may have higher loan losses than we have allowed for in our allowance for loan losses.\nLike all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses caused by customer loan defaults. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and in this case additional and larger provisions for loan losses would be required to replenish the allowance. Provisions for loan losses are a direct charge against income.\nWe establish the amount of the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss rates, as well as estimates and assumptions about future events. Because of the extensive use of estimates and assumptions, our actual loan losses could differ, possibly significantly, from our estimate. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable losses, but it is possible that the allowance for loan losses will need to be increased for credit reasons or that regulators will require us to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A weakening of the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected. Acts of nature, including hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, fires and floods, which could be exacerbated by potential climate change and may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans, may also negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe have a concentration of credit exposure in commercial real estate and challenges faced by the commercial real estate market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.0 billion in loans outstanding to borrowers whereby the collateral securing the loan was commercial real estate, representing approximately 40.9% of our total loans outstanding as of that date. Approximately 29.7%, or $298.7 million, of this real estate are owner-occupied properties. Commercial real estate loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions, and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default. Because our loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in our level of nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the related provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement more stringent underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures.\nRepayment of our commercial business loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.\nAt December 31, 2018, commercial business loans comprised 14.2% of our total loan portfolio. Our commercial business loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow and general liquidity of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower and/or repayment capacity of any guarantor. The borrower\u2019s cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectable and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use. In addition, business assets may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Accordingly, the repayment of commercial business loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit worthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral value provided by the borrower and liquidity of the guarantor.\nFurther downturns or a slower recovery in the real estate markets in our primary market areas could significantly adversely impact our business.\nOur primary market areas are the Coastal, Midlands, and Upstate regions of South Carolina, including the Charleston (Charleston, Dorchester and Berkeley Counties), Myrtle Beach (Horry and Georgetown Counties), Columbia (Richland and Lexington Counties), and the Upstate (Greenville and Spartanburg Counties) market areas. Our primary market areas in North Carolina include Wilmington (New Hanover County), Raleigh-Durham (Durham and Wake Counties) and the surrounding southeastern coastal region of North Carolina (Bladen, Brunswick, Columbus, Cumberland, Duplin and Robeson Counties).\nThe Company\u2019s primary markets are heavily influenced the military, the medical industry, national and international industries, tourism, retirement living, retail and real estate. If economic conditions were to deteriorate in these markets, the industries in our markets could suffer, which could impact our business. The real estate markets experienced a significant decline in these markets in recent years and, if these economic drivers were to experience further downturns or recover more slowly than expected, real estate in the Company\u2019s markets may experience further declines. If real estate values in our markets decline, the collateral for these loans will provide less security. As a result, the borrower\u2019s ability to pay, or the Company\u2019s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying collateral, would be diminished.\nOur focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase our credit risk.\nMost of our commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate negatively impact this important customer sector, our results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by us in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of our borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition for customers, which could prevent us from obtaining customers and may cause us to pay higher interest rates to attract customers.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our markets from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other super-regional, national, and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere. We compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. Many of our competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions. These institutions offer some services, such as extensive and established branch networks, that we do not provide. There is a risk that we will not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our markets, and that we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, resulting in reduced profitability. In addition, competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to us.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies are inaccurate.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are included in the section captioned \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially affect our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support future growth.\nWe rely on customer deposits, including brokered deposits, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the \u201cFHLB\u201d) and the Federal Reserve, and other borrowings to fund operations. Although the Company has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, if desired, no assurance can be given that we would be able to replace such funds in the future if the financial condition of the FHLB or programs sponsored by the Federal Reserve, regulatory restrictions on brokered deposits or regulatory restrictions on the pricing of local deposits or other market conditions were to change. In addition, certain borrowing sources are on a secured basis. The FHLB has become more restrictive on the types of collateral it will accept and the amount of borrowings allowed on acceptable collateral. Due to changes applied by rating agencies on bonds, changes in collateral requirements or deteriorating loan quality, outstanding borrowings could be required to be repaid, incurring prepayment penalties. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain access to funding at acceptable interest rates. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future operations, our revenues may not increase proportionally to cover these costs. In addition, Crescent Mortgage Company may fund mortgage loans held for sale through a line of credit with the Bank. A decline in economic conditions could affect Crescent Mortgage Company\u2019s ability to fund loans held for sale.\nOur operating results may fluctuate based upon the results of our mortgage subsidiary, Crescent Mortgage Company.\nThere are a number of items that could adversely affect the volumes and margin of the Company\u2019s mortgage banking operations. These include, but are not limited to, the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy including its quantitative easing program, aggressively low rates, reduction in prices paid by the mortgage banking aggregators, aggressive competition, the housing market recovery, the status and financial condition of the FNMA and FHLMC, potential changes in FNMA and FHLMC lending guidelines and programs, proposed changes in the FHA lending requirements, extensive regulatory changes and liquidity. Should these factors significantly impact production of mortgages, it is likely that the Company\u2019s earnings would be adversely affected.\nOur mortgage subsidiary\u2019s operations are exposed to significant repurchase risk.\nCrescent Mortgage Company is exposed to significant repurchase risk on mortgage loan production related to potential reimbursements for loans sold to third parties for borrower fraud, underwriting and documentation issues, early defaults and prepayments of sold loans. If the Company experiences significant losses related to repurchase risk, it is possible that the reserve established for such exposure is not adequate. The Company continues to receive repurchase requests. The Company evaluates each request and provides estimated reserves as necessary. We believe that the reserve related to repurchase risk is adequate to absorb probable losses; however, we cannot predict these losses or whether our reserve will be adequate. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and profitability.\nThe value of our loan servicing portfolio may become impaired in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company serviced approximately $4.0 billion of loans. At that date, our mortgage loan servicing rights were recorded as an asset with a carrying value of approximately $32.9 million. We expect that our loan servicing portfolio will increase in the future. If interest rates decline and the actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates increase or other factors that cause a reduction of the valuation of our mortgage servicing asset, the Company could incur an impairment of its mortgage loan servicing asset.\nHurricanes and other natural disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business.\nThe Company operates in markets that are susceptible to hurricanes and other natural disasters. Large-scale natural disasters may significantly affect loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral, affecting the economies our borrowers live in, and by impairing the ability of the borrower to repay their loans.\nChanges in prevailing interest rates may reduce our profitability.\nOur results of operations depend in large part upon the level of our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Depending on the terms and maturities of our assets and liabilities, we believe it is more likely than not a significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Many factors cause changes in interest rates, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. While we intend to manage the effects of changes in interest rates by adjusting the terms, maturities, and pricing of our assets and liabilities, our efforts may not be effective and our financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nWe are dependent on key individuals, and the loss of one or more of these key individuals could curtail our growth and adversely affect our prospects.\nJerold L. Rexroad, the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, has extensive and long-standing ties within our primary markets. Mr. Rexroad has substantial experience in banking operations, correspondent/wholesale mortgage operations, investment securities, and mergers and acquisitions. The services of Mr. Rexroad would be difficult to replace and our business and development could be materially and adversely affected.\nDavid L. Morrow, the Bank\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, also has extensive and long-standing ties within our primary markets and substantial commercial lending experience within our Charleston and Myrtle Beach markets. The services of Mr. Morrow would be difficult to replace and our business and development could be materially and adversely affected.\nFowler C. Williams, Crescent Mortgage Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, has extensive knowledge and long-standing ties with the mortgage industry. The services of Mr. Williams would be difficult to replace and our wholesale mortgage company results could be materially and adversely affected.\nM.J. Huggins, III, the Company\u2019s Executive Vice President and Secretary, and the Bank\u2019s President, has extensive and long-standing ties within our primary markets and substantial commercial and retail lending experience. The services of Mr. Huggins would be difficult to replace and our business and development could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success also depends, in part, on our continued ability to attract and retain experienced commercial and mortgage loan officers, as well as other management personnel. Competition for personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. Our failure to compete for these personnel, or the loss of the services of several of such key personnel, could adversely affect our business strategy and seriously harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes on banks and bank holding companies. The key effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business are:\n\u00b7 changes to regulatory capital requirements;\n\u00b7 exclusion of hybrid securities, including trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010 from Tier 1 capital;\n\u00b7 creation of new government regulatory agencies (such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which oversees systemic risk, and the CFPB, which develops and enforces rules for bank and non-bank providers of consumer financial products);\n\u00b7 potential limitations on federal preemption;\n\u00b7 changes to deposit insurance assessments;\n\u00b7 regulation of debit interchange fees we earn;\n\u00b7 changes in retail banking regulations, including potential limitations on certain fees we may charge; and\n\u00b7 changes in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and risk retention.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the ability of banks to engage in certain proprietary trading or to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions designed to limit the ability of insured depository institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates to conduct certain swaps and derivatives activities and to take certain principal positions in financial instruments.\nSome provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately upon its enactment. Many provisions, however, will require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies in order to be implemented, some but not all of which have been proposed or finalized by the applicable federal agencies. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may have unintended effects, which will not be clear until after implementation. Certain changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to investors in our common stock.\nOn May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the \u201cEconomic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act,\u201d or the Regulatory Relief Act, which amends parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other laws that involve regulation of the financial industry. While the Regulatory Relief Act keeps in place fundamental aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s regulatory framework, it does change the regulatory framework for depository institutions with assets under $10 billion, such as the Bank, as well as easing some requirements for larger depository institutions. As more fully discussed under \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action,\u201d the legislation includes a number of provisions which are favorable to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Company, and also makes changes to consumer mortgage and credit reporting regulations and to the authorities of the agencies that regulate the financial industry. Because a number of the provisions included in the Regulatory Relief Act require the federal banking agencies to undertake notice and comment rulemaking, it will likely take some time before these provisions are fully implemented.\nThe final Basel III capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule for the Basel III capital framework and, on July 9, 2013, the OCC also adopted a final rule and the FDIC adopted the same provisions in the form of an \u201cinterim final.\u201d The requirements in the rule began to phase in on January 1, 2014 for advanced approaches banking organizations, and on January 1, 2015 for other covered banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank. The requirements in the rule were fully phased in by January 1, 2019. These rules substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us.\nThe final rules increase capital requirements and generally include two new capital measurements that will affect us, a risk-based Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and a capital conservation buffer. Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as additional Tier 1 capital and must be phased out over a period of nine years beginning in 2015. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets (such as us) to continue to include trust preferred securities and non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not CET1. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that have historically been placed in Tier 2, as well as cumulative perpetual preferred stock.\nThe final rules adjust all three categories of capital by requiring new deductions from and adjustments to capital that will result in more stringent capital requirements and may require changes in the ways we do business. Among other things, the current rule on the deduction of mortgage servicing assets from Tier 1 capital has been revised in ways that are likely to require a greater deduction than we currently make and that will require the deduction to be made from CET1. We closely monitor our mortgage servicing assets, and we expect to maintain our mortgage servicing asset at levels that approximate the deduction thresholds through a combination of sales of portions of these assets from time to time either on a flowing basis as we originate mortgages or through bulk sale transactions. Additionally, any gains on sales from mortgage loans sold into securitizations must be deducted in full from CET1.\nBeginning in 2015, our minimum capital requirements were increased to (i) a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%. Our leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer began to phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a require CET1 ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. While the final rules will result in higher regulatory capital standards, it is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to us.\nIn addition to the higher required capital ratios and the new deductions and adjustments, the final rules increased the risk weights for certain assets, meaning that we will have to hold more capital against these assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150%, rather than the previous requirement of 100%. There are also new risk weights for unsettled transactions and derivatives. We also are required to hold capital against short-term commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable; currently, there are no capital requirements currently for these off-balance sheet assets.\nIn addition, in the current economic and regulatory environment, bank regulators may impose capital requirements that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations. The application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying our business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back our shares.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \u201cUSA PATRIOT Act\u201d), and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. Since 2013, the CFPB has issued several rules on mortgage lending, notably a rule requiring all home mortgage lenders to determine a borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan. Loans with certain terms and conditions and that otherwise meet the definition of a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d may be protected from liability to a borrower for failing to make the necessary determinations. In either case, we may find it necessary to tighten our mortgage loan underwriting standards in response to the CFPB rules, which may constrain our ability to make loans consistent with our business strategies. It is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers\u2019 ability to repay, but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nOur common stock was registered under the Exchange Act in 2014, thereby subjecting the Company to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations have and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Although we have hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe also expect that being a public reporting company, our higher market capitalization, and these new rules and regulations will increase the costs of our director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this report and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the bank cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the bank. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face risks as we seek to expand through acquisitions or mergers.\nFrom time to time, we seek to acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions. We may also expand into new markets or lines of business or offer new products or services. These activities would involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 the potential inaccuracy of the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to a target institution;\n\u00b7 the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring or retaining experienced local management, and opening new offices and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u00b7 the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse effects on our results of operations; and\n\u00b7 the risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties and our financial condition could be adversely affected if we rely on misleading information.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which we do not independently verify. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, we may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends is limited, and we may be unable to pay future dividends even if we desire to do so.\nThe Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve\u2019s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. In addition, under the prompt corrective action regulations, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends may be limited by regulatory restrictions, by our Bank\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends to the Company and by our need to maintain sufficient capital to support our operations. As a South Carolina chartered bank, the Bank is subject to limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay. Unless otherwise instructed by the SCBFI, the Bank is generally permitted under South Carolina state banking regulations to pay cash dividends of up to 100% of net income in any calendar year without obtaining the prior approval of the SCBFI. If our Bank is not permitted to pay cash dividends to the Company, it is unlikely that we would be able to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Moreover, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, and if declared by our board of directors. Although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, and terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As customer, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunication outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and as described below, cyber-attacks.\nAs noted above, our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct its operations. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 confidential information. Third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries, or vendors that provide service or security solutions for our operations, and other unaffiliated third parties could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.\nWhile we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputation damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nNegative public opinion surrounding our Company and the financial institutions industry generally could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and our ability to make loans or to acquire deposits.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion surrounding our company and the financial institutions industry generally, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in losses to our investors and litigation against us.\nSeveral factors could cause our stock price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include but are not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in earnings, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, our announcement of developments related to our businesses, operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, new technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors, news reports of trends, irrational exuberance on the part of investors, new federal banking regulations, and other issues related to the financial services industry. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our normal business.\nFuture sales of our stock by our stockholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause our stock price to decline.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cCARO,\u201d the trading volume in our common stock is lower than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions.\nEconomic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to us. If we have to issue shares of common stock, they will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing stockholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock and adversely affect the terms on which we may obtain additional capital.\nWe may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments or to strengthen our capital position. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control and our financial performance. We cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, or if we do raise additional capital that it will not be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nIf we determine, for any reason, that we need to raise capital, our board generally has the authority, without action by or vote of the stockholders, to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of stock for any corporate purpose, including issuance of equity-based incentives under or outside of our equity compensation plans. Additionally, we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur. Any issuance of additional shares of stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our stockholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock. Shares we issue in connection with any such offering will increase the total number of shares and may dilute the economic and voting ownership interest of our existing stockholders.\nOur board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock that would adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders.\nOur authorized capital stock includes 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which no preferred shares are issued and outstanding. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock from the authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. Subject to limitations imposed by law or our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is empowered to determine:\n\u00b7 the designation of, and the number of, shares constituting each series of preferred stock;\n\u00b7 the dividend rate for each series;\n\u00b7 the terms and conditions of any voting, conversion and exchange rights for each series;\n\u00b7 the amounts payable on each series on redemption or our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;\n\u00b7 the provisions of any sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of shares of any series; and\n\u00b7 the preferences and the relative rights among the series of preferred stock.\nWe could issue preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the shares of our common stock and with preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends and in liquidation.\nOur securities are not FDIC insured.\nOur securities, including our common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of the Bank, are not insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, the FDIC or any other governmental agency and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.", "PERMNO": 14793, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CARO"}
