{"cik": "1217234", "company": "CareDx, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. If any of the follows risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses, and we expect to incur net losses for the next several years.\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since our inception, and we may continue to incur additional losses for the next several years. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our net loss was $22.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $333.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and anticipate that our expenses will increase due to costs relating to, among other things:\n\u2022researching, developing, validating and commercializing potential new testing services, products and digital solutions, including additional expenses in connection with our continuing development and commercialization of KidneyCare, HeartCare, AlloSeq, AiTraC and other future solutions;\n\u2022developing, presenting and publishing additional clinical and economic utility data intended to increase payer coverage and clinician adoption of our current and future solutions;\n\u2022expansion of our operating capabilities;\n\u2022maintenance, expansion and protection of our intellectual property portfolio and trade secrets;\n\u2022the process of fully integrating acquired companies and operations and the associated potential disruptions to our business;\n\u2022future clinical trials;\n\u2022expansion of the size and geographic reach of our sales force and our marketing capabilities to commercialize our existing and future solutions;\n\u2022employment of additional clinical, quality control, scientific, customer service, laboratory, billing and reimbursement and management personnel;\n\u2022compliance with existing and changing laws, regulations and standards, including those relating to corporate governance and public disclosure and regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC;\n\u2022employment of operational, financial, accounting and information systems personnel, consistent with expanding our operations and our status as a public company; and\n\u2022failure to achieve expected operating results may cause a future impairment of goodwill or other assets.\nEven if we achieve significant revenues, we may not become profitable, and even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain consistently profitable could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could significantly impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue to pursue our growth strategy or even continue to operate. For a detailed discussion of our financial condition and results of operations, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe may require additional financing.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $38.2 million and an accumulated deficit of $333.8 million. We may require additional financing in the future to fund working capital, pay our obligations as they come due and fund our acquisitions of complementary businesses and assets. Additional financing might include issuance of equity securities, debt, cash from collaboration agreements, or a combination of these. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us.\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenues from Medicare, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, reimbursement from Medicare would severely and adversely affect our financial performance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue from Medicare for AlloMap Heart and AlloSure represented 66% of testing services revenue. However, we may not be able to maintain or increase our tests reimbursed by Medicare for a variety of reasons, including changes in reimbursement practices, general policy shifts, or reductions in reimbursement amounts. We cannot predict whether Medicare reimbursements will continue at the same payment amount or with the same breadth of coverage in the future, if at all.\nThe Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA includes a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenues from payments made under the CLFS report initially and then on a subsequent three-year basis thereafter (or annually for advanced diagnostic\nlaboratory tests, or ADLTs), private payer payment rates and volumes for their tests. The final PAMA ruling was issued June 17, 2016 and the new market based rates took effect January 1, 2018. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, will use the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for the tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payer payment rates for the tests. Under PAMA, the reimbursement rate for AlloMap Heart is currently $3,240 for Medicare beneficiaries.\nOn September 26, 2017, we announced that the Molecular Diagnostic Services, or MolDX, Program developed by Palmetto GBA, or Palmetto, has set AlloSure Kidney reimbursement at $2,841. AlloSure Kidney began to be reimbursed for kidney transplants covered by Medicare across the United States on October 9, 2017, the effective date of the Palmetto local coverage determination, or LCD.\nIf an AlloMap Heart or AlloSure Kidney reimbursement rate that is significantly lower than the current rate is set by CMS or MolDx in the future, it could cause us to discontinue AlloMap Heart or AlloSure Kidney testing for Medicare patients because providing tests at a substantially lowered reimbursement rate may not be economically viable. Given the significant portion of payments represented by Medicare, our remaining test revenue may be insufficient to sustain our operations.\nIf future reimbursement levels are less than the current price, our revenues and our ability to achieve profitability could be impaired, and the market price of our common stock could decline. We may also not be able to maintain or increase the portion of our tests reimbursed by Medicare for a variety of other reasons, including changes in reimbursement practices and general policy shifts.\nOn a five-year rotational basis, Medicare requests bids for its regional Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MAC, services. The MAC for California is currently Noridian Healthcare Solutions. Our current Medicare coverage through Noridian provides for reimbursement for tests performed for qualifying Medicare patients throughout the U.S. so long as the tests are performed in our California laboratory. We cannot predict whether Noridian or any future MAC will continue to provide reimbursement for AlloMap Heart or AlloSure Kidney at the same payment amount or with the same breadth of coverage in the future, if at all. Additional changes in the MAC processing Medicare claims for AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart could impact the coverage or payment amount for our tests and our ability to obtain Medicare coverage for any products we may launch in the future.\nAny decision by CMS or its local contractors to reduce or deny coverage for our tests would have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations and ability to operate and raise capital. Any such decision could also cause affected clinicians treating Medicare covered patients to reduce or discontinue the use of our tests.\nOur financial results currently are largely dependent on sales of AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart tests and products, and we will need to generate sufficient revenues from these and other solutions and tests we develop to grow our business.\nWe expect that sales of testing services and products will account for a substantial portion of our revenue for at least the next two years. If we are unable to increase sales of our testing services or products or successfully develop and commercialize other solutions, tests or enhancements, our revenues and ability to achieve profitability would be impaired, and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe could become subject to legal proceedings that could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and settlements/judgments, require significant amounts of management attention and result in the diversion of significant operational resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have in the past been, and from time to time in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the ordinary course of, or otherwise in connection with, our business. For example, in response to our false advertising suit filed against Natera on April 10, 2019, Natera filed a counterclaim against us on February 18, 2020, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging CareDx made false and misleading claims about the performance capabilities of AlloSure. In addition, in response to our patent infringement suit filed against Natera on March 26, 2019, Natera filed suit against us on January 13th, 2020, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging, among other things, that AlloSure infringes Natera\u2019s U.S. Patent 10,526,658. The suit seeks a judgment that we have infringed Natera\u2019s patent, an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining us from any further infringement of such patent and unspecified damages. We intend to defend both of these matters vigorously, and believe we have good and substantial defenses to the claims alleged in the suits, but there is no guarantee that we will prevail.\nLitigation is inherently unpredictable. It is possible that an adverse result in one or more of these possible future events could have a material adverse effect on us including increased expenses to defend, settle or resolve such litigation.\nThe development and commercialization of additional diagnostic solutions are key to our growth strategy. New test or product development involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be successful in our efforts to develop and commercialize additional diagnostic solutions.\nKey elements of our strategy are to discover, develop, validate and commercialize a portfolio of new diagnostic solutions. We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully complete development of or commercialize any of our planned future solutions, or that they will prove to be capable of reliably being used for organ surveillance in the heart or in other types of organs. Before we can successfully develop and commercialize any of our currently planned or other new diagnostic solutions, we will need to:\n\u2022conduct substantial research and development;\n\u2022obtain the necessary testing samples and related data;\n\u2022conduct clinical validation studies;\n\u2022expend significant funds;\n\u2022expand and scale-up our laboratory processes;\n\u2022expand and train our sales force;\n\u2022gain acceptance from ordering clinicians at a larger number of transplant centers;\n\u2022gain acceptance from ordering laboratories associated with transplant centers; and\n\u2022seek and obtain regulatory clearance or approvals of our new solutions, as required by applicable regulations.\nThis process involves a high degree of risk and may take up to several years or more. Our test development and commercialization efforts may be delayed or fail for many reasons, including:\n\u2022failure of the test at the research or development stage;\n\u2022difficulty in accessing suitable testing samples, especially testing samples with known clinical results;\n\u2022lack of clinical validation data to support the effectiveness of the test;\n\u2022delays resulting from the failure of third-party suppliers or contractors to meet their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022failure to obtain or maintain necessary clearances or approvals to market the test; or\n\u2022lack of commercial acceptance by patients, clinicians or third-party payers.\nFew research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical studies often is not replicated in later studies. At any point, we may abandon development of new diagnostic solutions, or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical trials, which would adversely impact the timing for generating potential revenues from those new diagnostic solutions. In addition, as we develop diagnostic solutions, we will have to make additional investments in our sales and marketing operations, which may be prematurely or unnecessarily incurred if the commercial launch of a test is abandoned or delayed. If a clinical validation study fails to demonstrate the prospectively defined endpoints of the study, we would likely abandon the development of the test or test feature that was the subject of the clinical trial, which could harm our business.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect, the commercialization of additional diagnostic solutions by us may be delayed and, as a result, our business will suffer and our stock price may decline.\nFrom time to time, we expect to estimate and publicly announce the anticipated timing of the accomplishment of various clinical and other product development goals. In addition, we have included a discussion of a number of anticipated targets elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The actual timing of accomplishment of these targets could vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. We cannot be certain that we will meet our projected targets and if we do not meet these targets as publicly announced, the commercialization of our diagnostic solutions may be delayed or may not occur at all and, as a result, our business will suffer and our stock price may decline.\nThe field of diagnostic testing in transplantation is evolving and is subject to rapid technological change. If we are unable to develop solutions to keep pace with rapid medical and scientific change, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe field of diagnostic testing in transplantation is evolving. Although there have been few advances in technology relating to organ rejection in transplant recipients, the market for medical diagnostic companies is marked by rapid and substantial technological development and innovations that could make AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart and our other products and digital solutions, including those in development, outdated. We must continually innovate, expand and update our test offerings to address unmet needs in monitoring transplant related conditions. AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart, and our other products and digital solutions, including those in development, could become obsolete unless we continually innovate, enhance and expand our product offerings to include new clinical applications. If we are unable to demonstrate the effectiveness of AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart, our other products and digital solutions and future diagnostic solutions and tests, if any, compared to new methodologies and technologies, then sales of our tests, products, and digital solutions could decline, which would harm our business and financial results.\nIf clinicians, hospital administrators, medical centers and laboratories do not adopt our diagnostic solutions, we will not achieve future sales growth.\nClinicians and healthcare administrators are traditionally slow to adopt new products, testing practices and clinical treatments, partly because of perceived liability risks and the uncertainty of third-party reimbursement. It is critical to the success of our sales efforts that we continue to educate clinicians, administrators and laboratory directors about our testing services, products and digital solutions, and demonstrate the clinical and diagnostic benefits of these services, products and digital solutions. We believe that clinicians, transplant centers and laboratories may not use our services, products and digital solutions unless they determine, based on published peer-reviewed journal articles, the experience of other clinicians or laboratory verification, that our services, products and digital solutions provide accurate, reliable and cost-effective information that is useful in pre-transplant matching and monitoring their post-transplant recipients.\nOur product kits are sold to hundreds of laboratories, mainly in Europe and the U.S. Laboratories order our products based on the accuracy, speed and cost of the test together with the cost and availability of equipment on which to run the test. Switching to or adopting our products may require the purchase of new and costly testing equipment. To attract new laboratory customers, the performance of our products must provide a performance or cost advantages over similar products sold by our competitors.\nIf clinicians, hospital administrators and laboratories do not adopt and continue to use our tests and products or our future solutions and tests, our business and financial results will suffer.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nHistorically, our financial results have been, and we expect that our operating results will continue to be, subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net income (loss) and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to successfully market and sell our testing services and products;\n\u2022our ability to successfully commercialize new diagnostic solutions;\n\u2022the amount of our research and development expenditures;\n\u2022the timing of cash collections from third-party payers;\n\u2022the extent to which our current and future solutions, if any, are eligible for coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers;\n\u2022the process of integrating new acquisitions, and the associated potential disruption to our business;\n\u2022changes in coverage and reimbursement or in reimbursement-related laws directly affecting our business;\n\u2022any intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved or that otherwise may affect our intellectual property position;\n\u2022announcements by our competitors of new or competitive products;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments affecting our test or competing products;\n\u2022total operating expenses; and\n\u2022changes in expectation as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates, publications or research reports by securities analysts.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nIf the use of AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart, or any of our other solutions is not supported by studies published in peer-reviewed scientific and medical publications, and then periodically supplemented with additional support in peer-reviewed journals, the rate of adoption of our current and future solutions by clinicians and treatment centers and the rate of reimbursement of our current and future solutions by payers may be negatively affected.\nTransplant, like all specialties, is based on evidence-based medicine. As a result, laying a strong foundation of evidence and improved clinical utility is essential in the adoption of the tools offered by us. The results of our studies involving AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart have been presented at major medical society congresses and published in peer-reviewed publications in leading medical journals. This continued presence in peer-reviewed publications is necessary to promote clinician adoption and favorable reimbursement decisions. We believe that peer-reviewed journal articles that provide evidence of the utility of our solutions or the technology underlying AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart, and our other products and digital solutions are very important to the commercial success of our solutions. Clinicians typically take a significant amount of time to adopt new products, testing practices and clinical treatments, partly because of perceived liability risks and the uncertainty of third-party reimbursement. It is critical to the success of our sales efforts that we educate a sufficient number of clinicians and administrators about AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart and our future solutions, and demonstrate the clinical benefits of these solutions. Clinicians may not adopt, and third-party payers may not cover or adequately reimburse for, our current and future products and digital solutions unless they determine, based on published peer-reviewed journal articles and the experience of other clinicians, that our diagnostic current and future products and digital solutions provide accurate, reliable and cost-effective information that is useful in monitoring transplant recipients and making informed and timely treatment decisions.\nThe administration of clinical and economic utility studies is expensive and demands significant attention from our management team. Data collected from these studies may not be positive or consistent with our existing data, or may not be statistically significant or compelling to the medical community. If the results obtained from our ongoing or future studies are inconsistent with certain results obtained from our previous studies, adoption of our current and future products and digital solutions would suffer and our business would be harmed. While we have had success in generating peer-reviewed publications regarding AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart, additional peer-reviewed publications regarding AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart and our future products and digital solutions may be limited by many factors, including delays in the completion of, poor design of, or lack of compelling data from clinical studies that would be the subject of the article. If our current and future products and digital solutions or the technology underlying AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart, or our future products and digital solutions do not receive sufficient favorable exposure in peer-reviewed publications, the rate of clinician adoption and positive reimbursement coverage decisions could be negatively affected. The publication of clinical data in peer-reviewed journals is a crucial step in commercializing and obtaining reimbursement for diagnostic solutions such as ours, and our inability to control when, if ever, results are published may delay or limit our ability to derive sufficient revenue from any product that is the subject of a study.\nTo ensure the success of AlloSure Kidney and future tests based on donor-derived cell-free DNA, or dd-cfDNA, we will need to continue our efforts to complete and publicize research and trials, especially the Kidney Allograft Outcomes AlloSure Registry, or K-OAR, registry study, that provides evidence of the utility of dd-cfDNA and validate AlloSure Kidney as a solution.\nTransplant centers may not adopt AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart, or our other solutions due to historical practices or due to more favorable reimbursement policies associated with other means of monitoring transplants.\nDue to the historically limited monitoring options and the well-established coverage and reimbursement for biopsies, clinicians are accustomed to monitoring for acute rejection in kidney and heart transplant recipients by utilizing biopsies. Many clinicians use AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart in parallel with biopsies rather than as an alternative to biopsies. While we do not market AlloSure Kidney or AlloMap Heart as biopsy alternatives, per se, if treatment center administrators view our test as an alternative to a biopsy but believe they would derive more revenue from the performance of biopsies, such administrators may be motivated to reduce or avoid the use of our test. While biopsies are less common for monitoring kidney transplant patients, there are transplant centers that manage patients with protocol biopsies, which could impact AlloSure Kidney revenue. We cannot provide assurance that our efforts will increase the use of our test by new or existing customers. Our failure to increase the frequency of use of our test by new and existing customers would adversely affect our growth and revenues.\nIf we are unable to successfully compete with larger and more established players in the clinical surveillance of the transplantation field, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenues or achieve profitability.\nOur AlloSure Kidney solution for kidney transplant recipients competes against existing diagnostic tests utilized by pathologists, which involves evaluating biopsy samples to determine the presence or absence of rejection. However, because of the risks and discomforts of the invasive kidney biopsy procedure, as well as the expense and relatively low rate of finding moderate to severe grade rejection, biopsy is not a standard practice for surveillance of transplanted kidneys. Additional competition for kidney surveillance diagnostics currently comes from general, non-specific clinical chemistry tests such as serum creatinine, urine protein, complete blood count, lipid profile and others that are widely ordered by physician offices and routinely performed in clinical reference labs and hospital labs. Our competitors also include companies that are focused on the development and commercialization of molecular diagnostic tests. In the field of post-transplant surveillance, Natera and Eurofins, have commercially available molecular diagnostics tests.\nCompetition for our AlloMap Heart solution for heart transplant recipients also comes from biopsies, which generally involve evaluating biopsy samples to determine the presence or absence of rejection. This practice has been the standard of care in the United States for many years, and we will need to continue to educate clinicians, transplant recipients and payers about the various benefits of our test in order to change clinical practice.\nWe expect the competition for pre-transplant typing and post-transplant surveillance to increase as there are numerous established and startup companies in the process of developing products and services for the transplant market which may directly or indirectly compete with our existing pre- and post-transplant solutions, or our development pipeline. Competition from other companies, especially those with an eye toward transitioning to more automated typing processes, could impact our ability to maintain market share and its current margins. For example, we launched QTYPE in September 2016 and QTYPE competes with other quantitative polymerase chain reaction products including products offered by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., or Thermo Fisher, as well as alternatives to polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, such as next generation sequencing, or NGS, typing products. In addition to businesses focused on pre-transplantation such as Thermo Fisher\u2019s One Lambda and Immucor, Inc.\u2019s LIFECODES, companies that have not historically focused on transplantation, but that possesses existing knowledge of dd-cfDNA technology have indicated they are considering this market.\nCompetition for our digital solutions include various companies that develop application software and operate in the healthcare field. Our primary competitor in this field is Epic Systems Corporation, or Epic. In addition, other established and emerging healthcare, information technology and service companies may commercialize competitive products including informatics, analysis, integrated genetic tools and services for health and wellness.\nThe field of clinical surveillance of transplantation is evolving. New and well established companies are devoting substantial resources to the application of molecular diagnostics to the treatment of medical conditions. Some of these companies may elect to develop and market diagnostic solutions in the post-transplant surveillance market.\nMany of our potential competitors may have greater brand recognition or substantially greater financial and technical resources and development, production and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop lower-priced, less complex tests that could be viewed by clinicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart tests, which could force us to lower the current list price of our test and impact our operating margins and our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance for and sales of AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart and our products and digital solutions, which could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or achieving profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIf we are unable to successfully and continually update our products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired and our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe operate in an environment characterized by rapid development and continuing innovation. We will need to continue to maintain the value of our product offering. To compete successfully, we must continually update our product range and produce continually updated test kits and software. The failure to maintain the quality of our products or inability to keep pace with this innovation could render our existing or future solutions obsolete or less attractive to lab directors and clinicians. Any failure to anticipate or develop new or enhanced solutions in a timely manner could result in decreased revenue and harm to our business and prospects. If we fail to introduce new or enhanced solutions that meet the needs of our customers, we will lose market share and our business, operating results and prospects will be adversely affected.\nOur research and development efforts will be hindered if we are not able to acquire or contract with third parties for access to additional tissue and blood samples.\nOur clinical development relies on our ability to secure access to tissue and blood samples, as well as recipient information including biopsy results and clinical outcomes from the same patient. Furthermore, the studies through which our future solutions are developed may rely on access to multiple samples from the same recipient over a period of time as opposed to samples at a single point in time or archived samples. We will require additional samples and recipient data for future research, development and validation. Access to recipients and samples on a real-time, or non-archived, basis is limited and often on an exclusive basis, and there is no guarantee that future initiatives will be successful in obtaining and validating additional samples. Additionally, the process of negotiating access to new and archived donor and recipient data and samples is lengthy since it typically involves numerous parties and approval levels to resolve complex issues, such as usage rights, institutional review board approval, recipient consent, privacy rights and informed consent of recipients, publication rights, intellectual property ownership and research parameters. If we are not able to acquire or negotiate access to new and archived donor and recipient data and tissue and blood samples with source institutions, or if other laboratories or our competitors secure access to these samples before us, our ability to research, develop and commercialize future solutions such as AlloSure Kidney will be limited or delayed.\nIf we cannot maintain existing clinical collaborations and enter into new ones, our efforts to commercialize and develop products could be delayed.\nIn the past, we have entered into clinical collaborations with highly regarded academic institutions and leading treatment centers in the transplant field. Our success in the future may depend in part on our ability to enter into agreements with other leading institutions in the transplant field. Securing these agreements can be difficult due to internal and external constraints placed on these organizations. Some organizations may limit the number of collaborations they have with any one company so as to not be perceived as biased or conflicted. Organizations may also have insufficient administrative and related infrastructure to enable collaborations with many companies at once, which can extend the time it takes to develop, negotiate and implement a collaboration. In addition to completing clinical collaborations, publication of clinical data in peer-reviewed journals is a crucial step in commercializing and obtaining coverage and reimbursement for solutions such as ours. Our inability to control when, if ever, results of such studies are published may delay or limit our ability to derive sufficient revenues from any test that may result from a collaboration.\nFrom time to time, we expect to engage in discussions with potential clinical collaborators, which may or may not lead to collaborations. We cannot guarantee that any discussions will result in clinical collaborations or that any clinical studies that may result will be enrolled or completed in a reasonable time frame or with successful outcomes. Once news of discussions regarding possible collaborations becomes known in the medical community, regardless of whether the news is accurate, failure to announce a collaborative agreement or the other entity\u2019s announcement of a collaboration with an entity other than us may result in adverse speculation about us, our current and future solutions or our technology, resulting in harm to our reputation and our business.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage our growth and support demand for our tests, our business may suffer.\nAs the volume of the tests that we perform grows, we will need to continue to ramp up our testing capacity, implement increases in scale and related processing, customer service, billing and systems process improvements and expand our internal quality assurance program to support testing on a larger scale. We will also need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific and technical personnel to process our tests. We cannot be certain that any increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance will be successfully implemented or that appropriate personnel will be available. As additional products are developed, we may need to bring new equipment on-line, implement new systems, technology, controls and procedures and hire personnel with different qualifications. We plan to expand our sales force to support additional products. There is significant competition for qualified, productive sales personnel with advanced sales skills and technical knowledge in our field. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient qualified sales personnel.\nThe value of AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart depends, in large part, on our ability to perform AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart tests on a timely basis and at a high quality standard, and on our reputation for such timeliness and quality. Failure to implement necessary procedures, transition to new equipment or processes or hire new personnel could result in higher costs of processing or an inability to meet market demand in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that we will be able to perform AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart or our future solutions, if any, on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand, that our efforts to scale our commercial operations will not negatively affect the quality of test results or that we will be successful in responding to the growing complexity of our testing operations. If we encounter difficulty meeting market demand for our current and future solutions, our reputation could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer.\nIn addition, our growth may place a significant strain on our management, operating and financial systems and our sales, marketing and administrative resources. As a result of our growth, our operating costs may escalate even faster than planned, and some of our internal systems may need to be enhanced or replaced. If we cannot effectively manage our expanding operations and our costs, we may not be able to grow effectively or we may grow at a slower pace, and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur past revenue growth rates may not be indicative of future growth, and we may not grow at all, and revenue may decline.\nFrom 2018 to 2019, our revenue grew from $76.6 million to 127.1 million, which represents annual growth of 66%. In the future, our revenue may not grow at all and it may decline. We believe that our future revenue will depend on, among other factors:\n\u2022the continued usage and acceptance of our current and future solutions;\n\u2022demand for our testing services, products and digital solutions;\n\u2022the introduction and acceptance of new or enhanced products or services by us or by competitors;\n\u2022our ability to maintain reimbursement for AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart and secure reimbursement for our future solutions;\n\u2022our ability to anticipate and effectively adapt to developing markets and to rapidly changing technologies;\n\u2022our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel;\n\u2022the initiation, renewal or expiration of significant contracts with our commercial partners;\n\u2022pricing changes by us, our suppliers or our competitors; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and other factors.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to manage any of the foregoing, and any failure to be successful in these efforts could materially and adversely affect revenue growth. You should not consider our past revenue growth to be indicative of future growth.\nIf our laboratory facility in the U.S. becomes inoperable, we will be unable to perform AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart, and future testing solutions, if any, and our business will be harmed.\nWe perform all of our testing services for the U.S. in our laboratory located in Brisbane, California. We do not have redundant laboratory facilities. Brisbane, California is situated on or near earthquake fault lines. Our facility and the equipment we use to perform testing services would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace, if damaged or destroyed. Our facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires, flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our tests for some period of time. The inability to perform our tests may result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers in the future. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, we do not have earthquake insurance and thus coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn order to establish a redundant laboratory facility, we would have to spend considerable time and money securing adequate space, constructing the facility, recruiting and training employees, and establishing the additional operational and administrative infrastructure necessary to support a second facility. Additionally, any new clinical laboratory facility opened by us in the U.S. would be required to be certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. We would also be required to secure and maintain state licenses required by several states, including California, Florida, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, which can take a significant amount of time and result in delays in our ability to begin operations at that facility. If we failed to secure any such licenses, we would not be able to process samples from recipients in such states. We also expect that it would be difficult, time-consuming and costly to train, equip and use a third-party to perform tests on our behalf. We could only use another facility with the established state licensures and CLIA certification necessary to perform AlloSure Kidney,AlloMap Heart, or future solutions following validation and other required procedures. We cannot be certain that we would be able to find another CLIA-certified facility willing or able to adopt AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart, or future solutions and comply with the required procedures, or that this laboratory would be willing or able to perform the tests for us on commercially reasonable terms.\nPerformance issues, service interruptions or price increases by our shipping carriers could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation and ability to provide our services on a timely basis.\nExpedited, reliable shipping is essential to our operations. We rely heavily on providers of transport services for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of recipient samples to our laboratory and enhanced tracking of these recipient samples. Should a carrier encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage or destruction of a sample, it may be difficult to replace our patient samples in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our services and increased cost and expense to our business. In addition, any significant increase in shipping rates could adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. Similarly, strikes, severe weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions affecting delivery services we use would adversely affect our ability to receive and process recipient samples on a timely basis.\nOur ability to commercialize our testing solutions that we develop is dependent on our relationships with laboratory services providers and their willingness to support our current and future solutions.\nWe rely on third-party laboratory services providers to draw and partially process the patient blood samples that are analyzed in our Brisbane, California laboratory. Our business will suffer if these service providers do not support AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart or the other solutions that we may develop. For example, these laboratories may determine that processing the samples for our solutions requires too much additional effort. Additionally, if transplant facilities have relationships with large reference laboratories that will not process and send out our specimens, the clinicians at these facilities may deem ordering our tests outside of these relationships too inconvenient for their patients. A lack of acceptance of our current and future solutions by these service providers could result in lower test volume.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future, it may limit our ability to develop and commercialize new diagnostic solutions and technologies, and we may have to curtail or cease operations.\nWe expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure, commercial operations and research and development activities. Specifically, we may need to raise additional capital to, among other things:\n\u2022develop other solutions for clinical surveillance in transplantation;\n\u2022increase our selling and marketing efforts to drive market adoption and address competitive developments;\n\u2022expand our clinical laboratory operations;\n\u2022fund our clinical validation study activities;\n\u2022expand our research and development activities;\n\u2022sustain or achieve broader commercialization of AlloSure Kidney, KidneyCare, AlloMap Heart, HeartCare, our products, and digital solutions or enhancements to those tests, products and digital solutions;\n\u2022acquire or license products or technologies including through acquisitions; and\n\u2022finance our capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the level of research and development investment required to develop our new solutions;\n\u2022costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022our need or decision to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;\n\u2022changes in test development plans needed to address any difficulties in commercialization;\n\u2022competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022whether our diagnostic solutions become subject to additional FDA or other regulation; and\n\u2022changes in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations.\nAdditional capital, if needed, may not be available on satisfactory terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our existing stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock and would result in dilution to our stockholders. For example, we have the ability to sell up to $50.0 million of additional shares of our common stock to the public through an \u201cat the market\u201d offering pursuant to the Sales Agreement we entered into with Jefferies, LLC, on August 31, 2018. Any shares of common stock issued in the at-the-market offering will result in dilution to the existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or our solutions under development, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to scale back our operations or limit our research and development activities, which may cause us to grow at a slower pace, or not at all, and our business could be adversely affected.\nThe loss of key members of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, clinicians and laboratory and field personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our executive management team. The efforts of each of these persons will be critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies and testing processes. If we were to lose one or more of these key employees, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategies. We do not currently maintain \"key person\" insurance on any of our employees.\nOur research and development programs and commercial laboratory operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and technicians, including geneticists, biostatisticians, engineers, licensed laboratory technicians and chemists. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also face competition from universities, public and private research institutions and other organizations in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel.\nIn addition, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain laboratory and field personnel with extensive experience in transplant recipient care and surveillance and close relationships with clinicians, pathologists and other hospital personnel. We may have difficulties locating, recruiting or retaining qualified salespeople, which could cause a delay or decline in the rate of adoption of AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart, or our future solutions, if any. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to support our discovery, development, verification and commercialization programs.\nRecent and future acquisitions and investments could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition and operating results, dilute your ownership of us and increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and assets, as well as technology licensing arrangements to expand our existing know-how, expertise and intellectual property in other fields, including for the development of other commercial tests. We also may pursue strategic alliances that leverage our core technology and industry experience to expand our test offerings or distribution. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not successfully complete acquisitions that we target in the future. Risks we may face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u2022diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022reduction of available cash reserves, assumption of debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities due to payment of consideration;\n\u2022coordination of research and development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022integration of product and service offerings;\n\u2022expectations for acquired technology or research and development may prove unsuccessful;\n\u2022inability to retain key personnel from the acquired company;\n\u2022financial reporting, revenue recognition or other financial control deficiencies of or arising from the acquired company that we do not adequately address and that cause our reported results to be incorrect or delayed;\n\u2022liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;\n\u2022integrating a global workforce of the acquired company into our business;\n\u2022obtaining the approval of minority shareholders to complete an acquisition; and\n\u2022commercialization of new products being developed by the acquired company.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. There is also a risk that future acquisitions will result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, incremental operating expenses or the write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture.\nTo finance any acquisitions, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute your interest in us. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nUndetected errors or defects in our products could result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions, including recall of our products, as well as harm our reputation, decrease market acceptance of our products and expose us to product liability or professional liability claims, which could exceed our resources.\nOur products may contain undetected errors or defects that are not identified until after the products are first introduced. Disruptions or other performance problems with our products, or the perception of disruption or performance problems with our products, may require us to initiate a product recall, such as the recall that occurred in April 2016 with respect to one of the Olerup products, and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses and harm our reputation. We may also be subject to warranty and liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our products. A material liability claim, product recall or similar occurrence may cause us to incur significant expense, decrease market acceptance of our products and adversely impact our business and operating results.\nIn addition, the marketing, sale and use of AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart and our other products and solutions, or activities related to our research and clinical studies could lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect which resulted in the failure to adequately perform the analysis for which it was designed. For example, a defect in one of our diagnostic solutions could lead to a false positive or false negative result, affecting the eventual diagnosis. Any incomplete or inaccurate analysis on the part of our technicians could also affect the reliability of the test results. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend, either of which could materially harm our business or financial condition. We cannot provide assurance that our product liability insurance would adequately protect our assets from the financial impact of defending product liability or professional liability claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of any such claims. In addition, any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates and prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future at reasonable coverage levels, or at all. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation, result in the suspension of our testing pending an investigation into the cause of the alleged failure, or cause current collaborators to terminate existing agreements and potential collaborators to seek other partners, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on third party service providers. Failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in our relationship with these providers or their provision of services to us, could interfere with our ability to provide test results for our testing services business and kits for our products business.\nOur relationship with any of our third party service providers may impair our ability to perform our services. The failure of any of our third party service providers to adequately perform their service obligations may reduce our revenues and increase our expenses or prevent us from providing our products and services in a timely manner if at all. In addition, our reputation, business and financial performance could be materially harmed if we are unable to, or are perceived as unable to provide test kits and perform reliable services.\nWe rely solely on certain suppliers to supply some of the laboratory instruments and key reagents that we use in the production of our products and/or in the performance of our tests. These sole source suppliers include Thermo Fisher, which supplies us with instruments, laboratory reagents and consumables, Roche Molecular Systems, which supplies us with laboratory reagents and consumables; Illumina, which supplies us with instruments, laboratory reagents, and consumables; Becton, Dickinson and Company, and Streck, which supplies us with cell preparation tubes; Beckman Coulter, which provides laboratory reagents and consumables; and Qiagen N.V., which supplies us with a proprietary buffer reagent. We do not have guaranteed supply agreements with Thermo Fisher, Becton, Dickinson and Company, or Qiagen N.V., which exposes us to the risk that these suppliers may choose to discontinue doing business with us at any time. We periodically forecast our needs to these sole source suppliers and enter into standard purchase orders based on these forecasts.\nIn addition, our ABI 7900 Thermocycler, a real time PCR instrument used in AlloMap Heart, is no longer in production. Thermo Fisher has committed to provide service and support of this instrument through 2020. We believe that there are relatively few suppliers other than Thermo Fisher, Illumina, Becton, Dickinson and Company and Qiagen N.V. that are currently capable of supplying the instruments, reagents and other supplies necessary for our current products and services. Even if we were to identify secondary suppliers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into agreements with such suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms, if at all. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing from Thermo Fisher, Becton, Dickinson and Company or Therapak Corporation, or Therapak Corporation encounters delays or difficulties in securing from Qiagen N.V., the quality and quantity of reagents, supplies or instruments that we require for our current products and services or other solutions we develop, we may need to reconfigure our test processes, which would result in delays in commercialization or an interruption in sales. Clinicians and customers who order our current products and services rely on the continued and timely availability of our products and services. If we are unable to provide results within a timely manner, clinicians may elect not to use our products or services in the future and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nWe store sensitive intellectual property and other proprietary business information, including that of our customers, payers and collaboration partners. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing a combination of on-site systems, managed data center systems and cloud-based data center systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business critical information, including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information. We work with a third-party billing software to collect and store sensitive data, including legally-obtained-protected health information, credit card information and personally identifiable information about our customers, payers, recipients and collaboration partners. A data breach or loss of data could have a material adverse effect on our operations, including the potential for material fines and business interruption.\nWe face four primary risks relative to protecting critical information: loss of access risk, inappropriate disclosure risk, inappropriate modification risk and the risk of our being unable to identify and audit our controls over the first three risks.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store our critical information. Security breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure or modification of confidential information. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information are vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our third-party billing and collections provider, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.\nA security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to consumer information (including personally identifiable information or protected health information) could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with disparate state breach notification laws, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. If we are unable to prevent such security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive consumer data. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above.\nAny such breach or interruption could compromise our networks or those of our third-party billing agent, and the information stored there could be inaccessible or could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such\ninterruption in access, improper access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to perform tests, provide test results, bill our payers or patients, process claims and appeals, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare company financial information, provide information about our current and future products and solutions and other patient and clinician education and outreach efforts through our website, and manage the administrative aspects of our business, any of which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. Any such breach could also result in the compromise of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, requires covered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers concerning the collection and sale of personal information, and will give such consumers the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability, and we cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA on our business.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nAs part of our longer-term growth strategy, we intend to target select international markets to grow our presence outside of the U.S. We currently have a commercial agreement for the promotion of AlloMap Heart in Europe with Eurobio Scientific, or Eurobio (formerly known as Diaxonhit SA). We also currently distribute products directly in Germany, UK, New Zealand, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands and Australia and sell products via sub-distributors, in Canada and in significant markets in Europe such as France, Italy, UK and Turkey, and to certain countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. To promote the growth of our business internationally, we will need to attract additional partners to expand into new markets. Relying on partners for our sales and marketing subjects us to various risks, including:\n\u2022our partners may fail to commit the necessary resources to develop a market for our products, may spend the majority of their time selling products unrelated to ours, or may be unsuccessful in marketing our products for other reasons;\n\u2022under certain agreements, our partners\u2019 obligations, including their required level of promotional activities, may be conditioned upon our ability to achieve or maintain a specified level of reimbursement coverage;\n\u2022agreements with our partners may terminate prematurely due to disagreements or may result in disputes or litigation with our partners;\n\u2022we may not be able to renew existing partner agreements, or enter into new agreements, on acceptable terms;\n\u2022our existing relationships with partners may preclude us from entering into additional future arrangements;\n\u2022our partners may violate local laws or regulations, potentially causing reputational or monetary damage to our business;\n\u2022our partners may engage in sales practices that are locally acceptable but do not comply with standards required under U.S. laws that apply to us; and\n\u2022our partners may be negatively affected by the financial instability of, and austerity measures implemented by, the countries in which they operate.\nIf our present or future partners do not perform adequately, or we are unable to enter into agreements in new markets, we may be unable to achieve revenue growth or market acceptance in jurisdictions in which we depend on partners.\nIn addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks that, generally, we have not faced in the U.S., including:\n\u2022uncertain or changing regulatory registration and approval processes;\n\u2022failure by us to obtain regulatory approvals or adequate reimbursement for the use of our current and future solutions in various countries;\n\u2022competition from companies located in the countries in which we offer our products that may put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022financial risks, such as longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022logistics and regulations associated with shipping recipient samples, including infrastructure conditions and transportation delays;\n\u2022limits in our ability to penetrate international markets if we are not able to process solutions locally;\n\u2022difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and assuring compliance with foreign corrupt practices laws;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, tax inefficiencies related to our corporate structure and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as healthcare regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022the imposition of trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas, trade wars, preferential bidding or import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022political and economic instability, including interruptions in international relations, wars, terrorism and political unrest, general security concerns, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, its books and records provisions or its anti-bribery provisions, as well as risks associated with other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; and\n\u2022reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nThe occurrence of any one of the above could harm our business and, consequently, our revenues and results of operations. Our expanding international operations could be affected by changes in laws, trade regulations, labor and employment regulations, and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of our current and future products and solutions, as well as by inter-governmental disputes. Any of these changes could adversely affect our business. Additionally, operating internationally requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required in establishing operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nIn addition, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our distribution and sales activities.\nWe are also unable to predict how changing global economic conditions or potential global health concerns such as the COVID-19 coronavirus will affect our partners, suppliers and distributors. Any negative impact of such matters on our partners, suppliers or distributors may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur success expanding internationally will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that are effective in anticipating and managing these and other risks in the countries in which we do business. Failure to manage these and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business as a whole.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions.\nMany of the countries in which we operate, including the U.S. and several of the members of the European Union, or EU, have experienced and continue to experience uncertain economic conditions resulting from global as well as local factors. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom, or the UK, held a referendum pursuant to which voters elected to leave the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. Although the effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements between the UK and the EU, Brexit has created additional uncertainties that may ultimately result in new regulatory costs and challenges for companies and increased restrictions on imports and exports throughout Europe, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct and expand our operations in Europe and which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business or financial results may be adversely impacted by these uncertain economic conditions, including: adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, tax laws or tax rates; inflation; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or other economic conditions, which may potentially impair our ability to access the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all; and the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions. In addition, we cannot predict how future economic conditions will affect our critical customers, suppliers and distributors and any negative impact on our critical customers, suppliers or distributors may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Tax Act, was signed into law, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We calculated the impact of the Tax Act in our 2018 year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which did not result in any additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. The enactment of the Tax Act also requires companies to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and the retroactive effects of changes in tax laws in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. Consequently, we accounted for a provisional estimated reduction of the U.S. deferred tax assets from $72.5 million to approximately $45.9 million with a corresponding decrease of $27.0 million to our valuation allowance in 2018. We completed our analysis of the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018 with no change to our provisional estimates.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 also implemented global intangible low tax income, or GILTI, which is a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations as well as the new base erosion anti-abuse tax, or BEAT, under the Tax Act. GILTI will be effectively taxed at a tax rate of 10.5%. Due to the complexity of the GILTI tax rules, companies are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into a company\u2019s measurement of its deferred taxes. We have not made an election with respect to GILTI as it is not applicable to us in 2019. We will continue to review the GILTI and BEAT rules to determine their applicability to us and the impact that the rules may have on our results of operations of financial condition.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. For example, we do not carry earthquake insurance. In the event of a major earthquake in our region, our business could suffer significant and uninsured damage and loss. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, foreign liability, employee benefits liability, property, automobile, umbrella, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur activities currently require the use of hazardous chemicals. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products.\nWe may use third party collaborators to help us develop, validate or commercialize any new diagnostic solutions, and our ability to commercialize such solutions could be impaired or delayed if these collaborations are unsuccessful.\nWe may in the future selectively pursue strategic collaborations for the development, validation and commercialization of any new diagnostic solutions we may develop. In any future third party collaboration, we may be dependent upon the success of the collaborators in performing their responsibilities and their continued cooperation. Our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019 resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under our agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development, validation and commercialization of our potential solutions may be delayed if collaborators fail to fulfill their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us. Any issues arising from these arrangements will affect our ability to serve the entire region, and our reputation may suffer even if we subsequently locate new partners, which may permanently affect our business. Disputes with our collaborators could also impair our reputation or result in development delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting changes or require us to change our compensation policies.\nAccounting methods and policies for diagnostic companies, including policies governing revenue recognition, research and development and related expenses and accounting for stock-based compensation, are subject to further review, interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities, including the SEC. Changes to, or interpretations of, accounting methods or policies may require us to reclassify, restate or otherwise change or revise our consolidated financial statements, including those contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Any changes or modifications to the methodology used for determining our estimates, assumptions and forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions, Partnerships and Investments\nIntangibles, including goodwill, acquired in connection with acquisitions may subsequently be impaired and, if so, could increase our net accumulated deficit.\nUnder United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable; specifically, we are required to evaluate whether the intangible assets and goodwill as a result of an acquisition continue to have a fair value that meets or exceeds the amounts recorded on our balance sheet. We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually and more frequently if impairment indicators are present. If the fair values of such assets decline below their carrying value on the balance sheet, we may be required to recognize an impairment charge related to such decline.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we are also required to evaluate finite-lived intangible assets, which are long-lived assets, for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. Finite-lived intangible assets are intangible assets that we are amortizing over their estimated useful lives. If recoverability is in question, we would then compare the carrying amounts of the intangible assets with the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the intangible asset over the asset\u2019s fair value determined using discounted estimates of future cash flows.\nLower than expected revenue growth, a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance, a decline in our market capitalization for a sustained period of time, unfavorable changes in market or economic and industry conditions all could significantly impact our impairment analysis. If we determine an impairment exists, we may be required to recognize further impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our business with the business of Ottr Complete Transplant Management, or OttrCare, or XynManagement, Inc., or XynManagement, and we may not be able to achieve the anticipated strategic benefits from our acquisition of OttrCare.\nThe integration of OttrCare, XynManagement and any other businesses or assets we may acquire will be a time-consuming process. The integration process will require substantial management time and attention, which may divert attention and resources from other important areas, including our existing business. In addition, we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated strategic benefits of any such combination, which includes, with respect to OttrCare, the complementary Ottr software, and, with respect to XynManagement, XynQAPI, and in each case significant cross-selling opportunities. The failure to successfully integrate the combined operations, including retention of key employees, could impact our ability to realize the\nfull benefits of our acquisition of OttrCare, XynManagement or any other businesses or assets we may acquire. If we are not able to achieve the anticipated strategic benefits of any such combination, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock if the integration or the anticipated financial and strategic benefits of the acquisition are not realized as rapidly as, or to the extent anticipated by investors and analysts. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs and decreases in future revenue and/or net income following the acquisition.\nOur License and Commercialization Agreement with Illumina may not result in material benefits to our business.\nUnder the License and Commercialization Agreement, or the License Agreement, with Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, we are obligated to complete timely development and commercialization of future products, including meeting certain commercialization milestones. The failure to meet any such milestones could result in the loss of exclusivity for the affected licensed products. Additionally, we agreed to minimum purchase commitments of finished products and raw materials from Illumina through 2023 and we are required to pay royalties in the mid-single to low-double digits on sales of future commercialized products.\nWe cannot make any assurances that our efforts under the License Agreement will be successful. As a result, we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated strategic benefits of the License Agreement. If we fail to successfully execute on the License Agreement, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\nOur License and Commercialization Agreement, or Cibiltech Agreement, with Cibiltech SAS, or Cibiltech, may not result in material benefits to our business.\nThe Cibiltech Agreement provides us an exclusive right to commercialize its proprietary software KidneyCare iBox. We have not yet made any applications to payers for reimbursement coverage of KidneyCare iBox. The failure to obtain reimbursement coverage from payers for KidneyCare iBox could result in material amounts of revenue not being recognized, and failure to successfully integrate predictive artificial intelligence technology with our existing tests.\nRisks Related to Billing and Reimbursement\nBilling complexities associated with obtaining payment or reimbursement for our current and future solutions may negatively affect our revenue, cash flows and profitability.\nBilling for clinical laboratory testing services is complex. In cases where we do not have a contract in place requiring the payment of a fixed fee per test, we perform tests in advance of payment and without certainty as to the outcome of the billing process. In cases where we do receive a fixed fee per test, we may still have disputes over pricing and billing. We receive payment from individual recipients and from a variety of payers, such as commercial insurance carriers and governmental programs, primarily Medicare. Each payer typically has different billing requirements. Among the factors complicating our billing of third-party payers are:\n\u2022disputes among payers regarding which party is responsible for payment;\n\u2022disparity in coverage among various payers;\n\u2022different process, information and billing requirements among payers; and\n\u2022incorrect or missing billing information, which is required to be provided by the prescribing clinician.\nAdditionally, from time to time, payers change processes that may affect timely payment. For example, some commercial payers have instituted prior authorization requirements before our testing is performed. These changes may result in uneven cash flow or impact the timing of revenue recognized with these payers. With respect to payments received from governmental programs, factors such as a prolonged government shutdown could cause significant regulatory delays or could result in attempts to reduce payments made to us by federal government healthcare programs. In addition, payers may refuse to ultimately make payment if their processes and requirements have not been met on a timely basis. These billing complexities, and the resulting uncertainty in obtaining payment for AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart and future solutions, could negatively affect our revenue, cash flows and profitability.\nHealth insurers and other third-party payers may decide to revoke coverage of our existing test, decide not to cover our future solutions or may provide inadequate reimbursement, which could jeopardize our commercial prospects.\nSuccessful commercialization of AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart depends, in large part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and private payers. Favorable third-party payer coverage and reimbursement are essential to meeting our immediate objectives and long-term commercial goals.\nFor new diagnostic testing services, each private and government payer decides whether to cover the test, the amount it will reimburse for a covered test and the specific conditions for reimbursement. Clinicians and recipients may be likely not to order a diagnostic test unless third-party payers pay a substantial portion of the test price. Therefore, coverage determinations and reimbursement levels and conditions are critical to the commercial success of a diagnostic testing service, and if we are not able to secure positive coverage determinations and reimbursement levels, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nCoverage and reimbursement by a commercial payer may depend on a number of factors, including a payer\u2019s determination that our current and future testing services are:\n\u2022not experimental or investigational;\n\u2022medically necessary;\n\u2022lead to improved patient outcomes;\n\u2022appropriate for the specific recipient;\n\u2022cost-saving or cost-effective; and\n\u2022supported by peer-reviewed publications.\nIn addition, several payers and other entities conduct technology assessments of new medical tests and devices and provide and/or sell the results of their assessments to other parties. These assessments may be used by third-party payers and healthcare providers as grounds to deny coverage for or refuse to use a test or procedure. We believe we have received a negative technology assessment from at least one of these entities and could receive more.\nIf third-party payers decide not to cover our diagnostic testing services or if they offer inadequate payment amounts, our ability to generate revenue from AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart and future solutions could be limited. Payment for diagnostic tests furnished to Medicare beneficiaries is typically made based on a fee schedule set by CMS. In recent years, payments under these fee schedules have decreased and may decrease further. Any third-party payer may stop or lower payment at any time, which could substantially reduce our revenue. See the risk factor above titled \u201cWe receive a substantial portion of our revenues from Medicare, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, reimbursement from Medicare would severely and adversely affect our financial performance\u201d.\nSince each payer makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy to reimburse for a test, seeking payer coverage and other approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. We cannot be certain that adequate coverage and reimbursement for AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart, or future solutions will be provided in the future by any third-party payer.\nReimbursement for AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart comes primarily from Medicare and private third party payers such as insurance companies and managed care organizations. The reimbursement process can take six months or more to complete depending on the payer. Coverage policies approving AlloMap Heart have been adopted by many of the largest private payers, including Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Health Care Services Corporation, Humana, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., and UnitedHealthcare. Many of the payers with positive coverage policies have also entered into contracts with us to formalize pricing and payment terms. We continue to work with third-party payers to expand and seek such coverage and to appeal denial decisions based on existing and ongoing studies, peer reviewed publications, support from physician and patient groups and the growing number of AlloMap Heart tests that have been reimbursed by public and private payers. There are no assurances that the current policies will not be modified in the future. If our test is considered on a policy-wide level by major third-party payers, whether at our request or on their own initiative, and our test is determined to be ineligible for coverage and reimbursement by such payers, our collection efforts and potential for revenue growth could be adversely impacted.\nOur Medicare Part B coverage for AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart is included in a formal local coverage decision for molecular diagnostics. However, any change in this coverage decision or other future adverse coverage decisions by the CMS, including with respect to coding, could substantially reduce our revenue.\nMedicare reimbursements currently comprise a significant portion of our revenue. Our current Medicare Part B reimbursement was not set pursuant to a national coverage determination by CMS. Although we believe that coverage is available under Medicare Part B even without such a determination, we currently lack the national coverage certainty afforded by a formal coverage determination by CMS. This means that Medicare contractors, including our California Medicare contractor, currently may continue to develop their own coverage and reimbursement policies with respect to our technology.\nUntil 2016, AlloMap Heart was billed using an unlisted Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code, but in 2016 a new CPT Category 1 Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses, or MAAA, code was added that specifically describes the test. Further, pursuant to MolDX billing requirements, the AlloMap Heart test also has been assigned a McKesson Diagnostics Z code\u2122, which is included on all Medicare claims. If in the future CMS makes a determination not to pay for this code, or for any MAAA codes, this could be harmful to our business, and could have negative spillover implications that prevent or limit coverage by other third-party payers that might mirror aspects of Medicare payment criteria.\nSince the launch of AlloSure Kidney in October 2016, and at the instruction of the MolDX Program of Palmetto, the test has been billed utilizing an unlisted CPT code. If in the future CMS makes a determination to no longer provide coverage for services billed with an unlisted CPT code, our ability to bill and obtain reimbursement from public and private payers could be negatively impacted.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart.\nThe pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging as a result of any of several possible regulatory developments, including policies advanced by the U.S. government, new healthcare legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. Specifically, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to profitably sell any diagnostic products we may develop and commercialize. Some of these proposed and implemented reforms could result in reduced reimbursement rates for our diagnostic products from governmental agencies or other third-party payers, which would adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results. For example, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010), or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, substantial changes have been made and may continue to be made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the U.S., including changes made in order to extend medical benefits to those who currently lack insurance coverage. The Affordable Care Act also provided that payments under the Medicare CLFS were to receive a negative 1.75% annual adjustment through 2015. Although we have not been subject to such adjustment in the past, we cannot be certain that the claims administrators will not attempt to apply this adjustment in the future.\nAmong other things, the Affordable Care Act includes payment reductions to Medicare Advantage plans. These cuts have been mitigated in part by a CMS demonstration program that expired in 2015. We cannot be assured that future cuts would be mitigated by CMS. Any reductions in payment to Medicare Advantage plans could materially impact coverage and reimbursement for AlloMap Heart.\nIn addition to the Affordable Care Act, various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged from federal and state governments. For example, in February 2012, Congress passed the \u201cMiddle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012\u201d, which in part reduced the potential future cost-based increases to the Medicare CLFS by 2%. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 introduced a multi-year phase in of a new payment system for services paid under the CLFS. Under this new system, beginning in 2017 laboratories began reporting to CMS the payment rates paid to the laboratories by commercial third-party payers including Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans, for each test and the volume of each test performed. CMS began using the reported data to set new payment rates under the CLFS in 2018. For most tests, rates will only be adjusted every three years. For newly developed tests that are considered to be \u201cadvanced diagnostic lab tests,\u201d the Medicare payment rate will be the actual list price offered to third-party payers for the first three quarters that the tests are offered, subject to later adjustment. CMS will establish subsequent payment rates using the commercial third-party payer data reported for those tests.\nThere have been recent public announcements by members of the U.S. Congress and President Trump and his administration regarding their plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. We cannot predict the ultimate form or timing of any repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act or the effect such repeal or replacement would have on our business. Regardless of the impact of any or repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act on us, the government has shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform and reducing healthcare costs. Any government-adopted reform measures could decrease the amount of reimbursement available from governmental and other third-party payers. On April 1, 2013, cuts to the federal budget resulting from sequestration were implemented, requiring a 2% cut in Medicare payment for all services, including AlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart, and is expected to remain in effect through at least 2025. Federal budgetary limitations and changes in healthcare policy, such as the creation of broad limits for diagnostic products or requirements that Medicare\npatients pay for portions of clinical laboratory tests or services received, could substantially diminish the sale, or inhibit the utilization, of AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart and our future diagnostic solutions, increase costs, divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability.\nRisks Related to the Healthcare Regulatory Environment\nIn order to operate our laboratory, we have to comply with the CLIA and state laws governing clinical laboratories.\nWe are subject to the CLIA, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens taken from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. If our laboratory is out of compliance with the CLIA requirements, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, as well as a direct plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties. We must maintain the CLIA compliance and certification to be eligible to bill for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. If we were to be found to be out of compliance with the CLIA program requirements and subjected to sanction, our business could be materially harmed.\nLicensure is also required for our laboratory under California law in order to conduct testing. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. Moreover, several states, including New York, require that we hold licenses to test specimens from patients residing in those states. Other states have similar requirements or may adopt similar requirements in the future. In addition to our California certifications, we currently hold licenses in Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The loss of any of these state certifications would impact our ability to provide services in those states, which could negatively affect our business. Finally, we may be subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions where we offer our test. Failure to maintain certification in those states or countries where it is required could prevent us from testing samples from those states or countries, could lead to the suspension or loss of licenses, certificates or authorizations, and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe were inspected as part of the customary College of American Pathologists audit and recertified in February 2018 as a result of passing that inspection. We expect the next regular inspection under the CLIA to occur in 2020. If we were to lose our CLIA accreditation or California license, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to perform AlloMap Heart or AlloSure Kidney, which would limit our revenues and materially harm our business. If we were to lose our license in other states where we are required to hold licenses, we would not be able to test specimens from those states, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FDA has traditionally chosen not to exercise its authority to regulate laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, because it believes that laboratories certified as high complexity under the CLIA, such as ours, have demonstrated expertise and ability in test procedures and analysis. However, beginning in September 2006, the FDA issued draft guidance on a subset of LDTs known as \u201cin vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays,\u201d or IVDMIAs. According to the draft guidance, IVDMIAs do not fall within the scope of LDTs over which the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion because such tests incorporate complex and unique interpretation functions, which require clinical validation. We believed that AlloMap Heart met the definition of IVDMIA set forth in the draft guidance document. As a result, we applied for, and obtained in August 2008, 510(k) clearance for AlloMap Heart for marketing and sale as a test to aid in the identification of recipients with a low probability of moderate or severe rejection. A 510(k) submission is a premarketing submission made to the FDA. Clearance may be granted by the FDA if it finds the device or test provides satisfactory evidence pertaining to the claimed intended uses and indications for the device or test.\nWhile we believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to our LDTs, we cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies would agree with our determination. A determination that we have violated these laws, or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violation of these laws, could hurt our business and our reputation.\nIf we were required to conduct additional clinical trials prior to marketing our solutions under development, those trials could lead to delays or a failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and harm our ability to be profitable.\nIf the FDA or Congress decide to regulate AlloSure Kidney and other future solutions under development as medical devices, we could be required to conduct additional premarket clinical testing subsequent to commercialization in the case of AlloSure Kidney and/or conduct premarket clinical testing prior to submitting a regulatory application for commercial sales for future products not yet developed. If we are required to conduct premarket clinical trials, whether using prospectively acquired samples or archival samples, delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly increase our development costs and delay test commercialization and also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or\napproval. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient blood or tissue samples or insufficient data regarding the associated clinical outcomes. We may find it necessary to engage contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical trials, which might increase the cost and complexity of our trials and reduce our control over such activities. If these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, applicable regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may have to be extended, delayed or terminated. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or considerable expenditures. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these parties on favorable terms, if at all. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our solutions under development and our ability to be profitable.\nAny test for which we obtain regulatory clearance will be subject to extensive ongoing regulatory requirements, and we may be subject to penalties if we or our contractors or commercial partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAlloSure Kidney and AlloMap Heart, and our other products and solutions, along with the manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling, distribution, import, export, and advertising and promotional activities for such products and solutions, are or will be subject to continual requirements of, and review by, CMS, state licensing agencies, the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements relating to product labeling, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and adverse event reporting. Regulatory clearance of a test or device may be subject to limitations by the regulatory body as to the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to other conditions of approval. For example, we are exploring utilization of AlloMap Heart in areas that could be considered outside the scope of our current labeling. Broader uses would require FDA clearance as well as changes to the labeling. In addition, clearance may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the test or device. Discovery of previously-unknown problems with our current or future solutions, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u2022restrictions on operations of our laboratory;\n\u2022restrictions on manufacturing processes;\n\u2022restrictions on marketing of a test;\n\u2022warning or untitled letters;\n\u2022withdrawal of the test from the market;\n\u2022refusal to approve applications or supplements to approved applications that we may submit;\n\u2022fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022suspension, limitation or withdrawal of regulatory clearances;\n\u2022exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022product seizure;\n\u2022injunctions; and\n\u2022imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to numerous fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations pertaining to our business, the violation of any one of which could harm our business.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is highly regulated, and there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly and adversely in the future. Our arrangements with customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations that may restrict the financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. Our employees, consultants, principal investigators and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements. In addition to the CLIA regulation, other federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to conduct business, include, without limitation:\n\u2022federal and state laws and regulations regarding billing and claims payment applicable to clinical laboratories and/or regulatory agencies enforcing those laws and regulations;\n\u2022federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to the government, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which constrains our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity for certain designated health services, including clinical laboratory services, reimbursed by Medicare if the physician (or a member of the physician\u2019s family) has a financial relationship with the entity, and which also prohibits the submission of any claims for reimbursement for designated health services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; HIPAA also created criminal liability for knowingly and willfully falsifying or concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022state laws regarding prohibitions on fee-splitting;\n\u2022the federal healthcare program exclusion statute; and\n\u2022state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback, false claims, and self-referral laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action brought against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. We may be subject to private \u201cqui tam\u201d actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments, with potential liability under the federal False Claims Act, including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state and foreign laws described above or any other current or future fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment for individuals, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.\nForeign governments may impose reimbursement standards, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWhen we market our products and our solutions under development in foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. In some foreign countries, including countries in the EU, the reimbursement of our current and future solutions is subject to governmental control. In these countries, reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a test candidate. If reimbursement of our future solutions in any jurisdiction is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if reimbursement rates are set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to, or decide not to, market our test in that jurisdiction.\nChanges in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions.\nChanges in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future solutions. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act became law. This law substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and contained a number of provisions that have impacted our business and operations, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse enforcement. Further, our combination with Allenex will also change how these provisions could impact our business.\nPAMA includes a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenues from payments made under the CLFS report initially and then on a subsequent three-year basis thereafter (or annually for ADLTs), private payer payment rates and volumes for their tests. The new PAMA rules took effect January 1, 2018 and used the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for the tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payer payment rates for the tests.\nIn addition to the Affordable Care Act, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payers to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our current and future solutions or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future solutions from governmental agencies or third-party payers. While in general it is difficult to predict specifically what effects the Affordable Care Act or any future healthcare reform legislation or policies will have on our business, current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur competitive position depends on maintaining intellectual property protection.\nOur ability to compete and to achieve and maintain profitability depends on our ability to protect our proprietary discoveries and technologies. We currently rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur patent position for AlloMap Heart is based on issued patents and patent applications disclosing identification of genes differentially expressed between activated and resting leukocytes and demonstration of correlation between gene expression patterns and specific clinical states and outcomes. As of December 31, 2019, we had 25 issued U.S. patents related to transplant rejection and autoimmunity. We have five issued U.S. patents covering methods of diagnosing transplant rejection using all 11 informative genes measured in AlloMap Heart. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2021 to 2024. We have five additional patents covering additional genes or gene variants for diagnosing transplant rejection.\nIn connection with our June 2014 acquisition of ImmuMetrix, Inc., we obtained an exclusive license from Stanford to a U.S. patent relating to the diagnosis of rejection in organ transplant recipients using dd-cfDNA. This patent has an expiration date of November 5, 2030. A second patent included in the license from Stanford was issued in December 2017 and further covers the use of dd-cfDNA to diagnose and predict transplant status or outcome. A third and fourth patent were issued from this Stanford set in June 2019 and December 2019, respectively, covering the use of dd-cfDNA to diagnose and predict transplant status or outcome. Both patents have the same expiration 2030 date as the original Stanford patent.\nAs part of our April 2016 acquisition of Allenex, we obtained an additional five U.S. patents on donor matching technology treatment for antibody mediated transplant rejection.\nOur patents and the patents we exclusively license from others may be successfully challenged by third parties as being invalid or unenforceable. Third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids the patents we own or exclusively license. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation and use of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.\nThe extent to which the patent rights of life sciences companies effectively protect their products and technologies is often highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the proper scope of allowable claims of patents held by such companies has emerged to date in the United States. Various courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have rendered decisions that impact the scope of patentability of certain inventions or discoveries relating to diagnostic solutions or genomic diagnostics. In the Ariosa\nDiagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. (Fed. Cir. 2015) case, a federal court recently determined that a dd-cfDNA product for fetal testing was not eligible for patent protection. These decisions generally stand for the proposition that inventions that recite laws of nature are not themselves patentable unless they have sufficient additional features that provide practical assurance that the processes are genuine inventive applications of those laws rather than patent drafting efforts designed to monopolize a law of nature itself. What constitutes a \u201csufficient\u201d additional feature for this purpose is uncertain. This evolving case law in the United States may adversely impact our ability to obtain new patents and may facilitate third-party challenges to our existing owned and exclusively licensed patents.\nChanges in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property rights. In particular, in September 2011, the United States Congress passed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the AIA, which became effective in March 2013. The AIA reforms United States patent law in part by changing the standard for patent approval for certain patents from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d standard to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d standard and developing a post-grant review system. This has not yet had a material impact on the operation of our business and the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property, but it may in the future. The AIA and its implementation could still increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are not published until at least eighteen months after filing, and it is possible for a patent application filed in the United States to be maintained in secrecy until a patent is issued on the application. In addition, publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries. We therefore cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications that cover inventions that are the subject of pending applications that we own or exclusively license or that we or our licensors, as applicable, were the first to invent the technology (pre-AIA) or first to file (post-AIA). Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology that is similar to or the same as our technology. Any such patent application may have priority over patent applications that we own or exclusively license and, if a patent issues on such patent application, we could be required to obtain a license to such patent in order to carry on our business. If another party has filed a United States patent application covering an invention that is similar to, or the same as, an invention that we own or license, we or our licensors may have to participate in an interference or other proceeding in the PTO or a court to determine priority of invention in the United States for pre-AIA applications and patents. For post-AIA applications and patents, we or our licensors may have to participate in a derivation proceeding to resolve disputes relating to inventorship. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in our inability to obtain or retain any United States patent rights with respect to such invention.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nWe may in the future receive offers to license patents or notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. We may also initiate claims to defend our intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is unpredictable, expensive and time-consuming, could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent) to the party claiming infringement, develop non-infringing technology, stop selling our test or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm our business. In addition, revising our current or future solutions to exclude any infringing technologies would require us to re-validate the test, which would be costly and time consuming. Also, we may be unaware of pending patent applications that relate to our current or future solutions. Parties making infringement claims on future issued patents may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent us from selling our current or future solutions or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could harm our business. See the risk factor above titled: \u201cWe could become subject to legal proceedings that could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and settlements/judgments, require significant amounts of management attention and result in the diversion of significant operational resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nWe may be required to take further action to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights against third parties.\nIn the event we determine that a party is infringing our intellectual property rights, we may try to negotiate a license arrangement with such party or we may determine to initiate a lawsuit against such party. The process of negotiating a license with a third party can be lengthy, and may take months or even years in some circumstances. In addition, it is possible that third parties who we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights are unwilling to license our intellectual property from us on terms we can accept, or at all.\nThe decision to commence litigation over infringement of a patent is complex and may lead to several risks to us, including the following, among others:\n\u2022the time, significant expense and distraction to management of managing such litigation;\n\u2022the uncertainty of litigation and its potential outcomes;\n\u2022the possibility that in the course of such litigation, the defendant may challenge the validity of our patents, which could result in a re-examination or post grant review of our patents and the possibility that the claims in our patents may be limited in scope or invalidated altogether;\n\u2022the potential that the defendant may successfully persuade a court that their technology or products do not infringe our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022the impact of such litigation on other licensing relationships we have or seek to establish, including the timing of renewing or entering into such relationships, as applicable, as well as the terms of such relationships;\n\u2022the potential that a defendant may assert counterclaims against us; and\n\u2022adverse publicity to us or harm to relationships we have with customers or others.\nIf we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights effectively in all major markets, our business would be harmed.\nFiling, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patents on all of our technologies and solutions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. As a result, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and in select foreign jurisdictions and cannot guarantee that we will obtain the patent protection necessary to protect our competitive position in all major markets. Competitors may use our technologies or solutions in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our current and future products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents, and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Further, the legal systems of certain countries make it difficult or impossible to obtain patent protection for diagnostic solutions. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and could divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technologies and solutions, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. However, we cannot be certain that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult and we do not know whether the procedures we have followed to prevent such disclosure are, or will be adequate. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the U.S. may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of the technology or information that we protect as trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest, and our business may be adversely affected.\nAlloMap, AlloSure, Olerup SSP, Olerup XM-ONE, QTYPE, Ottr and CareDx are registered trademarks of our company in the United States. Our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. As a means to enforce our trademark rights and prevent infringement, we may be required to file trademark claims against third parties or initiate trademark opposition proceedings. This process can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a trademark of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the trademark at issue. We may not be able to protect our rights to these and other trademarks and trade names which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. Over the long-term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or misappropriated intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we view as our own intellectual property.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other diagnostics, medical device, life sciences or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information of others in the course of their work for us and no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. We may also be forced to bring claims against third parties or defend against third-party claims in order to determine the ownership of our intellectual property. An adverse result in the prosecution or defense of any such claims could require us to pay substantial monetary damages and could result in the loss of valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nOur business is dependent on licenses from third parties.\nWe license technology from third parties necessary to develop and commercialize our products. In connection with our acquisition of ImmuMetrix, Inc., we obtained an exclusive license from Stanford to a patent relating to the diagnosis of rejection in organ transplant recipients using dd-cfDNA. This technology is critical to AlloSure Kidney under the terms of the Stanford license, we are required to report and pay an annual license maintenance fee, six milestone payments and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products incorporating the licensed technology. This patent has an expiration date of November 5, 2030. A second patent included in the license from Stanford was issued in December 2017 and further covers the use of dd-cfDNA to diagnose and predict transplant status or outcome. A third and fourth patent was issued from this Stanford set in June 2019 and December 2019, respectively, covering the use of dd-cfDNA to diagnose and predict transplant status or outcome. Both patents have the same 2030 expiration date as the original Stanford patent.\nOn May 4, 2018, we entered into the License Agreement with Illumina, which provides us with worldwide distribution, development and commercialization rights to Illumina\u2019s NGS product line for use in transplantation diagnostic testing. As a result, on June 1, 2018, we became the exclusive worldwide distributor of Illumina\u2019s TruSight HLA product line.\nOn April 30, 2019, we entered into the Cibiltech Agreement, pursuant to which we were granted an irrevocable, non-transferable right to commercialize Cibiltech\u2019s proprietary software, KidneyCare iBox, for the predictive analysis of post-transplantation kidney allograft loss in the field of transplantation in the U.S. for a period of ten years.\nOur rights to use this and other licensed technologies, data and materials and to employ the inventions claimed in licensed patents are subject to the continuation of and our compliance with the terms of the applicable licenses.\nTermination of the license could prevent us from producing or selling some or all of our products. Failure of a licensor to abide by the terms of a license or to prevent infringement by third parties could also harm our business and negatively impact our market position.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decrease.\nFluctuations in our operating results may lead to fluctuations, including declines, in the share price for our common stock. In 2019, our closing stock price ranged from $19.24 to $40.08 per share. Our operating results and our share price may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022demand by clinicians and recipients for our current and future solutions, if any;\n\u2022coverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payers and announcements of those decisions;\n\u2022clinical trial results and publication of results in peer-reviewed journals or the presentation at medical conferences;\n\u2022the inclusion or exclusion of our current and future solutions in large clinical trials conducted by others;\n\u2022new or less expensive tests and services or new technology introduced or offered by our competitors or us;\n\u2022the level of our development activity conducted for new solutions, and our success in commercializing these developments;\n\u2022our ability to efficiently integrate the business of new acquisitions;\n\u2022the level of our spending on test commercialization efforts, licensing and acquisition initiatives, clinical trials, and internal research and development;\n\u2022changes in the regulatory environment, including any announcement from the FDA regarding its decisions in regulating our activities;\n\u2022changes in recommendations of securities analysts or lack of analyst coverage;\n\u2022failure to meet analyst expectations regarding our operating results;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022general market conditions.\nVariations in the timing of our future revenues and expenses could also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated earning shortfalls or losses. In addition, national stock exchanges, and in particular the market for life science companies, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Moreover, we may be subject to additional securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Market, but we can provide no assurances that there will be active trading on that market or on any other market in the future. If there is no active market or if the volume of trading is limited, holders of our common stock may have difficulty selling their shares. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of life sciences stocks;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other life sciences companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022entering into financing or other arrangements with rights or terms senior to the interests of common stockholders;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or failure to meet those projections;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services;\n\u2022the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022any significant change in our management; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIf our principal stockholders, executive officers and directors choose to act together, they may be able to control our management and operations, which may prevent us from taking actions that may be favorable to you.\nOur executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock, and entities affiliated with them, beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 30.26% of our common stock as of December 31, 2019. These stockholders, acting together, will have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, they could dictate the management of our business and affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to you.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or sales of our common stock by our executive officers and directors under Rule 10b5-1 plans, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe currently have effective registration statements registering shares of our common stock for resale, and such shares are currently freely tradable in the public market. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. In addition, our executive officers and directors may adopt written plans, known as \u201cRule 10b5-1 Plans,\u201d under which they will contract with a broker to sell shares of our common stock on a periodic basis to diversify their assets and investments. Sales made by our executive officers and directors pursuant to Rule 10b5-1, regardless of the amount of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the U.S., which may adversely affect our operating results.\nAs a public company listed in the U.S., we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed.\nFurther, if we fail to comply with these laws, regulations and standards, it might also be more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make\nit more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. Securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock and a lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you must rely on stock appreciation for any return on your investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will also depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, you will have to rely on capital appreciation, if any, to earn a return on your investment in our common stock.\nIf we are unable to substantially utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, our financial results could be harmed.\nSection 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally limits the ability of a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating loss carry-forwards, or NOLs, and certain other tax attributes against any taxable income in taxable periods after the ownership change. The amount of taxable income in each taxable year after the ownership change that may be offset by pre-change NOLs and certain other pre-change tax attributes is generally equal to the product of (a) the fair market value of the corporation\u2019s outstanding shares (or, in the case of a foreign corporation, the fair market value of items treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States) immediately prior to the ownership change and (b) the long-term tax exempt rate (i.e., a rate of interest established by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, that fluctuates from month to month). In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs whenever the percentage of the shares of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the shares of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d at any time over the preceding three years.\nBased on a preliminary review of our equity transactions since inception, we believe a portion of our NOLs may be limited due to the equity financings that we have completed. Utilization of our NOLs may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause U.S. federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs before they expire. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs.\nOur financial controls and procedures may not be sufficient to ensure timely and reliable reporting of financial information, which could materially harm our stock price, exchange listing and our ability to finance our operations.\nWe are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, including expanded disclosures and accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, and other requirements will increase our costs and require additional management resources. Pursuant to Section 404, we are required to, among other things, file a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. We are continuing to implement and update new finance and accounting systems as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy internal control and reporting requirements. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe effectiveness of our controls and procedures may in the future be limited by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022faulty human judgment and simple errors, omissions or mistakes;\n\u2022fraudulent action of an individual or collusion of two or more people;\n\u2022inappropriate management override of procedures; and\n\u2022the possibility that any enhancements to controls and procedures may still not be adequate to assure timely and accurate financial information.\nIf we are unable to complete the required Section 404 assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting or otherwise fail to maintain or implement effective controls and procedures for financial reporting, we could be unable to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows or key operating metrics, which could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, restatements of our consolidated financial statements or other corrective disclosures, a decline in our stock price, suspension or delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market, SEC investigations, civil or criminal sanctions, an inability to access the capital and commercial lending markets, defaults under our debt and other agreements or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nOur organizational documents and Delaware law make a takeover of our company more difficult, which may prevent certain changes in control and limit the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or Section 203, contain provisions that may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, engage in proxy contests and effect changes in control. These provisions include:\n\u2022our board of directors is authorized, without prior stockholder approval, to create and issue preferred stock which could be used to implement anti-takeover devices;\n\u2022advance notice is required for director nominations or for proposals that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022our board of directors is classified such that not all members of our board are elected at one time, which may make it more difficult for a person who acquires control of a majority of our outstanding voting stock to replace all or a majority of our directors;\n\u2022stockholder action by written consent is prohibited;\n\u2022special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, a majority of our board of directors or by our chief executive officer or president (if at such time we have no chief executive officer);\n\u2022stockholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors; and\n\u2022stockholders may amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation only upon receiving at least 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware law, including Section 203. In general, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in Section 203. These provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us, which may limit the market price of our common stock.\nTechniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own, but rather has borrowed from a third-party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock\nshort. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market. We believe that our securities have in the past been, and may continue to be, the subject of short selling. Reports and information have been published about us that we believe are mischaracterized or incorrect, and which have in the past been followed by a decline in our stock price.\nIt is not clear what additional effects the negative publicity will have on us, if any, other than potentially affecting the market price of our common stock. If we continue to be the subject of unfavorable allegations, we may have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by applicable state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could be distracting for our management team. Additionally, such allegations against us could negatively impact our business operations and stockholders' equity, and the value of any investment in our stock could be reduced.", "PERMNO": 14797, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "CDNA"}
