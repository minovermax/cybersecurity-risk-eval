{"cik": "1035748", "company": "CALLIDUS SOFTWARE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFactors That Could Affect Future Results\nYou should carefully consider the risks below, as well as other information included or incorporated by reference in this report before making an investment decision. We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from results contemplated by forward-looking statements in this report. Because of the factors discussed below, other information included or incorporated by reference in this report and other factors affecting our operating results, past performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance. The risks discussed in this report are not the only risks we face. Risks and uncertainties of which we are not currently aware, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses, and we intend to continue to invest in our business, so we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of $19.0 million in 2016, $13.1 million in 2015, and $11.6 million in 2014. We had an accumulated deficit of $302.8 million as of December 31, 2016. We intend to continue to invest in our business, including with respect to our employee base; sales and marketing efforts; development of new products, services, and features; and improvement of our existing products, services, and features. Therefore, to achieve profitability, we must increase our revenue, particularly our recurring revenue by entering into more and larger sales transactions while limiting customer churn, and manage our cost structure in line with our revenue. If we fail to do so, our future results and financial condition will be adversely affected and we may be unable to continue operating.\nWe continue to monitor and manage our costs in an effort to optimize our performance for the long term. However, there is no assurance that we will succeed and unforeseen expenses, difficulties or delays may prevent us from realizing our goals. From time to time, we incur restructuring expenses or expenses related to cost reduction efforts, but we can offer no assurance that these or other actions will enable us to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. In addition, we cannot be certain that steps we have taken to control our costs will not adversely affect our prospects for long-term revenue growth. If we cannot increase our revenue, improve gross margins and control costs, our future results and financial condition will be negatively affected.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, and because we recognize revenue from subscriptions over a period of time, downturns in revenue may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nBecause we recognize recurring revenue and maintenance revenue ratably over the terms of the related subscription agreements and maintenance support agreements, most of our revenue each quarter results from recognition of deferred revenue related to agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, declines in new or renewed subscription agreements and maintenance agreements, or termination of existing subscription agreements and maintenance agreements that occur in one quarter will be felt in both the immediate quarter and future quarters, both because we may be unable to generate sufficient new revenue to offset the decline and we may be unable to adjust our operating costs and capital expenditures to align with the revenue reductions. Our subscription model makes it more difficult for us to increase our revenue rapidly, because revenue from new customers is recognized over multiple periods. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as definitive indicators of future performance. Other factors that may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\ntiming of customer budget cycles;\n\u2022\nthe priority our customers place on our products compared to other business investments;\n\u2022\nsize, timing and contract terms of new customer contracts, and unpredictable and often lengthy sales cycles;\n\u2022\nreduced renewals of subscription and maintenance agreements;\n\u2022\ncompetitive factors, including new product introductions, upgrades and discounted pricing or special payment terms offered by our competitors, as well as strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties, errors or service interruptions in our solutions that may cause customer dissatisfaction with our solutions;\n\u2022\nconsolidation among our customers, which may alter their buying patterns, or business failures that may reduce demand for our solutions;\n\u2022\noperating expenses associated with expansion of our sales force or business and our product development efforts;\n\u2022\ncost, timing and management efforts related to the introduction of new features to our solutions;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and adequately safeguard the information imported into our solutions or otherwise provided to us by our customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment, including with respect to security, or privacy laws and regulations, or their enforcement; and\n\u2022\nextraordinary expenses such as impairment charges, litigation or other payments related to settlement of disputes.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In such cases, we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers. In the future, we may have to record additional reserves or write-offs, or defer revenue on sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nIf we are unable to maintain the profitability of our recurring revenue solutions, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial resources to expand, market and refine our recurring revenue solutions. If we are unable to grow our recurring revenue, or to improve our recurring revenue gross margins, we may not be able to achieve profitability and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Factors that could harm our ability to improve these gross margins include:\n\u2022\ncustomer attrition as customers decide not to renew for any reason;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain or increase the prices customers pay for our solutions, due to competitive pricing pressures or limited demand;\n\u2022\nour inability to reduce operating costs through technology-based efficiencies and streamlined processes;\n\u2022\nincreased direct and indirect cost of third-party services, including hosting facilities and professional services contractors performing implementation and support services;\n\u2022\nhigher personnel and personnel-related costs;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to integrate products or personnel that we acquire, including time and expense associated with new sales personnel reaching full productivity; and\n\u2022\nincreased costs to license and maintain and replace third-party software embedded in our solutions or to create alternatives to such third-party software.\nOur business and operations have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last few years. Our employee headcount and number of customers have increased significantly, and we expect to continue to grow our headcount significantly in future periods. For example, from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2016, our employee headcount increased from 901 to 1,113 employees, and our number of customers increased from approximately 4,600 to over 5,200. We anticipate that we will continue to significantly expand our operations and headcount in the near term, and that our customer base will continue to expand. The growth and expansion of our business and our product and service offerings place a significant strain on our management, operations, sales and marketing, and financial resources. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, our sales and marketing teams and our ability to manage headcount, capital and business processes in an efficient manner.\nWe may not be able to implement improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner, and we may discover deficiencies in our existing systems and processes. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes, which could disrupt existing customer relationships, cause us to lose customers, limit sales of our products, or increase our technical support costs. Our failure to improve our systems and processes, or the failure of those systems and processes to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and accurately forecast our revenue and expenses. Our productivity and the quality of our solutions may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train new employees quickly and effectively. Any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, negatively impact our customers' satisfaction with our solutions and harm our operating results.\nDecreases in retention rates for customer SaaS subscriptions could materially impact our future revenue or operating results.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their SaaS subscriptions or maintenance support arrangements after the expiration of the subscription or maintenance period, which is typically 12 to 24 months. Customers may elect not to renew, or may renew for fewer seat licenses or shorter contract terms for a number of reasons, including a change in corporate priorities or personnel. In addition, we offer a pay-as-you-go model, whereby customers can pay for our SaaS services on a monthly basis without a long-term commitment, which may unexpectedly increase the rate of customer non-renewals and thus negatively and unpredictably affect our recurring revenue. If our customer renewal rates decline, which may occur as a result of many factors, including reduced budgets, insourcing decisions or dissatisfaction with our service, our revenue will be adversely affected and our business will suffer.\nMost of our revenue is derived from our Lead to Money solutions, and a decline in sales of those solutions could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from our Lead to Money solutions. If demand for those solutions declines significantly and we are unable to replace the revenue with revenue from our other offerings, our business and operating results will be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that our current levels of market penetration and revenue from these solutions will continue. If conditions in the market for these solutions change as a result of increased competition or new product offerings by our competitors or consolidation among our competitors, or if we are unable to timely introduce successful new solutions to keep pace with technological advancements, our revenue may decline and our financial results and financial condition would be harmed.\nIf we do not compete effectively, our revenue may not grow and could decline.\nWe experience intense competition from other software companies, as well as from customers' internal development teams. We believe one of our key challenges is to demonstrate the benefits of our solutions to prospective customers so that they will prioritize purchases of our solutions over other options. Our financial performance depends in large part on continued growth in the number of organizations adopting our sales effectiveness solutions to manage the performance of their sales organizations, yet the market for sales effectiveness solutions may not develop as we expect, or at all.\nWe compete principally with vendors of sales effectiveness software, incentive compensation management software, enterprise resource planning software and customer relationship management software. Our competitors may be more successful than we are in capturing the market by, for example, announcing new products, services or enhancements that better meet the needs of prospective customers or our current customers or changing industry standards. In addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Increased competition may cause price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our competitors, particularly our enterprise resource planning competitors, have longer operating histories with significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources. Many also have a larger installed base of users, larger marketing budgets, broader relationships, established distribution agreements, and greater name recognition. Some of our competitors' products may also be more effective at performing particular sales effectiveness or incentive compensation management system functions or may be more customized for particular customer needs in any given market. Even if our competitors provide products with less sales performance management or incentive compensation management system functionality than our solutions, their products may incorporate other capabilities, such as recording and accounting for transactions, customer orders or inventory management. A product that performs these functions, along with the functions of our solutions, may appeal to some customers by reducing the number of software applications they use in their business. Our competitors, especially larger competitors, may also bundle incentive compensation management or other functionalities with their other offerings, rendering our software less competitive from a pricing perspective.\nOur products generally must be integrated with software provided by existing or potential competitors. These competitors could alter their software products in ways that inhibit integration with ours, or they could deny or delay our access to advance software releases, which would restrict or delay our ability to adapt our products for integration with their new releases and could result in the loss of both sales opportunities and renewals of on-demand services and maintenance.\nSome potential customers have already made substantial investments in third-party or internally-developed solutions designed to model, administer, analyze and report on sales effectiveness programs. These companies may be reluctant to abandon such investments in favor of our solutions. In addition, information technology departments of some potential customers may resist purchasing our solutions for a variety of reasons, including concerns that hosted solutions are not sufficiently customizable for their needs or that they pose data security concerns for their enterprises.\nIf we change prices, alter our payment terms or modify our products or services in order to compete, our margins and operating results may be adversely affected.\nThe intensely competitive market in which we do business may require us to change our prices or modify our pricing strategies for our solutions in ways that adversely affect our operating results. If our competitors offer discounts on competitive products or services, we may need to lower prices or offer other terms more favorable to existing and prospective customers in order to compete successfully. If we raise prices based upon our own evaluation of the value of our products, those increases might not be well received by customers, which may hurt our sales. Some of our competitors may bundle their products with other solutions for promotional purposes or as a pricing strategy, or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, limit the prices that we can charge for our solutions or cause us to modify our existing market strategies accordingly. If we cannot offset price reductions and other terms that are more favorable to our customers with a corresponding increase in sales or decrease in spending, then the reduced revenue resulting from lower prices would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results.\nIf we experience service interruptions in our offerings to customers, our business and financial results could be harmed.\nOur business is primarily conducted over the Internet, so we depend on our ability to protect our computer equipment and stored data against damage from natural disasters, human error, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks or other unauthorized intrusion and other events. Moreover, our headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. Although we have redundant facilities to support our operations, our systems, procedures and controls might not be adequate for all eventualities, which could prolong the adverse impact.\nThere can be no assurance that our disaster preparedness will prevent significant interruption of our operations, which could be lengthy, or reduce the speed or functionality of our services. Service interruptions, no matter how prolonged or frequent, may result in material liability claims from customers for breach of service-level commitments, customer terminations and damage to our reputation and business prospects.\nIn addition, third-party service providers for hosting facilities or other critical infrastructure could be interrupted in the event of a natural disaster, facility closings or other unanticipated problems. Third-party telecommunications providers of Internet and other telecommunication services may fail to perform adequately, or their systems may fail to operate properly or be disabled, causing business interruption, system damage or significant expense for us to replace, and could harm our revenue, increase costs, cause regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation.\nPotential changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") could affect our reported financial results and require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. The FASB is currently working with the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") to converge accounting principles, and facilitate more comparable financial reporting, between companies that are required to follow GAAP and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards. In connection with that initiative, the FASB has issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition and accounting for leases, which we discuss in Note 1, The Company and Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading \u201cEffect of New Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d These and other such standards could cause us to adopt new accounting principles, which could significantly impact our reported financial results or cause volatility of those financial results. In addition, we may need to change our customer and vendor contracts, financial accounting systems and other internal processes. The cost and effects of these changes could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\nSoftware errors could be costly and time-consuming for us to correct, and could harm our reputation and impair our ability to sell our solutions.\nOur solutions are based on complex software that may contain errors, or \"bugs,\" that could be costly to correct, harm our reputation and impair our ability to sell our solutions to new customers. Moreover, customers relying on our solutions to implement their incentive compensation arrangements may be more sensitive to such errors, and the attendant potential security vulnerabilities and business interruptions for these applications. If we incur substantial costs to correct any errors of this nature, our operating margins could be adversely affected. Because our customers depend on our solutions for critical business functions, any service interruptions could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and lost sales, higher service-level credits and warranty costs, diversion of development resources and product liability suits.\nSecurity breaches or loss of customer data could create the perception that our solutions are not secure, causing customers to discontinue or reject the use of our solutions and potentially subjecting us to significant liability. Implementing, monitoring and maintaining adequate security safeguards may be costly.\nOur solutions allow our customers to access and transmit confidential data, including personally identifiable information of their employees, agents and customers over the Internet, and we store our customers' data on servers. We may also have access to confidential data in connection with the activities of our professional services organization, including implementation, maintenance and support activities for our customers.\nMoreover, many of our customers are subject to heightened security obligations regarding the personally identifiable information of their downstream customers. In the United States, these heightened obligations particularly affect the financial services, healthcare and insurance sectors, which are subject to controls over personal information under various state and federal laws and regulations. Other directives, such as the European Union Directive on Data Protection and accompanying laws and regulations of the Member States of the European Union implementing the directive, create international obligations on the protection of personal data that typically exceed security requirements mandated in the United States. Implementation of security measures to satisfy customer and regulatory requirements may be substantial and costly.\nOur security measures to protect customer information may be inadequate or breached by third-party action, including intentional misconduct or malfeasance, system error, employee error or otherwise, resulting in unauthorized access to or disclosure of our customers' data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate them or to implement adequate preventative measures. Because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers that our customers may authorize to access their data, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of their activities. In addition, malicious third parties may conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services.\nIf we do not adequately safeguard the information that customers import into our solutions or otherwise provide to us, or if third parties penetrate our solutions and misappropriate customers' confidential information, our reputation may be damaged, resulting in a loss of confidence in our solutions, negatively impacting our brand and future sales, and we may be sued and incur substantial damages. Even if it is determined that our security measures were adequate, the damage to our reputation may cause customers and potential customers to reconsider the use of our solutions, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business depends in part on a strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand could harm our business.\nWe have developed a strong and trusted brand that is associated with our solutions and services and that brand has contributed to the success of our business. Our brand is based on customer trust in our solutions and the implementations of our solutions in their businesses, across a broad range of industries. To continue to expand our customer base, it is important that we maintain, protect and enhance our brand. Our ability to achieve that goal depends largely on our ability to maintain our customers\u2019 trust and continue to provide high-quality and secure solutions. Negative publicity could harm our reputation and customer confidence in and use of our solutions, whether that negative publicity relates to our industry or our company, the quality and reliability of our solutions, our risk management processes, our privacy and security practices, or other issues experienced by our customers. Accordingly, harm to our brand can stem from many sources, such as if we fail to satisfy expectations of service and quality, inadequately protect sensitive information or experience compliance failures. If we do not successfully maintain a strong and trusted brand, our business and financial results may be harmed.\nLegal and regulatory changes related to data protection and privacy could create unexpected costs, require changes to our business, impact the use and adoption of our solutions or require us to agree to onerous terms and conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our future revenue, operating results or customer retention.\nLegal and regulatory frameworks for data protection and privacy issues are evolving worldwide, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. We expect federal, state and foreign governments to expand data protection and privacy regulation and we expect more public scrutiny, enforcement and sanctions in this area. In addition, foreign court judgments and regulatory actions may affect our ability to transfer, process and receive data transnationally, including data that is critical to our operations or core to the functionality of our solutions. New laws, regulations, judgments or actions may relate to the solicitation, collection, processing, use and disclosure of personal information, including cross-border transfers of personal information, in a way that could affect demand for our solutions or cause us to change our platform or business model and increase our costs of doing business.\nOur customers can use our solutions to store compensation and other personal identifying information about their sales personnel that is or may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions and, therefore, may be subject to this evolving legislation, regulation or heightened public scrutiny. In addition to the potential adoption of new laws and regulations in the United States and internationally, evolving definitions and norms regarding personal data may require us to adapt our business practices, or limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business.\nIn order to comply with new United States or international laws, regulations or judgments, including adopting new and potentially onerous customer contractual clauses, we may incur substantial costs or change our business practices in a manner that could reduce our revenue or compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy. Furthermore, to comply with any new non-U.S. laws, regulations or judgments, we may have to create expensive duplicative information technology infrastructure and business operations, which could hinder our expansion plans or render them commercially infeasible, increase our costs of doing business and harm our financial results.\nIn addition, customers may experience higher compliance costs as a result of laws, regulations and judgments, which may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and reduce overall demand, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance. As a result, some industries may not adopt our solutions based on perceived privacy concerns, regardless of the validity of such concerns.\nWhile we take measures to protect the security of information that we collect, use and disclose in the operation of our business, and we offer privacy protections for this information, these measures may not always be effective. Furthermore, although we strive to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and data collection, use and disclosure, these laws and regulations are continually evolving, not always clear and not always consistent across the jurisdictions in which we do business. Any proceedings brought against us relating to compliance with these laws and regulations could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our solutions and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business. There is no assurance that contractual indemnity or insurance would be available to offset any portion of these costs.\nIn addition, if we are perceived as not operating in accordance with industry best privacy practices, we may be subject to negative publicity, government investigation, litigation or investigation by accountability groups. Any action against us could be costly and time consuming, require us to change our business practices, expose us to substantial monetary liability and result in damage to our reputation and business.\nAcquisitions of, and investments in, other businesses present many risks. We may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic benefits of these transactions, and we may not be able to manage our operations with the acquired businesses efficiently or profitably.\nAs part of our business strategy, we evaluate opportunities to expand and enhance our product and service offerings to meet customer needs, increase our market opportunities and grow revenue through internal development efforts and external acquisitions and partnerships. We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including the acquisitions of DataHug Ltd., and of certain assets of Badgeville, Inc. and ViewCentral, LLC in 2016, the acquisition of BridgeFront LLC in 2015 and the acquisitions of LeadRocket, Inc. and Clicktools Ltd. in 2014. We may continue to acquire or make investments in other companies, products, services and technologies in the future. Acquisitions and investments may cause disruptions in, or add complexity to, our operations and involve a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nanticipated benefits, such as increased revenue, may not materialize if, for example, a larger than expected number of customers choose not to renew their contracts or if we are unable to cross-sell the acquired company's solutions to our existing customer base;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty integrating and managing the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines, and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across locations;\n\u2022\nwe may experience challenges in, and have difficulty penetrating, new markets where we have little or no prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nintegrating the financial systems and personnel of the acquired business and retaining key employees may be difficult, and, to the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock to such individuals, existing stockholders may be diluted;\n\u2022\nour ongoing business and management's attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration, or by the complexity of overseeing geographically and culturally diverse locations;\n\u2022\nwe may find that the acquired businesses or assets do not further our business strategy, or that we overpaid for the businesses or assets, or that we do not realize the expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits;\n\u2022\nour use of cash consideration for one or more significant acquisitions may require us to use a substantial portion of our available cash or incur substantial debt, and if we incur substantial debt, it could result in material limitations on the conduct of our business;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to uncover or realize the significance of, or otherwise become exposed to, liabilities and other issues assumed from an acquired business, such as claims from terminated employees or third-parties and unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting practices; and\n\u2022\nwe may experience customer confusion as a result of product overlap, particularly when we offer, price and support various product lines differently.\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or cash flows. Furthermore, during periods of operational expansion, we often need to increase the size of our staff, our related operations and third party partnerships, and potentially amplify our financial and accounting controls to ensure they remain effective. Such changes may increase our expenses, and there is no assurance that our infrastructure will be sufficiently scalable to efficiently manage any growth that we may experience. If we are unable to leverage our operating cost investments as a percentage of revenue, our ability to generate or increase profits will be adversely impacted. In addition, from time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions and other investments that are not ultimately consummated, which could result in significant expense and diversion of management attention.\nSome of our products rely on third-party software licenses to operate, and the loss of or inability to maintain these licenses, or errors, discontinuations or updates to that third-party software, could result in higher costs, delayed sales, customer claims or termination of existing agreements.\nWe license technology and content from several software providers for our reporting, analytics, training, and integration applications, and we anticipate continuing to license technologies and content from these or other providers in connection with our current and future products. We also rely on generally available third-party software to run our applications. Any of these software applications may cease to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or new versions may be released that are incompatible with our offerings. Some of the products could be difficult to replace, and developing or integrating new software with our products could require months or years of design and engineering work. Modification or loss of access to any of these technologies could result in delays in providing our products until equivalent technology or content is developed or, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated. Acquisitions of third-party technologies or content by other companies, including our competitors, may have a material adverse impact on us if the acquirer seeks to cancel or change the terms of our license.\nIn addition, we depend upon the successful operation of third-party products in conjunction with our products or services. As a result, undetected errors in those third-party products could prevent the implementation, or impair the functionality of, our products, delay new product introductions, limit the availability of our products via our on-demand service and injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party products could result in new or higher royalty payments by us if we are required to enter into license agreements for such products.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nWe depend on strategic relationships with third parties, such as resellers, OEM partners, and technology or content providers, to extend the utility or reach of our products and increase our sales. Identifying potential strategic partners, then negotiating, documenting and implementing any resulting strategic relationships, requires us to commit significant time and resources with no guarantee that any resulting revenue will justify the investments. If we fail to establish or maintain effective relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace successfully or to grow our revenues could be impaired, and our operating results could suffer. For example, if our solutions are not integrated with related solutions that are valued by potential customers, it may be more difficult for us to compete and we may lose customers and revenue. Even if we succeed in establishing and maintaining strategic relationships, we cannot assure you that they will result in increased sales of our solutions. In addition, the rate at which any strategic relationship will achieve its intended results, if at all, is outside of our control and difficult to predict.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop new solutions and enhance our existing solutions rapidly and cost-effectively. Failure to introduce new or enhanced solutions that meet customer needs may adversely affect our operating results.\nThe markets for sales effectiveness solutions and cloud computing are generally characterized by:\n\u2022\nrapid technological advances,\n\u2022\nchanging customer needs, and\n\u2022\nfrequent new product introductions and enhancements.\nTo keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements, achieve market acceptance and effectively respond to competition, we must quickly identify emerging trends and requirements, accurately define and design enhancements and improvements for existing solutions, and introduce new solutions that satisfy our customers' changing demands. Accelerated introductions for new solutions require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results. Further, any new solutions we develop may not be introduced in a timely manner or be available in a distribution model favored by our target markets and, therefore, may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If we are unable to quickly and successfully develop or acquire and distribute new products and services cost-effectively, or enhance existing solutions, or if we fail to position and price our solutions to meet market demand, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur offshore product development, support and professional services may prove difficult to manage and may not allow us to realize our growth and cost reduction goals, or produce effective new solutions.\nWe use offshore resources to perform new product development and provide support and professional services, which requires detailed technical and logistical coordination. We must ensure that our offshore resources are aware of and understand development specifications and customer support, as well as implementation and configuration requirements, and that they can meet applicable timelines. If we are unable to maintain acceptable standards of quality in product development, support and professional services through our offshore resources, including our personnel and our third-party service providers, our attempts to reduce costs and drive growth through new products and through margin improvements in technical support and professional services may be negatively impacted, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The use of offshore resources, including third-party service providers, may expose us to misappropriation of our intellectual property or that of our customers, or make it more difficult to defend intellectual property rights in our technology.\nThe vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union could adversely affect us.\nThe United Kingdom vote authorizing its exit from the European Union (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) could over time create uncertainty and disrupt our business. For example, our relationships with European customers or prospective customers in the United Kingdom, data centers and other vendors, and employees could change in unpredictable ways and have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations, and could also have an adverse impact on our bookings. The outcome of negotiations about the specific terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union are unpredictable. For example, important issues such as trade and tariff, immigration, intellectual property and commercial regulation may be modified during a transition period or permanently. These measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions, and may cause us to lose customers or prospective customers, vendors, and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and divergent national laws and regulations where previously European Union laws and regulations prevailed, raising our cost of doing business. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe loss of key personnel, higher than normal employee attrition in key departments or the inability of replacement personnel to quickly and successfully perform in their new roles could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the abilities and effectiveness of our personnel, and, in particular, our chief executive officer and other executive officers. All of our existing personnel, including our executive officers, are employed on an \"at-will\" basis. If we lose or terminate the services of one or more of our current executives or key employees or if one or more of our current or former executives or key employees joins a competitor or otherwise competes with us, or if we do not have an effective succession or development plan in place for such individuals, our ability to successfully implement our business plan could be impaired. Likewise, if a number of employees from specific departments were to depart, our business may be adversely affected. If we are unable to quickly identify, hire, develop and retain qualified replacements for our executives, other key positions or employees within specific departments, our ability to execute our business plan and continue to maintain and grow our business could be harmed. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters are located, so we may need to invest heavily to attract and retain new personnel, and we may never realize returns on those investments. Even if we can quickly hire qualified replacements, we would expect to experience operational disruptions and inefficiencies during any transition.\nIf we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees and contractors, including sales, professional services and engineering personnel, our growth may be impaired.\nTo scale our business successfully, increase productivity, maintain a high level of quality and meet customers' needs, we need to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled employees and contractors in all areas of our business, including sales, professional services and engineering. In particular, if we are unable to hire and retain talented personnel with the skills, and in the locations, we require, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on contractors. Furthermore, we have increased and intend to continue to increase our sales force and, if we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, or if new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels within a reasonable time period, we may not be able to increase our revenue and realize the anticipated benefits of these investments.\nAs our customer base increases and as we continue to evaluate and modify our organizational structure to increase efficiency, we are likely to experience staffing constraints in connection with the deployment of trained and experienced professional services and support resources capable of implementing, configuring, maintaining and supporting our products and related services. Moreover, as a company focused on the development of complex products and the provision of online services, we are often in need of additional software developers and engineers. We have relied on our ability to grant equity compensation as one mechanism for recruiting, retaining and motivating such highly skilled personnel. Our ability to provide equity compensation depends, in part, upon receiving stockholder approval for an increase in shares authorized for issuance pursuant to our equity compensation plan. If we are not able to secure such approval from our stockholders, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our personnel may be adversely impacted, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Effective planning and management processes are necessary to meet these requirements. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future. We are also required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by The Nasdaq Stock Market, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities, which could be costly for us.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property, we may lose valuable assets, experience reduced revenue and incur costly litigation.\nOur success and ability to compete depends on our internally-developed technology and expertise, including the proprietary technology embedded in our solutions, as well as our ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, contractual provisions and other similar measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We cannot protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect its unauthorized use. Despite our precautions, unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or reverse engineer our solutions and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Provisions in our agreements prohibiting unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our licensed programs and services may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and the outcome of any actions taken in any foreign jurisdiction to enforce our rights may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. To the extent that we engage in international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products, services and proprietary information increases.\nWe enter into various restrictive agreements with our employees and consultants, as well as with customers and third parties with whom we have strategic relationships. We cannot ensure that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products, services and proprietary information. These agreements also do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our solutions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our trade secrets. Litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could seriously harm our business.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if we are subject to a protracted infringement claim or one that results in a significant damage award.\nFrom time to time, we receive claims that our products, services offerings or business infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we have in the past, and may continue in the future, to assert claims of infringement against third parties on such bases. Our competitors or other third parties may also challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights. We believe that claims of infringement are likely to increase as the functionalities of our solutions expand and we introduce new solutions, including technology acquired or licensed from third parties. Any infringement claim, whether offensive or defensive, could:\n\u2022\nrequire costly litigation to resolve;\n\u2022\nabsorb significant management time;\n\u2022\ncause us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements;\n\u2022\nrequire us to discontinue the sale of, or materially modify, all or a portion of our products or services;\n\u2022\nrequire us to indemnify our customers or third-party service providers; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to expend additional development resources to redesign our products or services.\nInclusion of open source software in our products may expose us to liability or require release of our source code.\nWe currently use open source software in our products and may use more in the future. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software that has been incorporated into our products. In addition, some open source software is provided under licenses which require that proprietary software, when combined in specific ways with open source software, become subject to the open source license and thus freely available. While we take steps to minimize the risk that our products, when incorporated with open source software, would become subject to such provisions, few courts have interpreted open source licenses. As a result, the enforcement of these licenses is unclear. If our products became subject to open source licenses, our ability to continue commercializing our solutions, along with our operating results, would be materially and adversely affected.\nSales to customers in international markets pose risks and challenges for which we may not achieve the expected results.\nWe continue to invest substantial time and resources to grow our international operations. If we fail to do so successfully, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. Such expansion may require substantial financial resources and management attention. International operations involve a variety of risks, particularly:\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in supporting and localizing our solutions;\n\u2022\ncomplying with numerous regulatory requirements, taxes, trade and export laws and tariffs that may conflict or change unexpectedly, including labor, tax, privacy and data protection;\n\u2022\nusing international resellers and complying with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in maintaining acceptable quality standards in support, product development and professional services by our international third-party service providers;\n\u2022\ndiffering abilities to protect our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\npossible political and economic instability.\nWe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nWe are potentially exposed to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our revenue and expenses occur in U.S. Dollars, some occur in local currencies and the amounts occurring in local currencies may increase as we expand our international operations. An increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S., and a weakened U.S. Dollar could increase the cost of our expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. Therefore, fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies may have a negative impact on our revenue and operating activities.\nOur services revenue produces substantially lower gross margins than our recurring revenue, and periodic variations in the proportional relationship between services revenue and higher margin recurring revenue may harm our overall gross margins.\nOur services revenue, which includes fees for consulting, implementation and training, represented 24% of our revenue in 2015 and 21% of our revenue in 2016. Our services revenue has a substantially lower gross margin than our recurring revenue.\nThe percentage of total revenue represented by services revenue has varied significantly from period to period principally because the number of new recurring revenue customer transactions varies from quarter to quarter.\nDeployment of solutions may require substantial technical implementation and support by us or third-party service providers. We may lose sales opportunities and our business may be harmed if we do not meet these implementation and support requirements, which may cause a decline in revenue and an increase in our expenses.\nWe deploy solutions, such as large enterprise-wide deployments, that require a substantial degree of technical and logistical expertise, personnel commitments, and mutual cooperation to achieve milestone and other commitments by both us and our customers. It may be difficult for us to manage these deployments, including the timely allocation of personnel and resources by us and our customers. Failure to successfully manage the process could harm our reputation, both generally and with specific customers, harming our sales and causing customer disputes, which could adversely affect our revenue and increase our technical support and litigation costs. If actual remediation services exceed our accrued estimates, we could be required to take additional charges, which could be material.\nWe engage third-party partners, systems integrators and software vendors to provide customer referrals, cooperate with us in the design, sales and marketing of our solutions, provide insights into market demands, and provide our customers with systems implementation services or overall program management. In some cases, we may not have formal\nagreements governing such relationships, and the agreements we do have generally do not include specific obligations with respect to exclusivity, generating sales opportunities or cooperating on future business.\nFrom time to time, we also consider new or unusual strategic relationships, which can pose additional risks. For example, while reseller arrangements offer the advantage of leveraging larger sales organizations than our own to sell our products, they also require considerable time and effort on our part to train and support the reseller's personnel, and require the reseller to properly motivate and incentivize its sales force. Also, if we enter into an exclusive reseller arrangement, the exclusivity may prevent us from pursuing the applicable market ourselves, and if the reseller is not successful in the particular location, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nShould any of these third-parties go out of business, perform unsatisfactory services or choose not to work with us, we may be forced to develop new capabilities internally, which may cause significant delays and expense, thereby adversely affecting our operating results. These third-party providers may offer products of other companies, including products competitive with ours. If we do not successfully or efficiently establish, maintain and expand our relationships with influential market participants, we could lose sales and service opportunities, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur solutions have unpredictable sales cycles, making it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results.\nIt is difficult to determine how long the sales cycles for our solutions will be, thereby making it difficult to predict the quarter in which a particular sale will close and to plan expenditures accordingly. Moreover, to the extent that sales are completed in the final two weeks of a quarter, the impact of recurring revenue transactions is typically not reflected in our financial statements until subsequent quarters. The period between our initial contact with a potential customer and ultimate sale of our solutions is relatively long due to several factors, which may include:\n\u2022\nthe complex nature of some of our products;\n\u2022\nthe need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our solutions;\n\u2022\nbudget cycles of our potential customers that affect the timing of purchases;\n\u2022\nthe expiration date of existing point solutions that we seek to replace;\n\u2022\ncustomer requirements for competitive evaluation and often lengthy internal approval processes and protracted contract negotiations (particularly of large organizations) before purchasing our solutions; and\n\u2022\npotential delays of purchases due to announcements or planned introductions of new solutions by us or our competitors.\nThe length and unpredictability of our sales cycle make it difficult for us to project revenues and plan for levels of expenditures to support our solutions appropriately. If we do not manage our sales cycle successfully, we may misallocate resources and our financial results may be harmed.\nOur credit agreement contains restrictive covenants and financial covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. Furthermore, if we default on our obligations under the credit agreement, our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn May 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\"Wells Fargo\"), under which Wells Fargo agreed to provide a revolving loan (\"Revolver\") to us in an amount not to exceed $10.0 million, which was increased to $15.0 million in September 2014. We may draw upon the Revolver to finance our operations or for other corporate purposes. The Revolver contains a number of restrictive covenants, and its terms may restrict our current and future operations, including:\n\u2022\nour flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour ability to use our cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with the covenants or payment obligations specified in the Revolver, we may trigger an event of default and Wells Fargo would have the right to: (i) terminate its commitment to provide additional loans under the Revolver, and (ii) declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, Wells Fargo would have the right to proceed against the Revolver collateral, which consists of substantially all of our assets. If the debt under the Revolver were to be accelerated we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay this debt, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the terms of our current or future indebtedness or assessments of our creditworthiness may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot provide assurances that additional borrowing capacity will be available under the Revolver, including whether future indebtedness will be obtainable on favorable terms. As a result, in the future, we may be subject to higher interest rates and our interest expense may increase, which may have an adverse effect on our financial results. Furthermore, any future assessments by any rating agency of our creditworthiness could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results.\nOur latest product features and functionality may require existing on-premise license customers to migrate to our SaaS solutions. Moreover, we may choose or be compelled to discontinue maintenance support for older versions of our software products, forcing our on-premise customers to upgrade their software in order to continue receiving maintenance support. If existing on-premise license customers fail to migrate or delay migration to our on-demand solution, our revenue may be harmed.\nWe continue to promote our on-demand product offerings to existing customers who currently have on-premise perpetual and term licenses. Customers with on-premise licenses may need to migrate to our on-demand solutions to take full advantage of the features and functionality in those solutions. For example, in April 2016, we stopped offering perpetual licenses for our commissions product. We expect to periodically terminate maintenance support on older versions of our on-premise products for various reasons including, without limitation, termination of support by third-party software vendors whose products complement ours or upon which we are dependent. Regardless of the reason, a migration is likely to involve additional cost, which our customers may delay or decline to incur. If a sufficient number of customers do not migrate to our on-demand product offerings, our continued maintenance support opportunities and our ability to sell additional products to these customers, and as a result, our revenue and operating income, may be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nOur stock price is likely to remain volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has in the past, and may in the future, be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including those described in this section. The volume of trading in our common stock is limited, which may increase volatility. Investors should consider an investment in our common stock as risky and should purchase our common stock only if they can withstand significant losses. Other factors that affect the volatility of our stock include:\n\u2022\nour actual and anticipated operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nactual and anticipated fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us;\n\u2022\nratings changes by any securities analysts who follow us;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet our projected results or the published operating estimates or expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve revenue or earnings expectations;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the global economy;\n\u2022\nsignificant sales by existing investors, coupled with limited trading volume for our stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, results of operations, projections, or new technologies;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity;\n\u2022\nacquisitions, commercial relationships, joint-ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in our management team or board of directors;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports, particularly those that are inaccurate or unfavorable, about us or our industry by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents or terrorism or responses to these events.\nAdditionally, some companies with volatile market prices for their securities have been the subject of securities class action lawsuits. Any such suit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of our common stock. Such issuances will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock. In addition, sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public trading market (or in private transactions), including sales by our executive officers, directors or institutional investors, or the perception that such additional sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to drop. We have stock options and restricted stock units outstanding for shares of our common stock. Our stockholders may incur dilution upon exercise of an outstanding stock option or vesting of outstanding restricted stock units.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third-party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. For example, if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us, the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting. In addition, our board of directors has staggered terms, which means that replacing a majority of our directors would require at least two annual meetings. A potential acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to replace directors at any annual meeting, and would not be able to accumulate votes at a meeting, which would require such potential acquirer to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted. Furthermore, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law limits business combination transactions with 15% stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors. All of these factors make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. Our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with a\npotential acquirer that it does not believe is in our strategic interests. If a potential acquirer is discouraged from offering to acquire us or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by these or other measures, under some circumstances, the market price of our common stock could be reduced.", "PERMNO": 89905, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "CALD"}
