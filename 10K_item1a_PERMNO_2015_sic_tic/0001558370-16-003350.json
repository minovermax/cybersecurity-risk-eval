RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties - many of which are beyond our control - that may cause our actual operating results or financial performance to be materially different from our expectations. If one or more of the events discussed in this report were to occur, actual outcomes could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements we make in this report or our other filings with the SEC, and our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected; furthermore, the trading price of our common stock could decline and our shareholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the ultimate net effect that the Affordable Care Act may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Affordable Care Act has changed how healthcare services in the United States are covered, delivered and financed. The expansion of health insurance coverage under the law has resulted in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage and a material decrease in uninsured and charity care admissions. However, it remains difficult to predict the full impact of the ACA on our future revenues and operations at this time due to uncertainty regarding a number of material factors, including:\n\u00b7\nhow many states will ultimately implement the Medicaid expansion provisions and under what terms (a number of states in which we operate, including Florida and Texas, have chosen not to expand their Medicaid programs at this time);\n\u00b7\nhow many currently uninsured individuals will ultimately obtain and retain insurance coverage (either private health insurance or Medicaid) as a result of the ACA;\n\u00b7\nwhat percentage of our newly insured patients will be covered under the Medicaid program and what percentage will be covered by private health insurers;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which states will enroll new Medicaid participants in managed care programs;\n\u00b7\nthe pace at which insurance coverage expands, including the pace of different types of coverage expansion;\n\u00b7\nfuture changes in the rates paid to hospitals by private payers for newly covered individuals, including those covered through health insurance exchanges and those who might be covered under the Medicaid program under contracts with a state;\n\u00b7\nfuture changes in the rates paid by state governments under the Medicaid program for newly covered individuals;\n\u00b7\nthe percentage of individuals in the exchanges who select the high-deductible plans, considering that health insurers offering those kinds of products have traditionally sought to pay lower rates to hospitals;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which the enhanced program integrity and fraud and abuse provisions lead to a greater number of civil or criminal actions or impact Medicare and Medicaid payments to us; and\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which the provisions of the Affordable Care Act will put pressure on the profitability of health insurers, which in turn might cause them to seek to reduce payments to hospitals with respect to both newly insured individuals and their existing business.\nFurthermore, the Affordable Care Act provides for significant reductions in the growth of Medicare spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality and clinical integration. A substantial portion of both our patient volumes and, as result, our revenues is derived from government healthcare programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Any reductions to our reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs could adversely affect our business and results of operations to the extent such reductions are not offset by increased revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals. It is difficult to predict the future effect on our revenues resulting from reductions to Medicare and Medicaid spending because of uncertainty regarding a number of material factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe amount of overall revenues we will generate from the Medicare and Medicaid programs when the reductions are fully implemented;\n\u00b7\nwhether future reductions required by the ACA will be changed by statute prior to becoming effective;\n\u00b7\nthe size of the annual productivity adjustment to the market basket;\n\u00b7\nthe reductions to Medicaid DSH payments commencing in FFY 2018;\n\u00b7\nwhat the losses in revenues, if any, will be from the ACA\u2019s quality initiatives;\n\u00b7\nhow successful accountable care networks and other pilot programs in which we participate will be at coordinating care and reducing costs or whether they will decrease reimbursement; and\n\u00b7\nthe scope and nature of potential changes to Medicare reimbursement methods, such as an emphasis on bundling payments or coordination of care programs.\nIn addition, we may continue to experience a high level of bad debt expense and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for undocumented immigrants who are not permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government healthcare insurance program.\nIn general, there is still uncertainty with respect to the positive and negative effects the Affordable Care Act may have on reimbursement, utilization and the future design of provider networks and insurance plans (including pricing, provider participation, coverage, co-pays and deductibles), and the multiple models that attempt to forecast those effects may differ materially from our expectations. We are unable to predict the net effect of the ACA on our future revenues and operations at this time due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate number of uninsured individuals who will obtain and retain insurance coverage, uncertainty regarding future negotiations with payers, uncertainty regarding Medicaid expansion, and gradual and, in some cases, delayed implementation of certain provisions of the law. We also cannot predict the outcome of continuing legal challenges to certain provisions of the ACA or what action, if any, Congress might take with respect to the ACA. Any action that negatively impacts the number of individuals who have health insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to enter into and maintain managed care contractual arrangements on acceptable terms, if we experience material reductions in the contracted rates we receive from managed care payers or if we have difficulty collecting from managed care payers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various HMOs and PPOs. The amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.6 billion, which represented approximately 60% of our total net patient revenues before provision for doubtful accounts. Approximately 62% of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 was derived from our top ten managed care payers. In the year ended December 31, 2015, our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately 76% higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers, including managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans. In addition, at December 31, 2015, approximately 59% of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers.\nOur ability to negotiate favorable contracts with HMOs, insurers offering preferred provider arrangements and other managed care plans significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. In addition, private payers are increasingly attempting to control healthcare costs through direct contracting with hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis, increased utilization reviews and greater enrollment in managed care programs, such as HMOs and PPOs. The trend toward consolidation among private managed care payers tends to increase their bargaining power over prices and fee structures. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to renew existing managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on competitive terms. Other healthcare companies, including some with greater financial resources, greater geographic coverage or a wider range of services, may compete with us for these opportunities. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Any material reductions in the contracted rates we receive for our services or any significant difficulties in collecting receivables from managed care payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Any material adverse effects resulting from future reductions in payments from private payers could be exacerbated if we are not able to manage our operating costs effectively.\nFurther changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or other government healthcare programs could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 20.4% of our net patient revenues before provision for doubtful accounts for our Hospital Operations and other segment were related to the Medicare program, and approximately 8.7% of our net patient revenues before provision for doubtful accounts for our Hospital Operations and other segment were related to various state Medicaid programs, in each case excluding Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs. In addition to the changes affected by the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to: other statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements, funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements, among other things; requirements for utilization review; and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future, as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities, which could in turn adversely affect our overall business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Any material adverse effects resulting from future reductions in payments from government programs could be exacerbated if we are not able to manage our operating costs effectively.\nSeveral states in which we operate face budgetary challenges that have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Because most states must operate with balanced budgets, and the Medicaid program is generally a significant portion of a state\u2019s budget, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting future legislation designed to reduce or not increase their Medicaid expenditures. In addition, some states delay issuing Medicaid payments to providers to manage state expenditures. As an alternative means of funding provider payments, many of the states in which we operate have adopted provider fee programs or have received federal government waivers allowing them to test new approaches and demonstration projects to improve care. Continuing pressure on state budgets and other factors could result in future reductions to Medicaid payments, payment delays or additional taxes on hospitals.\nIn general, we are unable to predict the effect of future government healthcare funding policy changes on our operations. If the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced, if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited, or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries\u2019 hospitals are excluded from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program or any other government healthcare program, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe industry trend toward value-based purchasing and alternative payment models may negatively impact our revenues.\nValue-based purchasing and alternative payment model initiatives of both governmental and private payers tying financial incentives to quality and efficiency of care will increasingly affect the results of operations of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities, and may negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet expected quality standards. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing in federal healthcare programs. Medicare now requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded automatically. In addition, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive increased reimbursement payments, and hospitals that have \u201cexcess readmissions\u201d for specified conditions will receive reduced reimbursement. Furthermore, Medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the treatment of certain hospital-acquired conditions, also known as HACs, unless the conditions were present at admission. Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that rank in the worst 25% of all hospitals nationally for HACs in the previous year receive reduced Medicare reimbursements. The ACA also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for treating certain provider-preventable conditions.\nThe Secretary of HHS also recently announced a goal of tying 30% of traditional Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models or bundled payment arrangements by the end of 2016, and tying 50% of payments to these models by the end of 2018. In furtherance of this goal, in November 2015, CMS finalized a new five-year demonstration project, called the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (\u201cCJR\u201d) model, set to begin on April 1, 2016, which will hold hospitals accountable for the quality of care they deliver to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries for hip and knee replacements (and other major leg procedures) from surgery through recovery. As a result, the hospital in which a lower extremity joint replacement (\u201cLEJR\u201d) procedure takes place will be held financially accountable for quality and costs for the entire episode of care, from the date of surgery through 90 days post-discharge, including services not provided by the hospital, such as physician, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing and home health services. Through the CJR payment model, beginning in 2017, participating hospitals in 67 geographic areas across the country - including 20 of our acute care hospitals and four short-stay surgical facilities operated by our USPI joint venture - will be eligible to receive incentive payments or will be subject to payment reductions within certain corridors based on their performance against quality and spending criteria. We anticipate that CMS will develop additional, similar, alternative payment models for other conditions in the future.\nThere is also a trend among private payers toward value-based purchasing and alternative payment models for healthcare services. Many large commercial payers expect hospitals to report quality data, and several of these payers will not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts.\nWe are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues, particularly if we are unable to meet the quality and cost standards established by both governmental and private payers under new value-based purchasing and alternative payment models.\nOur hospitals, outpatient centers and other healthcare businesses operate in competitive environments, and competition in our markets can adversely affect patient volumes.\nThe healthcare business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals and outpatient centers in the local communities we serve provide services similar to those we offer, and, in some cases, competing facilities (1) are more established or newer than ours, (2) may offer a broader array of services to patients and physicians than ours, and (3) may have larger\nor more specialized medical staffs to admit and refer patients, among other things. Furthermore, healthcare consumers are now able to access hospital performance data on quality measures and patient satisfaction, as well as standard charges for services, to compare competing providers; if any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys, or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, we may attract fewer patients. Additional quality measures and future trends toward clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes.\nIn the future, we expect to encounter increased competition from system-affiliated hospitals and healthcare companies in specific geographic markets. We also face competition from specialty hospitals (some of which are physician-owned) and unaffiliated freestanding outpatient centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. Furthermore, some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by government agencies or not-for-profit organizations supported by endowments and charitable contributions and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. As is the case with our hospitals, some of our health plan competitors are owned by governmental agencies or non-profit corporations that have greater financial resources than we do. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities than we are, we may experience an overall decline in patient volumes.\nOur business and financial results could be harmed if we are alleged to have violated existing regulations or if we fail to comply with new or changed regulations.\nOur hospitals, outpatient centers and related healthcare businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, licensure, contractual arrangements, conduct of operations, privacy of patient information, ownership of facilities, physician relationships, addition of facilities and services, and reimbursement rates for services. The laws, rules and regulations governing the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in certain areas, the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance. Moreover, pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, the OIG is permitted to suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments to a provider of services \u201cpending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.\u201d The potential consequences for violating such laws, rules or regulations include reimbursement of government program payments, the assessment of civil monetary penalties, including treble damages, fines, which could be significant, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, or criminal sanctions against current or former employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or cash flows. Even a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of law could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock and our business reputation could suffer.\nFurthermore, healthcare, as one of the largest industries in the United States, continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local healthcare regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations. Further changes in the regulatory framework negatively affecting healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are also required to comply with various federal and state labor laws, rules and regulations governing a variety of workplace wage and hour issues. From time to time, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and private litigation concerning our application of such laws, rules and regulations.\nWe could be subject to substantial uninsured liabilities or increased insurance costs as a result of significant legal actions.\nWe are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. Some of these actions may involve large demands, as well as substantial defense costs. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages, litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to such caps. Our professional and general liability insurance does not cover all claims against us, and it may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain at adequate levels, as the healthcare industry has seen significant increases in the cost of such insurance due to increased litigation. We cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal actions against us or the effect that judgments or settlements in such matters may have on us or on our insurance costs. Additionally, all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations.\nIf the aggregate limit of any of our professional and general liability policies is exhausted, in whole or in part, it could deplete or reduce the limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period. Any losses not covered by or in excess of the amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from our working capital. Furthermore, one or more of our insurance carriers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill its or their obligations to defend, pay or reimburse us when those obligations become due. In that case or if payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIt is essential to our ongoing business that we attract an appropriate number of quality physicians in the specialties required to support our services and that we maintain good relations with those physicians.\nThe success of our business depends in significant part on the number, quality, specialties, and admitting and scheduling practices of the licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staffs of our hospitals and who affiliate with us and use our facilities as an extension of their practices. Although we operate physician practices and, where permitted by law, employ physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals or surgery centers at which they practice. Furthermore, members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also often serve on the medical staffs of hospitals we do not operate, and they are free to terminate their association with our hospitals or admit their patients to competing hospitals at any time. In addition, although physicians who own interests in our facilities are generally subject to agreements restricting them from owning an interest in competitive facilities, we may not learn of, or be unsuccessful in preventing, our physician partners from acquiring interests in competitive facilities. In some of our markets, physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain specialties and the difficulties that physicians can experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of quality physicians by providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment, and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, physicians may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions and outpatient visits may decrease and our operating performance may decline.\nOur new USPI joint venture and our recent hospital-based joint ventures depend on existing relationships with key health system partners. If we are not able to maintain historical relationships with these health system partners, or enter into new relationships, we may be unable to implement our business strategies successfully.\nOur new USPI joint venture and our recent hospital-based joint ventures depend in part on the efforts, reputations and success of health system partners and the strength of our relationships with those health systems. Our joint ventures could be adversely affected by any damage to those health systems\u2019 reputations or to our relationships with them. In many cases, our joint venture agreements are structured to comply with current IRS revenue rulings, as well as case law, relevant to joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit healthcare entities. Material changes in these authorities could adversely affect our relationships with health system partners. If we are unable to maintain existing arrangements on favorable terms or enter into relationships with additional health system partners, we may be unable to implement our business strategies for our joint ventures successfully.\nOur labor costs could be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity.\nThe operations of our facilities are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, including nurses, therapists, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our employed physicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining employees, and, like others in the healthcare industry, we continue to experience a shortage of critical-care nurses in certain disciplines and geographic areas. As a result, from time to time, we may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain experienced employees, make greater investments in education and training for newly licensed medical support personnel, or hire more expensive temporary or contract employees. Furthermore, state-mandated nurse-staffing ratios in California affect not only our labor costs, but, if we are unable to hire the necessary number of experienced nurses to meet the required ratios, they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues. In general, our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, experienced nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs. At December 31, 2015, approximately 20% of the employees in our Hospital Operations and other segment were represented by labor unions. There were no unionized employees in our Ambulatory Care segment, and less than 1% of Conifer\u2019s employees belong to a union. Unionized employees - primarily registered nurses and service and maintenance workers - are located at 37 of our hospitals, the majority of which are in California, Florida and Michigan. We currently have two expired contracts and are negotiating renewals under extension agreements. We are also negotiating first contracts at two of our hospitals where employees selected union representation. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the negotiations, but increases in salaries, wages and benefits could result from these agreements. Furthermore, there is a possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, which could increase our labor costs and have an adverse effect on our patient admissions and net operating revenues. Future organizing activities by labor unions could increase our level of union representation; to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially.\nConifer\u2019s future success also depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel. Competition for the caliber and number of employees we require at Conifer is intense. We may face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training Conifer\u2019s employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our Conifer employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring, integrating and training their replacements, and the quality of Conifer\u2019s services and its ability to serve its customers could diminish, resulting in a material adverse effect on that segment of our business.\nOur business and financial results could be harmed by a national or localized outbreak of a highly contagious or epidemic disease.\nIf an outbreak of an infectious disease such as the Zika virus or the Ebola virus were to occur nationally or in one of the regions our hospitals serve, our business and financial results could be adversely effected. The treatment of a highly contagious disease at one of our facilities may result in a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients. In addition, unaffected individuals may decide to defer elective procedures or otherwise avoid medical treatment, resulting in reduced patient volumes and operating revenues. Furthermore, we cannot predict the costs associated with the potential treatment of an infectious disease outbreak by our hospitals or preparation for such treatment.\nConifer operates in a highly competitive industry, and its current or future competitors may be able to compete more effectively than Conifer does, which could have a material adverse effect on Conifer\u2019s margins, growth rate and market share.\nWe intend to continue to market and expand Conifer\u2019s revenue cycle management, patient communications and engagement services, and management services businesses. However, the market for Conifer\u2019s solutions is highly competitive, and we expect competition may intensify in the future. Conifer faces competition from existing participants and new entrants to the revenue cycle management market (including software vendors and other technology-supported revenue cycle management outsourcing companies, traditional consultants and information technology outsourcing firms), as well as from the staffs of hospitals and other healthcare providers who handle these processes internally. To be successful, Conifer must respond more quickly and effectively than its competitors to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, regulations and customer requirements. Moreover, existing or new competitors may introduce technologies or services that render Conifer\u2019s technologies or services obsolete or less marketable. Even if Conifer\u2019s technologies and services are more effective than the offerings of its competitors, current or potential customers might prefer competitive technologies or services to Conifer\u2019s technologies and services. Furthermore, increased competition may result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact Conifer\u2019s margins, growth rate or market share.\nThe failure to comply with consumer financial, debt collection and credit reporting laws and regulations could subject Conifer and its subsidiaries to fines and other liabilities, as well as harm Conifer\u2019s business and reputation.\nConifer and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous federal, state and local consumer financial, debt collection and credit reporting laws, rules and regulations. Regulations governing debt collection are subject to changing\ninterpretations that may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. In addition, a regulatory determination made by, or a settlement or consent decree entered into with, one regulatory agency, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, may not be binding upon, or preclude, investigations or regulatory actions by state or local agencies. Conifer\u2019s failure to comply with consumer financial, debt collection and credit reporting requirements could result in, among other things, the issuance of cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), the imposition of fines or refunds, and other civil and criminal penalties, some of which could be significant in the case of knowing or reckless violations. In addition, Conifer\u2019s failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to it could result in reduced demand for its services, invalidate all or portions of some of Conifer\u2019s services agreements with its customers, or give customers the right to terminate Conifer\u2019s services agreements with them, among other things, any of which could have an adverse effect on Conifer\u2019s business. Furthermore, if Conifer or its subsidiaries become subject to fines or other penalties, it could harm Conifer\u2019s reputation, thereby making it more difficult for Conifer to retain existing customers or attract new customers\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, catastrophic events and other disruptions affecting our information technology and related systems.\nAs a provider of healthcare services, information technology is a critical component of the day-to-day operation of our business. We rely on our information technology to process, transmit and store sensitive and confidential data, including protected health information, personally identifiable information of our patients and employees, and our proprietary and confidential business performance data. We utilize electronic health records and other health information technology, along with additional technology systems, in connection with our operations, including for, among other things, billing, supply chain and labor management. Our systems, in turn, interface with and rely on third-party systems. Although we monitor and routinely test our security systems and processes and have a diversified data network that provides redundancies as well as other measures designed to protect the security and availability of the data we process, transmit and store, our information technology and infrastructure have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses, attacks by hackers, or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance. While we are not aware of having experienced a material breach of cybersecurity, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of such incidents and protect our information technology may not be sufficient in the future. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may not be able to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective protective measures, and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and strengthen our security measures, investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities in our information systems and infrastructure, or invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks. Third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions, or with whom our systems interface, are also subject to the risks outlined above and may not have or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information. A breach or attack affecting one of our third-party service providers or partners could harm our business even if we do not control the service that is attacked. Further, successful cyber-attacks at other healthcare services companies, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in our industry that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or of the healthcare industry in general, which could result in reduced use of our services. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.\nFurthermore, our networks and technology systems are subject to disruption due to events such as a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event. Any such breach or system interruption could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse or loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, could negatively impact our ability to conduct normal business operations (including the collection of revenues), and could result in potential liability under privacy, security, consumer protection or other applicable laws, regulatory penalties, negative publicity and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that our corporate development activities will achieve their business goals or the cost and service synergies we expect.\nWe have completed, or have announced plans to complete, a number of acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our business strategy, and we expect to enter into similar transactions in the future. We cannot provide any assurances that these transactions will achieve their business goals or the cost and service synergies we expect. In particular, our USPI joint venture represents an increased strategic focus on ambulatory and short-stay surgical\nfacilities, as well as related imaging services businesses, and we cannot provide any assurances that this strategy will be successful. Furthermore, with respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate transactions on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns, synergies or other benefits in a timely manner or at all. With respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulties in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives. In addition, our divestiture activities have required, and may in the future require, us to recognize impairment charges or to agree to contractual restrictions that limit our ability to reenter the applicable market, which may be material.\nCompanies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve the profitability that justifies the investments made. Furthermore, the nature of a joint venture requires us to consult with and share certain decision-making powers with unaffiliated third parties, some of which may be not-for-profit healthcare systems. If our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business or strategic plans. In that case, our results could be adversely affected or we may be required to increase our level of financial commitment to the joint venture. Moreover, differences in economic or business interests or goals among joint venture participants could result in delayed decisions, failures to agree on major issues and even litigation. If these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business or strategic plans, or if our joint venture partners take actions contrary to our policies, objectives or the best interests of the joint venture, our results could be adversely affected. In addition, our relationships with not-for-profit healthcare systems and the joint venture agreements that govern these relationships are intended to be structured to comply with current revenue rulings published by the IRS, as well as case law relevant to joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit healthcare entities. Material changes in these authorities could adversely affect our relationships with not-for-profit healthcare systems and related joint venture arrangements.\nOur corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses and the integration or separation of personnel and financial and other systems. Future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur existing joint ventures may limit our flexibility with respect to such jointly owned investments and could, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to sell the underlying assets or ownership interests in the joint ventures.\nWe have invested in a number of joint ventures with other entities when circumstances warranted the use of these structures, and we may form additional joint ventures in the future. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:\n\u00b7\nWe could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes.\n\u00b7\nWe may not be able to maintain good relationships with our joint venture partners (including health system partners), which could limit our future growth potential and could have an adverse effect our business strategies.\n\u00b7\nOur joint venture partners could have investment or operational goals that are not consistent with our corporate-wide objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for investments or future growth opportunities.\n\u00b7\nOur joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as joint venture partners, which may require us to infuse our own capital into any such venture on behalf of the related joint venture partner or partners despite other competing uses for such capital.\n\u00b7\nMany of our existing joint ventures require that one of our wholly owned affiliates provide a working capital line of credit to the joint venture, which could require us to allocate substantial financial resources to the joint venture potentially impacting our ability to fund our other short-term obligations.\n\u00b7\nSome of our existing joint ventures require mandatory capital expenditures for the benefit of the applicable joint venture, which could limit our ability to expend funds on other corporate opportunities.\n\u00b7\nOur joint venture partners may have exit rights that would require us to purchase their interests upon the occurrence of certain events, which could impact our financial condition by requiring us to incur additional indebtedness in order to complete such transactions or, alternatively, in some cases we may have the option to issue shares of our common stock to our joint venture partners to satisfy such obligations, which would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders.\n\u00b7\nOur joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.\n\u00b7\nAny sale or other disposition of our interest in a joint venture or underlying assets of the joint venture may require consents from our joint venture partners, which we may not be able to obtain.\n\u00b7\nCertain corporate-wide or strategic transactions may also trigger other contractual rights held by a joint venture partner (including termination or liquidation rights) depending on how the transaction is structured, which could impact our ability to complete such transactions.\nThe put/call arrangements set forth in the Put/Call Agreement (as defined below) may require us to utilize our cash flow or incur additional indebtedness to satisfy the payment obligations in respect of such arrangements.\nOn June 16, 2015, we entered into a Contribution and Purchase Agreement (the \u201cContribution and Purchase Agreement\u201d) with USPI Group Holdings, Inc. (\u201cUSPI Holdings\u201d), Ulysses JV Holding I L.P. (\u201cUlysses Holding I\u201d), Ulysses JV Holding II L.P. (\u201cUlysses Holding II\u201d and, together with Ulysses Holding I, the \u201cUSPI LPs\u201d), and the newly formed USPI Holding Company, Inc., our USPI joint venture. USPI Holdings is the parent company of United Surgical Partners International, Inc. USPI Holdings, through USPI and its other subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of owning and managing ambulatory surgery centers, surgical hospitals and related businesses. Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution and Purchase Agreement, at the closing, the USPI LPs collectively sold and contributed 100% of the equity interests of USPI Holdings to the USPI joint venture in exchange for certain shares of common stock of the USPI joint venture (the \u201cUSPI Contribution\u201d), and we sold and contributed certain of our equity interests and other assets that comprised a portion of our ambulatory surgery center and imaging center business to the USPI joint venture (the \u201cTenet Contribution\u201d and, together with the USPI Contribution, the \u201cContributions\u201d).We also purchased certain shares of the USPI joint venture (the \u201cPurchase\u201d and, together with the Contributions, the \u201cContribution and Purchase Transactions\u201d) from the USPI LPs such that, after giving effect to the Contribution and Purchase Transactions, we owned 50.1% and the USPI LPs, in the aggregate, owned 49.9% of the fully diluted equity interests of the USPI joint venture. In December 2015, the USPI LPs sold 3.01% of the fully diluted equity interests of the USPI joint venture to Baylor University Medical Center.\nIn connection with the Contribution and Purchase Agreement, we, the USPI LPs and the USPI joint venture entered into a stockholders agreement pursuant to which we and the USPI LPs agreed to certain rights and obligations with respect to the governance of the USPI joint venture. In addition, we entered into a put/call agreement (the \u201cPut/Call Agreement\u201d) that contains put and call options with respect to the equity interests in the USPI joint venture held by the USPI LPs. Each year starting in 2016, the USPI LPs must put to us at least 12.5%, and may put up to 25%, of the USPI joint venture shares held by them immediately after the closing of the Contribution and Purchase Agreement. In each year that the USPI LPs are to deliver a put and do not put the full 25% of USPI joint venture shares allowable, we may call the difference between the number of USPI joint venture shares the USPI LPs put and the maximum number of USPI joint venture shares the USPI LPs could have put that year. In addition, the Put/Call Agreement contains certain other call options pursuant to which we will have the ability to acquire all of the ownership interests held by the USPI LPs by 2020. In the event of a put by the USPI LPs, we will have the ability to choose whether to settle the purchase price in cash or shares\nof our common stock and, in the event of a call by us, the USPI LPs will have the ability to choose whether to settle the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock.\nWe have also entered into a separate put/call agreement (the \u201cBaylor Put/Call Agreement\u201d) with Baylor that contains put and call options with respect to the equity interests in the USPI joint venture held by Baylor. Each year starting in 2021, Baylor may put up to 33.3% of their total shares in the USPI joint venture held as of January 1, 2017. In each year that Baylor does not put the full 33.3% of the USPI joint venture\u2019s shares allowable, we may call the difference between the number of shares Baylor put and the maximum number of shares they could have put that year. In addition, the Baylor Put/Call Agreement contains a call option pursuant to which we have the ability to acquire all of Baylor\u2019s ownership interest by 2024. We have the ability to choose whether to settle the purchase price for the Baylor put/call in cash or shares of our common stock.\nThe put and call arrangements described above, to the extent settled in cash, may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to satisfy our payment obligations in respect of such arrangements, which may reduce the amount of funds available for our operations, capital expenditures and corporate development activities. Similarly, we may be required to incur additional indebtedness to satisfy our payment obligations in respect of such arrangements, which could have important consequences to our business and operations, as described more fully below under \u201c-Our level of indebtedness could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.\u201d\nEconomic factors have affected, and may continue to impact, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe broad economic factors - including high unemployment rates in some of the markets our facilities serve and instability in consumer spending - have affected our volumes and our ability to collect outstanding receivables. The United States economy remains unpredictable. If industry trends (including reductions in commercial managed care enrollment and patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and non-emergency healthcare procedures) or general economic conditions worsen, we may not be able to sustain future profitability, and our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed.\nFurthermore, the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many business operations worldwide has been limited in recent years. Our ability to access the capital markets on acceptable terms may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have a negative impact on our growth plans, our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions, and our ability to refinance existing debt. An economic downturn or other economic conditions could also adversely affect the counterparties to our agreements, including the lenders under our credit facilities, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.\nTrends affecting our actual or anticipated results may require us to record charges that would negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs a result of factors that have negatively affected our industry generally and our business specifically, we have been required to record various charges in our results of operations. Our impairment tests presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining operating results in our hospitals, which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospitals\u2019 most recent projections. If these projections are not met, or negative trends occur that impact our future outlook, future impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill may occur, and we may incur additional restructuring charges. Future restructuring of our operating structure that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in future impairments of our goodwill. Any such charges could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur level of indebtedness could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $14.4 billion of total long-term debt, as well as approximately $110 million in standby letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate, under our senior secured revolving credit facility (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) and our letter of credit facility agreement (\u201cLC Facility\u201d). Our Credit Agreement is collateralized by patient accounts receivable of substantially all of our domestic wholly owned acute care and specialty hospitals, and our LC Facility is guaranteed and secured by a first priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of our hospital subsidiaries on an equal ranking basis with our existing senior secured notes. From time to time, we expect to engage in additional capital market, bank credit and other financing activities, depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7\nOur substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\n\u00b7\nWe may be more vulnerable in the event of a deterioration in our business, in the healthcare industry or in the economy generally, or if federal or state governments substantially limit or reduce reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs.\n\u00b7\nOur debt service obligations reduce the amount of funds available for our operations, capital expenditures and corporate development activities, and may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.\n\u00b7\nOur substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future capital expenditures, working capital, acquisitions or other needs.\n\u00b7\nSome of our borrowings accrue interest at variable rates, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates.\nFurthermore, our Credit Agreement, LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain, and any future debt obligations may contain, covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and sell assets. See -\u201cRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may adversely affect us.\u201d\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIn addition, our ability to meet our debt service obligations is dependent upon the operating results of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us. We hold most of our assets at, and conduct most of our operations through, direct and indirect subsidiaries. Moreover, we are dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations, including payment on our outstanding debt. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and restrictions contained in agreements governing the debt of such subsidiaries. Our less than wholly owned subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to distribute cash to us in their financing or other agreements and, as a result, we may not be able to access their cash flows to service their respective debt obligations.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, including those required for operating our existing hospitals, for integrating our historical acquisitions or for future corporate development activities. We also may be forced to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our Credit Agreement, LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may adversely affect us.\nOur Credit Agreement, LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u00b7\nincur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nincur liens;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments;\n\u00b7\nprovide subsidiary guarantees;\n\u00b7\nconsummate asset sales;\n\u00b7\nredeem debt that is subordinated in right of payment to outstanding indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nenter into sale and lease-back transactions;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.\nIn addition, so long as any obligation or commitment is outstanding under our Credit Agreement and LC Facility, the terms of such facilities require us to maintain a financial ratio relating to our ability to satisfy certain fixed expenses, including interest payments. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants and financial ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. In addition, a breach of any of these covenants could cause an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay the indebtedness immediately. Under these conditions, we are not certain whether we would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make accelerated payments.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement, LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. We may decide to incur additional secured or unsecured debt in the future to finance our operations and any judgments or settlements or for other business purposes.\nOur Credit Agreement provides for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1 billion, with a $300 million subfacility for standby letters of credit. Based on our eligible receivables, approximately $995 million was available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2015. Our LC Facility provides for the issuance of\nstandby and documentary letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to $180 million (subject to increase to up to $200 million). At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $105 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under the LC Facility. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nThe utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $1.8 billion pretax available to offset future taxable income. These NOL carryforwards will expire in the years 2024 to 2034. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a company\u2019s taxable income that may be offset by the NOL carryforwards if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when a company\u2019s \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the company by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. (This is different from a change in beneficial ownership under applicable securities laws.) These ownership changes include purchases of common stock under share repurchase programs, a company\u2019s offering of its stock, the purchase or sale of company stock by five-percent shareholders, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire company stock. While we expect to be able to realize our total NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, if an ownership change occurs, our ability to use the NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the NOL carryforwards. Furthermore, we could be required to record a valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOL carryforwards that may not be realized, which could adversely impact our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 52337, "SIC": 8062, "TIC": "THC"}
