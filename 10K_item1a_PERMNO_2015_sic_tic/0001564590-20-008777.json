{"cik": "1705843", "company": "Calyxt, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThis section includes a discussion of what we believe to be the most significant important factors that could affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future. You should carefully consider these risk factors in connection with Part 2, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations,\u201d the consolidated financials and the other information in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and may increase the risk of investment.\nWe are an early-stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history that to date has been focused primarily on R&D, conducting field trials, pursuing initial commercialization efforts and building our management team. Investment in plant-based technology product development is a highly speculative endeavor. It entails substantial upfront R&D investment and there is significant risk that we will not be able to edit the genes in a particular plant to express a desired trait, or, once edited, we will not be able to replicate that trait across entire crops in order to commercialize the product candidate. Moreover, the regulatory pathway for our product candidates can be uncertain and could add significant additional cost and time to development. Although we achieved commercialization in the first quarter of 2019, we have not yet generated significant revenue from sales of these products.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, such as the plant-based technology industry, including challenges in forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, gaining market acceptance of the products made using our gene-editing platform, managing a complex regulatory landscape and developing new product candidates. We may also face challenges in scaling our supply chain in a cost-effective manner, as we will rely on contracting with seed production companies, seed distributors, farmers, crushers, millers, refiners, and logistics and transportation providers, in order to get our products to market. Our current operating model may require changes for us to scale our operations efficiently. We may not be able to fully implement or execute on our business strategy or realize, in whole or in part within our expected time frames, the anticipated benefits of our growth strategies. You should consider our business and prospects considering the risks and difficulties we face as an early-stage company focused on developing products in the field of plant-based technology industry.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the next several years.\nOur net losses for the years ended December 31 were $39.6 million for 2019, $27.9 million for 2018 and $26.0 million for 2017. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $122.1 million. Although we began generating revenue in the first quarter of 2019 from sales of our high oleic soybean products, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years. The amount of our future losses will depend, in part, on our revenue associated with sales of our high oleic soybean products and expenses associated with our commercial operations, the expense associated with and timing of introduction of additional products from our pipeline of product candidates, expenses associated with acquisition or in-licensing of technologies, and the revenue associated with future products or licensed technologies. We do not expect commercial launches of our improved digestibility alfalfa product candidate before 2021 or our high fiber wheat product candidate before 2022.\nThe net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nWe cannot assure you that we will generate increases in our revenues, successfully commercialize other product candidates or generate revenue from licensing or attain a level of profitable operations. Based on our history of losses, we do not expect that we will be able to fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs through our cash balances and operating cash flow alone. To fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs, we expect we will need to secure additional capital. Our business plan and financing needs are subject to change depending on, among other things, the success of our efforts to grow revenue and our efforts to continue to effectively manage expenses.\nWe face significant competition and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do.\nThe market for plant-based technology products is highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition.\u201d. Mergers and acquisitions in the plant science, specialty food ingredient and agricultural biotechnology, seed and chemical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Most of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources than we do, such as larger R&D staff, more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and more well-established sales forces. As a result, we may be unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, which may result in price reductions, reduced margins and the inability to achieve market acceptance for our products. We expect to continue to face significant competition in the markets in which we intend to commercialize our products.\nMany of our competitors engage in ongoing R&D, and technological developments by our competitors could render our products less competitive or obsolete, resulting in reduced sales compared to our expectations. Our ability to compete effectively and to achieve commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: control manufacturing and marketing costs; effectively price and market our products; successfully develop an effective marketing program and an efficient supply chain; develop new products with properties attractive to customers; and commercialize our products quickly without incurring major regulatory costs. We may not be successful in achieving these factors and any such failure may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, certain seed and chemical companies that are potential competitors of ours may seek new traits or trait development technologies and may seek to license our technology. We have, in the past, entered such licensing arrangements and may continue to enter such arrangements in the future. Some of these companies may have significantly greater financial resources and may even compete with our business. In such circumstances, competitors could use our technologies to develop their own products that would compete with our products.\nWe also anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and new technologies become available, particularly in the area of gene editing. Our technology may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors that are more effective or that enable them to develop and commercialize products more quickly or with lower expense than we are able to. At the same time, the expiration of patents covering existing products reduces the barriers to entry for competitors. If for any reason our technology becomes obsolete or uneconomical relative to our competitors\u2019 technologies, this would prevent or limit our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of our products.\nOur business activities are currently conducted at a limited number of locations, which makes us susceptible to damage or business disruptions caused by natural disasters or acts of vandalism.\nOur current headquarters and R&D facilities, which include an office, labs, greenhouses, field testing acreage, and a demonstration test kitchen, are in Roseville, Minnesota. Our seed production takes place primarily in the United States and its territories with contra season production also occurring in Argentina. Third party warehousing for seed storage, and our limited number of processing partners (e.g. storage, transportation, crushers and refiners) are all located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States. We take precautions to safeguard our facilities, including insurance, health and safety protocols, and off-site storage of critical research results and computer data. Particularly in the case of insurance, our insurance may not cover certain losses, or our losses may exceed our coverage limits. A natural disaster, such as a hurricane, drought, fire, flood, tornado, earthquake, or other intentional or negligent acts, including acts of vandalism, could damage or destroy our equipment, inventory, development projects, field trials or data, and cause us to incur significant additional expenses to repair or replace the damaged physical facilities, which in the case of seed production may be the result of years of development work that is not easily or quickly reproduced, and increase the development schedule for our pipeline of product candidates.\nTo compete effectively, we must introduce new products that achieve market acceptance.\nIn order to remain competitive and increase revenue, we must introduce new products from our pipeline of product candidates. If we fail to anticipate or respond to technological developments, market requirements, or consumer preferences, or if we are significantly delayed in developing and introducing products, our revenues will not increase.\nDevelopment of successful agricultural products using gene-editing technologies requires significant levels of investment in R&D, including laboratory, greenhouse and field testing, to demonstrate product effectiveness and can take several years or more. We incurred R&D expenses, including non-cash stock compensation expenses, of $12.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, $10.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, and $11.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. We must commit significant resources and may incur obligations (such as royalty obligations or milestone fees) to develop new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept and without knowing the levels of revenue, if any, that may be derived from these products.\nDevelopment of new or improved agricultural products involves risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative and complex technologies. These risks include the possibility that:\n\u2022\nour products may not perform as expected in the field;\n\u2022\nour products may not receive necessary regulatory permits and governmental clearances in the markets in which we intend to sell them;\n\u2022\nconsumer preferences, which are unpredictable and can vary greatly, may change quickly, making our products no longer desirable;\n\u2022\nour competitors may develop new products that taste better or have other more appealing characteristics than our products;\n\u2022\nour products may be viewed as too expensive by our customers as compared to competitive products;\n\u2022\nour products may be difficult to produce on a large scale or may not be economical to grow;\n\u2022\nintellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties may prevent us or our collaborators from marketing and selling our products;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to patent or otherwise obtain intellectual property protection for our discoveries in the necessary jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nwe or our collaborators may be unable to fully develop or commercialize products in a timely manner or at all; and\n\u2022\nthird parties may develop superior or equivalent products.\nAccordingly, if we experience any significant delays in the development or introduction of new products or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we may enter in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may seek collaboration arrangements with third parties for the development or commercialization of our product candidates depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to entering collaboration arrangements. We will face, to the extent that we decide to enter collaboration arrangements, significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate, document, implement and maintain. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaboration or other alternative arrangements should we so chose to enter such arrangements. The terms of any collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\nThe success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our partners. Collaborations are subject to numerous risks, which may include that:\n\u2022\npartners have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that we will apply to R&D partnerships;\n\u2022\npartners may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\npartners may delay trials, provide insufficient funding for a trial program, stop a trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for testing;\n\u2022\npartners could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\na partner with marketing, manufacturing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit enough resources to or otherwise not perform satisfactorily in carrying out these activities;\n\u2022\nwe could grant exclusive rights to our partners that would prevent us from collaborating with others;\n\u2022\npartners may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and a partner that causes the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our current or future products or that results in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022\npartnerships may be terminated, and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable current or future products;\n\u2022\npartners may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our partnering with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to develop or commercialize such intellectual property; and\n\u2022\na partner\u2019s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not follow applicable laws resulting in civil or criminal proceedings.\nIf ongoing or future field trials are unsuccessful, we may be unable to complete the development of product candidates on a timely basis or at all.\nWe rely on field trials to demonstrate the efficacy of product candidates that we develop and evaluate in greenhouse conditions. Field trials allow us to test product candidates in the field as well as to increase seed production, and to measure performance across multiple geographies and conditions. Successful completion of field trials is critical to the success of our product development efforts. If our ongoing or future field trials are unsuccessful or produce inconsistent results or unanticipated adverse effects on the agronomic performance of our crops, or if the field trials do not produce reliable data, our product development efforts could be delayed, subject to additional regulatory review or abandoned entirely. In addition, in order to support our commercialization efforts, it is necessary to collect data across multiple growing seasons and from different geographies. Even in cases where initial field trials are successful, we cannot be certain that additional field trials conducted on a greater number of acres or in different geographies will also be successful. Many factors that are beyond our control may adversely affect the success of these field trials, including unique geographic conditions, weather and climatic variations, disease or pests, or acts of protest or vandalism. Field trials, which may take up to two to three years, are costly, and any field trial failures that we may experience may not be covered by insurance and, therefore, could result in increased costs, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. During the first quarter of 2020, we were notified that a significant portion of our high fiber wheat plants were lost in field trials due to improper aerial chemical applications by unaffiliated third parties. While we are continuing to assess the impact of this loss on the overall development process and timeline, we expect to harvest the remaining field trial crop in spring 2020 and continue Phase II development in 2020. Our Phase II development activities in 2020 will include testing the product concept in field conditions, completing food application studies and voluntarily consulting with FDA. Depending on the results of the spring 2020 field trial crop harvest and the success of our other activities in Phase II and Phase III, our high fiber wheat product may launch as early as 2022.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct, monitor, support, and oversee field trials and other research services for product candidates in development, and any performance issues by third parties, or our inability to engage third parties on acceptable terms, may impact our ability to successfully commercialize such product candidates.\nWe currently rely on third parties, such as growers, consultants, contractors and universities, to conduct, monitor, support and oversee these field trials. In some cases, these field trials are conducted outside of the United States, making it difficult for us to monitor the work being conducted by the third parties that we engage. Although we provide our third-party contractors with protocols regarding the production and handing of our product candidates, we have limited control over the execution of field trials. Poor field trial execution or data collection, failure to follow required agronomic practices, protocols or regulatory requirements, or mishandling of product candidates by these third parties could impair the success of our field trials. Any such failures may result in delays in the development of our product candidates or the incurrence of additional costs. Even if our third-party contractors adhere to our suggested protocols, field trials may fail to succeed for a variety of other reasons, including weather, disease or pests, improper timing of planting our seeds, or incorrect fertilizer use. Ultimately, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our field trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our responsibilities. Should such third parties fail to comply with these standards, our ability to develop our product candidates could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to maintain or enter into agreements with third-party contractors on acceptable terms, or if engagement is terminated prematurely, we may be unable to conduct or complete our field trials in the manner we anticipate. If our relationship with any of these third-party contractors is terminated, we may be unable to enter arrangements with alternative contractors on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Switching or adding third-party contractors can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when any new third party commences field trial work. As a result, delays may occur, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired development timelines.\nThe successful commercialization of our products depends on our ability to produce high-quality plants and seeds cost-effectively on a large scale and to accurately forecast demand for our products, and we may be unable to do so.\nThe production of commercial-scale quantities of seeds requires the multiplication of the plants or seeds through a succession of plantings and seed harvests. The cost-effective production of high-quality, high-volume quantities of any product candidates we successfully develop depends on our ability to scale our production processes to produce plants and seeds in enough quantity to meet demand. For example, food ingredients such as soybean oil and wheat flour will require optimized production and commercialization of the underlying plant and seed harvests. We cannot assure that our existing or future seed production techniques will enable us to meet our large-scale production goals cost-effectively for the products in our pipeline. Even if we are successful in developing ways to increase yields and enhance quality, we may not be able to do so cost-effectively or on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to maintain or enhance the quality of our plants and seeds as we increase our production capacity, including through the expected use of third parties, we may experience reductions in customer or farmer demand, higher costs and increased inventory write-offs.\nIn addition, because of the length of time it takes to produce commercial quantities of marketable seeds, we will need to make seed production decisions well in advance of product sales. Our ability to accurately forecast supply can be adversely affected by several factors outside of our control, including changes in market conditions, environmental factors, such as pests and diseases, and adverse weather conditions. A shortfall in the supply of our products may reduce product revenue, damage our reputation in the market and adversely affect relationships. Any product surplus we have on hand may negatively impact cash flows, reduce the quality of our inventory and ultimately result in write-offs of inventory. Additionally, we will take financial risk in our inventory given that we will have to keep the inventory at its net realizable value on our balance sheet. Fluctuations in the spot price of our crops in inventory could have negative impacts on our consolidated financial statements. Any failure on our part to produce enough inventory, or overproduction of a product, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, request a decrease in quantity, or make returns, which may lead to a surplus of our products.\nWhile we estimate that the potential size of our target markets for our products is significant, that estimate has not been independently verified and is based on certain assumptions that may not prove to be accurate. Our ability to accurately forecast demand is dependent on the timing of customer decisions, qualification cycles, and other factors outside of our control. As a result, these estimates could differ materially from actual market sizes, which could result in decreased demand for our products and therefore adversely impact our future business prospects, results of operation and financial condition.\nInterruptions in the production or transportation of our seeds could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe rely on contract seed producers to produce seed for our product candidates. Poor execution, failure to follow required agronomic practices, protocols or regulatory requirements, or mishandling of product candidates by these contract seed producers could adversely affect our products. Any such failures may result in delays in our ability to obtain seed for our seed production needs in a timely manner. Such delays could adversely affect our ability to deliver seed to farmers to meet their planting window. Our dependency upon timely seed deliveries means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries, or delays or limitations with respect to seed production, could adversely affect our operations until alternative arrangements could be made. Such a delay would adversely affect our reputation and revenues. If we were unable to produce the necessary seed for an extended period for any reason, our business, customer relations, and operating results could suffer.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable seed producers to meet our production needs or we may not be able to enter into cost effective agreements with suitable seed producers on acceptable terms. If any contract seed producers whom we engage fail to perform their obligations as expected or breach or terminate their agreements with us, or if we are unable to secure the services of such third parties when and as needed, it may adversely affect our business.\nThe unintended presence of our traits in other products or plants may negatively affect us.\nTrace amounts of our traits may unintentionally be found in the products of third parties, which may result in negative publicity and claims of liability brought by such third parties or others against us. Furthermore, in the event of an unintended dissemination of our gene-edited germplasm into the environment, or the presence of unintended trace amounts of our traits in conventional seed, or in the grain or products produced from conventional crops, we could be subject to claims by multiple parties, including environmental advocacy groups, as well as governmental actions such as mandated crop destruction, product recalls, or additional stewardship practices and environmental cleanup or monitoring.\nThe successful commercialization of our products may face challenges from public perceptions of gene-edited products and ethical, legal, environmental, health and social concerns.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates depends, in part, on public acceptance of gene-edited agricultural products.\nConsumers may not understand the nature of our technologies or the scientific distinction between our non-transgenic gene-edited products and transgenic products of competitors. As a result, they may transfer negative perceptions and attitudes regarding transgenic products to our products and product candidates. A lack of understanding of our technologies may also make consumers more susceptible to the influence of negative information provided by opponents of biotechnology. Some opponents of biotechnology actively seek to raise public concern about gene editing, whether transgenic or non-transgenic, by claiming that plant products developed using biotechnology are unsafe for consumption or their use, pose a risk of damage to the environment, or creates legal, social and ethical dilemmas. The commercial success of our products and product candidates may be adversely affected by such claims, even if unsubstantiated. In addition, opponents of biotechnology have vandalized the fields of farmers planting biotech seeds and facilities used by biotechnology companies. Any such acts of vandalism targeting the fields of our farmers, our field-testing sites or our research, production or other facilities, could adversely affect our sales and our costs.\nNegative public perceptions about gene editing can also affect the regulatory environment in the jurisdictions in which we are targeting the sale of our products and the commercialization of our product candidates. Any increase in such negative perceptions or any restrictive government regulations in response thereto, could have a negative effect on our business and may delay or impair the sale of our products or the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Even in light of compliance with regulatory protocols or following receipt of confirmation of non-regulated status in a jurisdiction, public pressure may lead to increased regulation of products produced using biotechnology, further legislation regarding novel trait development technologies, or administrative litigation concerning prior regulatory determinations, each of which could adversely affect our ability to sell our product or commercialize our product candidates. In addition, labeling requirements could heighten public concerns and make consumers less likely to purchase food products containing gene-edited ingredients.\nAdditionally, we are currently exploring product opportunities in hemp, among other crops. Hemp, as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill as Cannabis sativa containing a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis, has been removed from the Controlled Substances Act and is legally distinct from marijuana/cannabis, which is Cannabis sativa containing a THC concentration of more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. Because the hemp plant and the marijuana plant are both part of the same cannabis sativa species of plant, our activities with legal hemp may be incorrectly perceived as us being involved in federally illegal cannabis/marijuana. Also, despite growing support for the cannabis industry and legalization of cannabis in certain states in the United States, many individuals and businesses remain opposed to the cannabis industry. Any negative press resulting from any incorrect perception that we have entered the cannabis space could result in a loss of current or future business. It could also adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us and lead to reluctance by new parties to do business with us or to own our common stock. Business partners, including but not limited to financial institutions and customers, may attempt to end or limit their relationships with us due to this incorrect perception, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or animals are injured.\nWe are targeting sale of our high oleic soybean oil as a premium oil in the foodservice, food manufacturing, animal nutrition, and industrial market segments. We sell our high oleic soybean meal into the animal nutrition market segment. We may need to recall our high oleic soybean products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer or purchaser confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and the value of our brands.\nProducts that we develop, and food containing our products, may fail to meet standards established by third-party non-GMO verification organizations, which could reduce the value of our products to customers.\nCertain third-party organizations offer verification programs that seek to identify non-GMO products to consumers. These organizations verify the status of products (such as foods, beverages and vitamins) as non-GMO based on independently developed standards, and often authorize the display of specific markers or labels illustrating such status on the verified product\u2019s packaging. Standards established by such third-party organizations for the verification of non-GMO status may differ from applicable regulatory legal standards applied by regulators in the United States. As a result, notwithstanding a determination as to the non-regulated status of a product pursuant to APHIS\u2019s regulatory procedures (or a similar determination in other jurisdictions), our products, and third-party products that utilize our gene-edited products as ingredients, may fail to meet more restrictive or non-scientific standards imposed by these independent verification organizations.\nFor example, there are third-party verification organizations that withhold non-GMO certification from products developed using gene editing technology, including a product that does not contain any foreign DNA, such as our high oleic soybean. Such a position means that some non-GMO seals or labels are not available for gene edited products, including our high oleic soybean products. This has limited our ability to demand non-GMO premiums for our high oleic soybean meal.\nIf we are sued for defective products and if such lawsuits were determined adversely, we could be subject to substantial damages, for which insurance coverage is not available.\nWe may be held liable if any product we develop, or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies, is found unsuitable during marketing, sale or consumption. For example, the detection of an unintended trait in a commercial seed variety or the crops and products produced may result in governmental actions such as mandated crop destruction, product recalls or environmental cleanup or monitoring. Concerns about seed quality could also lead to additional regulations being imposed on our business, such as regulations related to testing procedures, mandatory governmental reviews of biotechnology advances, or additional regulations relating to the integrity of the food supply chain from the farm to the finished product.\nWe may need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $58.6 million. We believe our cash and cash equivalents will be enough to fund our operations into mid-2021.\nOur business plan is to complete the development and regulatory processes for our product candidates and commercialize additional product candidates. Based on our history of losses, we do not expect that we will be able to fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs to execute our business plan and pursue our strategic goals through our cash balances and operating cash flow alone. To fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs, we expect we will need to secure additional capital. Our business plan and financing needs are subject to change depending on, among other things, success of our product development efforts, our revenue and our efforts to continue to effectively manage expenses. If we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenue to meet our financial targets, become profitable and have sustainable positive cash flows, we may be required to further reduce expenses, which could have a further negative effect on our ability to generate revenue, or we may be required to raise additional capital more quickly than we expect or we may need more capital than we expect.\nWe may obtain future additional financing by incurring indebtedness or from an offering of our equity or convertible securities or both. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or convertible securities, current ownership interests will be diluted, and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and a portion of our operating cash flows, if any, being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness. In addition, debt financing may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that impose operating restrictions, such as restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, the making of certain capital expenditures or the declaration of dividends. If we raise capital in the future, we cannot assure you that additional capital will be available in the amount or at the time we need it, or that it will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or product candidate development programs or the commercialization of any product candidate or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, operating results and prospects and cause the price of the common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe overall agricultural industry is susceptible to commodity price changes and we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices.\nChanges in the prices of commodities products could result in higher overall cost along the agricultural supply chain, which may negatively affect our ability to commercialize our products. We will be susceptible to changes in costs in the agricultural industry as a result of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations. As a result, we may not be able to anticipate or react to changing costs by adjusting our practices, which could cause our operating results to deteriorate. While we manage our exposure to changing commodity prices underlying sales contracts and supply agreements for grain and seed production by entering into commodity derivative transactions, those activities may not provide full mitigation of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, and as a result our results of operations and financial condition may be affected. See Item 7A \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, crop disease, pests and other natural conditions can impose significant costs and losses on our business.\nA farmer\u2019s ability to grow our products is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common but difficult to predict, the effects of which may be influenced and intensified by ongoing global climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. This risk is particularly acute with respect to the Upper Midwest region of the United States in which we currently source our high oleic soybean grain. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Such adverse conditions can result in harvesting delays or loss of crops for farmers and cause us to be delayed, or to fail entirely in delivering product to customers, resulting in loss of revenue. Furthermore, significant fluctuations in market prices for agricultural inputs and crops could also have an adverse effect on the prices of our products.\nThe ability to grow our products is also vulnerable to crop disease and to pests, which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied, climatic conditions and the risks associated with ongoing global climate change. The costs to control disease and other infestations vary depending on the severity of the damage and the extent of the plantings affected. Moreover, there can be no assurance that available technologies to control such infestations will continue to be effective. These infestations can also increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nThe regulatory environment in the United States for our current and future products is uncertain and evolving.\nChanges in applicable regulatory requirements could result in a substantial increase in the time and costs associated with developing our products and negatively impact our operating results. While the USDA and FDA currently have petition processes that we have successfully completed in the past, these processes and the manner in which the USDA and FDA interpret their own regulations may change in the future, negatively impacting our speed to market and cost to launch product candidates. We cannot predict whether advocacy groups will challenge existing regulations and USDA or FDA determinations or whether the USDA or FDA will alter the manner in which it interprets its own regulations or institutes new regulations, or otherwise modifies regulations in a way that will subject our products to more burdensome standards, thereby substantially increasing the time and costs associated with developing our product candidates.\nAdditionally, we are currently exploring product opportunities in hemp, among other crops. Hemp is legally distinct from marijuana and recognized as an agricultural crop by the United States government. Federal and state laws and regulations on hemp address production, monitoring, manufacturing, distribution, and laboratory testing to ensure that that the hemp has a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. Federal laws and regulations may also address the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products. As we continue to explore hemp as a product candidate, we may become subject to increasing regulation particular to hemp, which could require us to incur additional costs associated with compliance requirements.\nThe regulatory environment outside the United States varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and there is less certainty how our products will be regulated.\nThe regulatory environment around gene editing in plants for food ingredients is greatly uncertain outside of the United States and varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction may have its own regulatory framework regarding genetically modified foods, which may include restrictions and regulations on planting and growing genetically modified plants and in the consumption and labeling of genetically modified foods, and which may encapsulate our products. To the extent regulatory frameworks outside of the United States are not receptive to our gene-editing technologies, this may limit our ability to expand into other global markets.\nComplying with the regulatory requirements outside the United States will be costly and time-consuming, and there is no guarantee we will be able to commercialize our products outside the United States.\nWe cannot predict whether or when any jurisdiction will change its regulations with respect to our products. Advocacy groups have engaged in publicity campaigns and filed lawsuits in various countries against companies and regulatory authorities, seeking to halt regulatory approval or clearance activities or influence public opinion against genetically engineered and/or gene-edited products. In addition, governmental reaction to negative publicity concerning our products could result in greater regulation of genetic research and derivative products or regulatory costs that render our products cost prohibitive,\nThe scale of the commodity food industry may make it difficult to monitor and control the distribution of our products. As a result, our products may be sold inadvertently within jurisdictions where they are not approved for distribution. Such sales may lead to regulatory challenges or lawsuits against us, which could result in significant expenses and management attention.\nGovernment policies and regulations, particularly those affecting the agricultural sector and related industries, could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nAgricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies and regulations. Governmental policies and approvals of technologies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, and the volume and types of imports and exports. Future government policies in the United States or in other countries may discourage our customers from using our products or encourage the use of products more advantageous to our competitors, which would put us at a commercial disadvantage and could negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations.\nWe may use biological materials in our business and are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with such laws and regulations and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, the handling, use, storage, treatment, manufacture and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. Our R&D processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including biological materials. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, or may otherwise be required to remediate such contamination, and our liability may exceed any insurance coverage and our total assets. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may be expensive and may impair our R&D efforts. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs and liabilities, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance. In addition, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental, health and safety laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts or result in increased expense of compliance.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe license a significant portion of our intellectual property from Cellectis, our majority stockholder, and the University of Minnesota, and principally rely upon Cellectis to prosecute and defend such intellectual property.\nOur business relies heavily on the intellectual property we license from Cellectis and the University of Minnesota. If we do not comply with our obligations under the license agreements, we may be subject to damages, which may be significant, and in some cases Cellectis and/or the University of Minnesota may have the right to terminate the license agreement. Any termination of our license agreement with Cellectis or the University of Minnesota would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nMoreover, any enforcement of the licensed intellectual property could subject it to challenge by third parties and if any such challenge is successful, such intellectual property could be narrowed in scope or held to be invalid or unenforceable, which would materially impair any competitive advantage afforded to us by such intellectual property. There can be no assurance that Cellectis or the University of Minnesota will prosecute and maintain such intellectual property in the best interests of our business or at all, and, if Cellectis or the University of Minnesota fails to properly prosecute and maintain such intellectual property, we could lose our rights to such intellectual property, which would materially impair any competitive advantage afforded to us by such intellectual property. For more information regarding our license agreement with Cellectis or the license agreement between Cellectis and the University of Minnesota, please see \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property.\u201d\nPatents and patent applications involve highly complex legal and factual questions, which, if determined adversely to us, could negatively impact our competitive position.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology companies and other actors in our fields of business can be highly uncertain and involve complex scientific, legal and factual analyses. The interpretation and breadth of claims allowed in some patents covering biological compositions may be uncertain and difficult to determine and are often affected materially by the facts and circumstances that pertain to the patented compositions and the related patent claims. The standards of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and foreign patent offices are sometimes uncertain and could change in the future. Consequently, the issuance and scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated, narrowed or circumvented. United States patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, and United States patents may be subject to reexamination proceedings, post-grant review, inter partes review, or other administrative proceedings in the USPTO. Foreign patents as well may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in corresponding foreign patent offices. Challenges to our or our licensors\u2019 patents and patent applications, if successful, may result in the denial of our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications or the loss or reduction in their scope. In addition, such interference, reexamination, post-grant review, inter partes review, opposition proceedings and other administrative proceedings may be costly and involve the diversion of significant management time. Accordingly, rights under any of our or our licensors\u2019 patents may not provide us with enough protection against competitive products or processes and any loss, denial or reduction in scope of any of such patents and patent applications may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEven if not challenged, our or our licensors\u2019 patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our product candidates or technology or prevent others from designing their products or technology to avoid being covered by our or our licensors\u2019 patent claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we own or license with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could dissuade companies from partnering with us to develop, and could threaten our ability to successfully commercialize, our product candidates. Furthermore, for United States patent applications in which claims are entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or instituted by the USPTO in order to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by such patent claims.\nIn addition, changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws in the United States and other countries may permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products without providing any notice or compensation to us, or may limit the scope of patent protection that we or our licensors are able to obtain. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights.\nIf we or our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection of our product candidates and technology, we could lose our competitive advantage and competition we face would increase, reducing any potential revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will not seek to protect our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions throughout the world and we may not be able to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights even in the jurisdictions where we seek protection.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States could be less extensive than those in the United States, assuming that rights are obtained in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions.\nCompetitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we or our licensors do not pursue and obtain patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we or our licensors have patent protection, but where the ability to enforce our or our licensors\u2019 patent rights is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our intellectual property rights and such rights may not be effective or enough to prevent such competition.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Patent protection must be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we and our licensors may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries. In addition, the legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to biotechnologies. The requirements for patentability differ from country to country, and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, to the same extent as federal and state laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. These realities may make it difficult for us to stop the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights. Many foreign countries, including the EU countries, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our and our licensors\u2019 efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license. Similarly, if our trade secrets are disclosed in a foreign jurisdiction, competitors worldwide could have access to our proprietary information, and we may be without satisfactory recourse. Such disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws.\nFurthermore, proceedings to enforce our licensors\u2019 and our patent rights and other intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our or our licensors\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded to us, if any, may not be commercially meaningful, while the damages and other remedies we may be ordered to pay such third parties may be significant. Accordingly, our licensors\u2019 and our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nThird parties may assert rights to inventions we develop or otherwise regard as our own.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property. We have written agreements with R&D partners that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from our strategic alliances. These agreements provide that we must negotiate certain commercial rights with such partners with respect to joint inventions or inventions made by our partners that arise from the results of the strategic alliance. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address clearly the allocation of intellectual property rights that may arise from the respective alliance. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third-party partner\u2019s materials when required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed through the use of a partner\u2019s samples, we may be limited in our ability to capitalize on the full market potential of these inventions. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors, or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective, or are in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and could interfere with our ability to capture the full commercial value of such inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property and associated products and technology or may lose our rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, the research resulting in certain of our in-licensed patent rights and technology was funded in part by the United States government. As a result, the United States government has certain rights to such patent rights and technology, which include march-in rights. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention or to have others use the invention on its behalf. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, or because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to the United States industry. Any exercise by the government of any of the foregoing rights could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny infringement, misappropriation or other violation by us of intellectual property rights of others may prevent or delay our product development efforts and may prevent or increase the costs of our successfully commercializing our product candidates, if approved.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot assure that our business operations, products, product candidates and methods and the business operations, products, product candidates and methods of our partners do not or will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe biotechnology industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may allege that our products, product candidates or the use of our technologies infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate patent claims or other intellectual property rights held by them or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. Patent and other types of intellectual property litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and their outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to intellectual property infringement that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we or our partners are found to be willfully infringing another party\u2019s patents, for past use of the asserted intellectual property and royalties and other consideration going forward if we are forced to take a license. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property rights or technologies licensed to us. In addition, if any such claim were successfully asserted against us and we could not obtain a license, we or our partners may be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, selling or otherwise commercializing our products, product candidates or other infringing technology, or those we develop with our R&D partners.\nEven if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court, or redesign our products. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have enough resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease developing, selling or otherwise commercializing our product candidates;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\u2022\nin the case of trademark claims, redesign, or rename trademarks we may own, to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may not be possible and, even if possible, could be costly and time-consuming.\nAny of these risks coming to fruition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing, licensing or acquiring intellectual property that may be required to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nOur programs may involve additional product candidates that may require the use of intellectual property or proprietary rights held by third parties; the growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these intellectual property and proprietary rights. However, we may be unable to acquire or in-license any third-party intellectual property or proprietary rights that may be key to development. Even if we can acquire or in-license such rights, we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and agricultural development and commercialization capabilities.\nWe sometimes partner with academic institutions to accelerate our research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the strategic alliance. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms that are acceptable to us, and the institution may license such intellectual property rights to third parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our development and commercialization plans.\nFurther, our consulting agreement with Dr. Voytas generally obligates Dr. Voytas to assign to us any intellectual property solely or jointly conceived, developed or reduced to practice by him in the course of the performance of his services to us. However, we do not have any rights, including any assignment or right of first refusal rights, to intellectual property conceived, developed or reduced to practice by Dr. Voytas outside the course of the performance of his services to us, including in connection with his employment at the University of Minnesota.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license intellectual property and proprietary rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. If we are unable to successfully acquire or in-license rights to required third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights or maintain the existing intellectual property and proprietary rights we have, we may have to cease development of the relevant program, product or product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Operation\nWe will need to develop and expand our company, and we may encounter difficulties in managing this development and expansion, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 75 employees. Effective with the end of the third quarter of 2019, we have internalized nearly all the management services Cellectis previously provided pursuant to our management services agreement with Cellectis. We expect to increase our number of employees and the scope and location of our operations as we continue to internally develop the managerial, operational and financial systems necessary to operate as a standalone company and to recruit and train additional qualified personnel to conduct our commercial operations that began in late February 2019 with the first sales of our high oleic soybean products and to further develop our pipeline of product candidates. Members of our management team may need to divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from their day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to execute our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company.\nWe depend on key management personnel and attracting and retaining other qualified personnel, and our business could be harmed if we lose key management personnel or cannot attract and retain other qualified personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the technical skills and continued service of certain members of our management and other key employees. Additionally, Dr. Dan Voytas, our Chief Science Officer, works for us as a consultant pursuant to a consulting agreement under which he is required to work 10 days per month with us. Accordingly, we may, from time to time, compete with Dr. Voytas\u2019 other professional activities for his time and attention. The loss of the services of our management or key employees or Dr. Voytas may delay or prevent the timely and successful execution of our business strategies and objectives. Additionally, the majority of our personnel is involved in research, development, and regulatory activities and competition for these highly skilled employees is intense. Our business is therefore dependent on our ability to recruit and maintain a highly skilled and educated workforce with expertise in a range of disciplines, including biology, biochemistry, plant genetics, agronomics, mathematics, agribusiness, and other subjects relevant to our operations. All our current employees are at-will employees, and the failure to retain or hire skilled and highly educated personnel could limit our growth and hinder our research and development efforts. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our cyber-security.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, and the data transmitted across these systems, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of data loss or a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations or loss of our data, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of field trial data from completed or ongoing or planned field trials could result in delays in our regulatory clearance and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data and add additional time to our product development timelines. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, damage to our reputation, and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Cellectis\nCellectis controls the direction of our business, and the concentrated ownership of our common stock and certain contractual rights Cellectis has will prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Cellectis owned 68.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Pursuant to our stockholders\u2019 agreement, Cellectis will have certain contractual rights for so long as it beneficially owns at least 50% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\nto approve any modification to our or any future subsidiary\u2019s share capital (e.g., share capital increase or decrease), the creation of any subsidiary, any grant of stock-based compensation, any distributions or public or private offering, merger, spin-off, liquidation, winding up or carve-out transactions;\n\u2022\nto approve the annual business plan and annual budget and any modification thereof;\n\u2022\nto approve any external growth transactions exceeding $500,000 and not included in the approved annual business plan and annual budget;\n\u2022\nto approve any investment and disposition decisions exceeding $500,000 and not included in the approved annual business plan and annual budget (it being understood that this clause excludes the purchase and sale of inventory as a part of the normal course of business);\n\u2022\nto approve any related-party agreement and any agreement or transaction between the executives or stockholders of Calyxt and Calyxt or any of its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nto approve any decision pertaining to the recruitment, dismissal/removal, or increase of the compensation of executives and corporate officers;\n\u2022\nto approve any material decision relating to a material litigation;\n\u2022\nto approve any decision relating to the opening of a social or restructuring plan or pre-insolvency proceedings;\n\u2022\nto approve any buyback by us of our own shares;\n\u2022\nto approve any new borrowings or debts exceeding $500,000 and early repayment of loans, if any (it being understood that Cellectis will approve the entering into of contracts for revolving loans and other short-term loans and the repayment of such for financing general operating activities, such as revolving loans for inventory or factoring of receivables);\n\u2022\nto approve grants of any pledges on our securities;\n\u2022\nto approve the development of any new activities and businesses not described in the annual business plan and annual budget;\n\u2022\nto approve entry into any material agreement or partnership; and\n\u2022\nto approve any offshore and relocation activities.\nIn addition, Cellectis will have the following rights for so long as it beneficially owns at least 15% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\nto nominate the greater of three members of our Board of Directors or a majority of the directors;\n\u2022\nto designate the Chairman of our Board of Directors and one member to each of the audit committee of the Board of Directors, the compensation committee of the Board of Directors and the nominating and corporation governance committee of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nto approve any amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws that would change the name of our company, its jurisdiction of incorporation, the location of its principal executive offices, the purpose or purposes for which our company is incorporated or the Cellectis approval items set forth in the stockholders\u2019 agreement;\n\u2022\nto approve the payment of any regular or special dividends;\n\u2022\nto approve the commencement of any voluntary proceeding for the dissolution, winding up or bankruptcy of Calyxt or a material subsidiary;\n\u2022\nto approve any public or private offering, merger, amalgamation or consolidation of us or the spinoff of a business of ours or any sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of our assets; and\n\u2022\nto approve any appointment to, or removal from, our Board of Directors.\nAs a result, Cellectis controls the direction of our business, and the concentrated ownership of our common stock and the contractual rights described above will prevent stockholders from influencing significant decisions.\nIf Cellectis sells a controlling interest in our company to a third party, stockholders may not realize any change-of-control premium on shares of our common stock.\nCellectis has the ability, should it choose to do so, to sell some or all its shares of our common stock to a third party, which, if sufficient in size, could result in a change of control of our company. In certain circumstances, a third-party buyer may not be willing to pay a premium over the current market price of our common stock in order to acquire a controlling interest in Calyxt. Our stockholders would not have the right to participate in Cellectis\u2019 sale of our common stock to a third party buyer nor would the third party buyer be required to make an offer to acquire shares of our common stock from any stockholder other than Cellectis.\nIf Cellectis sold a controlling interest to a third party, any change-of-control premium on shares of our common stock would only accrue to Cellectis and not to any of our other stockholders. Additionally, through its ownership of a majority of our common stock and its contractual rights under the stockholders\u2019 agreement, Cellectis will also determine whether a change of control of Calyxt occurs and if so, on what terms. In certain circumstances, including in connection with a proposed sale of Calyxt, Cellectis\u2019 interests as a stockholder of Calyxt may be different than the interests of other stockholders.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NASDAQ and, as a result, rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nBecause Cellectis controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NASDAQ. Under these rules, a listed company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have director nominees selected or recommended for the board\u2019s selection by a majority vote of only the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that our compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe are relying upon and expect to continue to rely upon some of these exemptions from the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. Accordingly, not all stockholders will have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all the corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ.\nCellectis and our directors who have relationships with Cellectis may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that none of Cellectis, or any of its officers, directors, agents, shareholders, members, partners, subsidiaries (other than Calyxt and any future subsidiaries) and their affiliates will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that Cellectis or any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to Cellectis or its affiliates instead of us, or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to us that such person or affiliate has directed to Cellectis or its affiliates.\nOur certificate of incorporation also provides that neither Cellectis nor any of its affiliates or any of our non-employee directors will have any duty to refrain from engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar lines of business in which we or any future subsidiaries now engage or propose to engage or otherwise competing with us or any of our future subsidiaries.\nOur license agreement with Cellectis does not restrict Cellectis from competing with us generally. Cellectis could develop and commercialize agricultural and food products that may compete with our current products or products in our pipeline using Cellectis intellectual property or technologies other than the gene-editing technologies Cellectis has licensed to us. Cellectis could also use the licensed gene-editing technologies to develop and commercialize products involving animals and animal cells and these animal-based products may be competitive with our plant-based products in certain circumstances.\nOne of our directors, Dr. Andr\u00e9 Choulika, is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cellectis and under the stockholders\u2019 agreement, Cellectis has the right to designate additional directors to serve on the Calyxt board of directors. Dr. Choulika and any other directors designated by Cellectis who have relationships with Cellectis will have fiduciary duties to us and in addition will have duties to Cellectis.\nAccordingly, there may be real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both us and Cellectis, whose interests, in some circumstances, may be different than the interests of other stockholders or our interests.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and could remain volatile, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility in response to various factors. Between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019, the sales price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market fluctuated from a high of $27.23 per share to a low of $3.55 per share. Some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include our quarterly operating results, our perceived prospects or the perceptions of the market of our pipeline, our new products or our technologies, changes in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations or earnings estimates and our ability to meet such estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, capital raising activity and other developments affecting us, our competitors or Cellectis.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their common stock at a favorable price or at all and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nOur historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe are a majority-owned subsidiary of Cellectis. As a result, our historical financial information does not reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company and not a subsidiary of Cellectis during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future. This is primarily the result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2019, our historical financial information reflects expense allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within Cellectis, such as expenses for business technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources and business development that may be higher or lower than the comparable expenses we would have actually incurred, or will incur in the future, as a standalone company;\n\u2022\nsignificant increases in our cost structure as a result of becoming a public company, including costs related to public company reporting, investor relations and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which expenses may increase at such time as we operate as a standalone company; and\n\u2022\nour direct costs for activities we are performing following their separation from Cellectis, reducing our management fee expense charged by Cellectis.\nAs a result of these matters, it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business.\nFuture sales of common stock by Cellectis or others of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Cellectis owned 68.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Future sales of these shares in the public market will be subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act for so long as Cellectis is deemed to be our affiliate, unless the shares to be sold are registered with the SEC. We are unable to predict with certainty whether or when Cellectis will sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock. The sale by Cellectis of a substantial number of shares, or a perception that such sales could occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe concentration of ownership of our common stock and provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nThe fact that Cellectis owns 68.9% of our common stock and Cellectis\u2019 rights under the stockholders\u2019 agreement to approve a sale of Calyxt and other changes in our Board of Directors and management will prevent a third party from attempting to acquire control of Calyxt and prevent changes in our Board of Directors or management, even if a sale of Calyxt or the changes would be considered beneficial by many stockholders other than Cellectis. Further, following the first date on which Cellectis no longer beneficially own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other agreements may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire or discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire control of Calyxt, including:\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our certificate of incorporation requiring the Board of Directors to be divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our bylaws regarding the business properly brought before our stockholders and the nomination of directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board of Directors to fix the designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our Certificate of Incorporating limiting the right of stockholders to remove directors; and\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our agreements provide for severance payments to our executive officers in the event of certain terminations following a \u201cchange in control\u201d\nFollowing the first date on which Cellectis no longer beneficially own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many stockholders, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, possibly depressing the market price of our common stock. As a result, stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares both while ownership of our common stock is concentrated with Cellectis and after.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and have reduced disclosure requirements that may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and not being required to submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden parachutes\u201d. If investors may find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on these exemptions and, as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 16818, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CLXT"}
