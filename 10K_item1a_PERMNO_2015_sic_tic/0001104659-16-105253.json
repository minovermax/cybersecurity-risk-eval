RISK FACTORS\nGeneral Risk Statement\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are driven by factors we cannot control or predict. An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The risks that we have highlighted here represent the material risks known to us, but they are not the only ones that we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows could be negatively affected. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe operate a global business that exposes us to currency, economic, regulatory and tax risks.\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from international sales and our growth strategy is largely focused on emerging markets. Our success delivering solutions and competing in international markets is subject to our ability to manage various risks and difficulties, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 our ability to effectively staff and manage operations in multiple countries;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 timely collecting of accounts receivable from customers located outside of the U.S.;\n\u00b7 our ability to repatriate cash from foreign locations;\n\u00b7 trade restrictions, political instability, disruptions in financial markets, and deterioration of economic conditions;\n\u00b7 compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 variations and changes in laws applicable to our operations in different jurisdictions, including enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\n\u00b7 compliance with export regulations, tariffs and other barriers;\n\u00b7 our ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations; and\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences in connection with repatriating funds.\nApproximately 40% of our revenue is transacted in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies (e.g. British Pound Sterling, Swiss Franc and Euro). As a result, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, our revenue, when converted to U.S. dollars, is reduced. At the same time, approximately 70% of our operating expenses originate overseas, the strengthening dollar conversely lowers expenses outside of the U.S. Although this has provided some defense against currency fluctuations for our bottom line results, we may not be able to maintain this ratio of revenue to expense in the future. In addition, we may not be able to sustain or increase our international revenue or repatriate cash without incurring substantial risks involving floating currency exchange rates, our ability to recover or apply withholding taxes remitted to foreign governments, and income tax expenses. Any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse impact on our international operations and, therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.\nOur revenue, earnings and profitability are affected by the length of our sales cycle, and a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is impacted by the length of our sales cycles. Our customers have relatively complex businesses and the purchase of large communications solutions used for enterprise-wide, mission-critical purposes, involve significant capital expenditures and lengthy implementation plans. Prospective customers often take a long period of time to evaluate our products and services and require us to spend substantial time, effort and money educating them about our solutions. The purchase of the types of products and services we offer typically also requires coordination and agreement across many departments within a potential customer\u2019s organization. This process often results in a lengthy sales cycle, typically ranging between three and twelve months. The lengthening of our sales cycle could reduce growth in our revenue and contribute to an increased cost of sales, thereby reducing our profitability.\nMergers and acquisitions of large communications companies, as well as the formation of new alliances, have resulted in a constantly changing marketplace for our products and services. Purchasing delays and pricing pressures associated with these changes are common. In addition, many of the companies in the communications industry have kept capital expenditures at historically low levels in response to changes in the communications marketplace; some companies have declared bankruptcy, cancelled contracts, delayed payments to their suppliers or delayed additional purchases.\nWe depend on a limited number of significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of one or more of these customers, or a delay in a large order, could adversely affect our business.\nWe earn a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers in the communications industry. The loss of any significant customer, delays in delivery or acceptance of any of our products by a customer, delays in the performance of services for a customer, or delays in collection of customer receivables could harm our business and operating results to a greater degree than other companies with a broader customer base.\nCustomers\u2019 budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews may cause potential customers to delay or forego a purchase, making it difficult for us to forecast the timing and size of our contracts. In addition, our sales opportunities in any given quarter and year typically include a few high value opportunities. The delay or failure to close one or more large orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cause our results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nWe incurred debt in connection with our recent acquisition of SSM which could adversely affect our financial condition and restrict our operating flexibility.\nIn connection with our acquisition of SSM in September 2015, we entered into a Third Amendment with East West Bank, increasing our revolving credit facility from $5.0 million to $10.0 million (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d) and we used the full amount of the Revolving Facility to fund the acquisition. The Revolving Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, including a pledge, subject to certain limitations with respect to stock of foreign subsidiaries, of the stock of the existing and future direct subsidiaries of the Company. There is no mandated borrowing required against the Revolving Facility. To take an advance under the Revolving Facility, the Company must have a balance of $4.0 million in cash on deposit with East West Bank, a minimum current ratio and a specified ratio of Total Liabilities to Tangible Net Worth, which are both as defined in the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility requires the Company to pay monthly payments of interest, with the unpaid balance due on October 22, 2016.\nOn February 29, 2016, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with East West Bank to enter into a Term Loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) for $6.0 million. The $6.0 million will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the U.S. Prime Rate plus 1.0%. The Term Loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of Evolving Systems, including a pledge, subject to certain limitations with respect to stock of foreign subsidiaries, of the stock of the existing and future direct subsidiaries of Evolving Systems. Interest shall accrue from the date the Term Loan is made at the aforementioned rate and shall be payable monthly. The Term Loan shall be repaid in 36 equal monthly installments of principal, plus accrued but unpaid interest, commencing on January 1, 2017 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter through and including January 1, 2020. On the Term Loan maturity date, the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be immediately due and payable. The Term Loan, once repaid, may not be reborrowed. We must maintain a minimum current ratio, a specified ratio of Total Liabilities to EBITDA and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are as defined in the Term Loan. The Term Loan requires us to pay two annual credit facility fees of $18,750 and legal fee equal to $1,000. The Term Loan agreement required us to use the term loans proceeds and $4.0 million from our cash balances to pay off the two existing Revolving Facilities totaling $10.0 million. The Term Loan matures on January 1, 2020.\nThe Revolving Facility includes negative covenants that place restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; create liens or other encumbrances on assets; make loans, enter into letters of credit, guarantees, investments and acquisitions; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; cause or permit a change of control; merge or consolidate with another entity; make negative pledges; enter into affiliate transactions; and change the nature of its business materially. Outstanding amounts under the Revolving Facility may be accelerated by notice from East West Bank upon the occurrence and continuance of certain events of default, including without limitation: payment defaults, breach of covenants beyond applicable grace periods, breach of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, and the occurrence of a material adverse effect (as defined). Acceleration is automatic upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency defaults.\nOur debt and related obligations, including interest payments, covenants and restrictions, could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7 reserving cash in order to satisfy the obligations relating to our debt could adversely affect the amount or timing of investments to grow our business, impairing our ability to invest in and successfully grow our business;\n\u00b7 our existing debt could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt obligations and other general corporate requirements;\n\u00b7 our debt may increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns, competition and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore we may be unable to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting; and\n\u00b7 the Revolving Facility imposes restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our business, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and sell assets.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Revolving Facility could result in an event of default and the acceleration of any debt then outstanding. Any declaration of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause our stock price to decline. Insufficient funds may require us to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our activities.\nAcquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.\nWe recently acquired SSM and we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. We cannot be sure that these transactions will ultimately enhance our products or strengthen our competitive position. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we get no satisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating operations, new technologies, products or employees, or that the transaction distracts management and employees from our other businesses. Furthermore, we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology, which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition. The success of these transactions will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the reduction of cash available for operations and the incurrence of debt. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.\nOur periodic workforce restructurings can be disruptive.\nWe have in the past restructured our workforce in response to management changes, acquisitions, product changes, performance issues or other considerations. These types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while our staff adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. There is no certainty that we will achieve the expected cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other adjustments to our business and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur products are complex and have a lengthy implementation process; unanticipated difficulties or delays in the customer acceptance process could result in higher costs and delayed payments.\nImplementing our solutions can be a relatively complex and lengthy process since we typically customize these solutions for each customer\u2019s unique environment. Often our customers also require rapid deployment of our software solutions, resulting in pressure on us to meet demanding delivery and implementation schedules. Inability to meet these demanding schedules, or quality issues resulting from accelerated delivery schedules, may result in customer dissatisfaction and/or damage our reputation, which could materially harm our business.\nThe majority of our existing contracts provide for acceptance testing by the customer, which can be a lengthy process. Unanticipated difficulties or delays in the customer acceptance process could result in higher costs, delayed payments, and deferral of revenue recognition. In addition, if our software contains defects or we otherwise fail to satisfy acceptance criteria within prescribed times, the customer may be entitled to liquidated damages or to cancel its contract and receive a refund of all or a portion of amounts paid or other amounts as damages, which could exceed related contract revenue and which could result in a future charge to earnings. Any failure or delay in achieving final acceptance of our software and services could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe success of our business depends on continued growth in the wireless services industry and growth in demand for connected devices and mobile advertising.\nThe future success of our business depends upon continued new subscriber growth and growth in demand for connected devices. If there is a slowdown in subscriber growth in the wireless services industry or the demand for connected devices were to stabilize or decline, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are a relatively small company with a limited number of products and staff. Sales fluctuations and employee turnover may adversely affect our business.\nWe are a relatively small company. Consequently, compared to larger companies, sales fluctuations could have a greater impact on our revenue and profitability on a quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis and a delayed contract could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year-to-year. In addition, as a small company we have limited staff and are heavily reliant on certain key personnel to operate our business. If a key employee were to leave the company it could have a material impact on our business and results of operations as we might not have sufficient depth in our staffing to fill the role that was previously being performed. A delay in filling the vacated position could put a strain on existing personnel or result in a failure to satisfy our contractual obligations or to effectively implement our internal controls, and materially harm our business.\nBecause our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate, the market price for our stock may be volatile.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. These quarterly and annual fluctuations may result from a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the size of new contracts and when we are able to recognize the related revenue;\n\u00b7 our rate of progress under our contracts;\n\u00b7 foreign exchange fluctuations;\n\u00b7 budgeting cycles of our customers;\n\u00b7 changes in the terms and rates related to the renewal of support agreements;\n\u00b7 the mix of products and services sold;\n\u00b7 the timing of third-party contractors\u2019 delivery of software and hardware;\n\u00b7 level and timing of expenses for product development and sales, general and administrative expenses;\n\u00b7 changes in our strategy;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions.\nAs a result, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful nor do they indicate what our future performance will be. Furthermore, we base our operating expenses and capital investment budgets on expected sales and revenue and many of our expenses, such as lease expenses and personnel costs, are relatively fixed in the short term. Variations in the rate and timing of conversion of our sales prospects into actual revenue could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenue. Any significant shortfall from anticipated levels of demand for our products and services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the market price of our common stock.\nThe market for our service activation products is mature and the markets for our DSA and RLM products are evolving. The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological change and if we do not adapt to rapid technological change, we could lose customers or market share.\nThe market for our service activation product is mature. Customer demand for our DSA and RLM products and enhancements to these products are evolving. Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in carrier requirements and preferences and frequent new service offerings. The introduction of products that incorporate new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can make existing products obsolete and unmarketable. To compete successfully, we must continue to design, develop and sell enhancements to existing products and new products that provide higher levels of performance and reliability in a timely manner, take advantage of technological advancements and changes in industry standards and respond to new customer requirements. Developing new technologies is complex and time-consuming. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur cloud strategy, or Software as a Service (SaaS), and our managed services offerings may not be successful.\nWe offer some of our products as a SaaS implementation or a managed service and we intend to offer more of our solutions in this manner in the future. Our cloud and managed services strategies will continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain profitability. Whether we are successful in providing our solutions as cloud solutions or as managed services depends on our execution in a number of areas, which may or may not be within our control, including continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloud-based and managed services offerings, continued growth and demand for cloud-based and managed services offerings and ensuring that our services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data. Our cloud and managed services strategies also may fail to achieve success if other companies offering cloud-based and managed services experience data loss, security breaches or service reliability issues that cause consumers to become less willing to accept cloud-based and managed services in general.\nIf we are unable to properly supervise our software development staff in India, or if political or other uncertainties interfere, we may be unable to satisfactorily perform our customer contracts.\nIn 2004, we formed Evolving Systems India, a wholly owned subsidiary of Evolving Systems, Inc. and as a result of our 2015 acquisition of SSM, we acquired two additional Indian subsidiaries. We have experienced a high level of turnover with our Indian development staff as a result of strong competition for technology-based personnel in India. In addition, salary levels in India are steadily increasing, reducing the competitive advantages associated with offshore labor. If we are unable to effectively manage the Evolving Systems India development staff and/or we continue to experience high levels of staff turnover, we may fail to provide quality software in a timely fashion, which could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our customer contracts. Furthermore, political changes and uncertainties in India could negatively impact the business climate there. As a result, we may be unable to satisfactorily perform our customer contracts and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nChanges or challenges to the regulations of the communication industry could hurt the market for our products and services.\nOur customers may require, or we may find it necessary or advisable, to modify our products or services to address actual or anticipated changes in regulations affecting our customers. This could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements of foreign jurisdictions. Any compliance failures or changes in such regulations could, likewise, materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nConsolidation in the communications industry may impact our financial performance.\nThe global communications industry has experienced and continues to experience significant consolidation. These consolidations have caused us to lose customers and may result in fewer potential customers requiring our solutions in the future. In addition, combining companies may re-evaluate their solutions and their capital expenditures and may choose a competitive solution used by one of the combining companies. As our customers become larger, they generally have stronger purchasing power, which can result in reduced prices for our products, lower margins on our products and longer sales cycles. All of these factors can have a negative impact on our financial performance, particularly in any fiscal quarter.\nMany of our products and services are sold on a fixed-price basis. If we incur budget overruns this may reduce our profitability.\nA large portion of our revenue currently is, and historically has been, derived from fixed-price contracts and we expect this will continue. These contracts specify certain obligations and deliverables we must meet regardless of the actual costs we incur. Projects done on a fixed-price basis are subject to budget overruns. On occasion, we have experienced budget overruns, resulting in\nlower than anticipated margins. We may incur similar budget overruns in the future, including overruns that result in losses on these contracts. If we incur budget overruns, our margins may be harmed, thereby affecting our overall profitability.\nPercentage-of-completion accounting used for most of our projects can result in overstated or understated profits or losses.\nThe revenue for most of our contracts is accounted for on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. This method of accounting requires us to calculate revenue and profits to be recognized in each reporting period for each project based on our predictions of future outcomes, including our estimates of the total cost to complete the project, project schedule and completion date, the percentage of the project that is completed and the amounts of any probable unapproved change orders. Our failure to accurately estimate these often subjective factors could result in reduced profits or losses for certain contracts.\nThe communications industry is highly competitive and if our products do not satisfy customer demand for performance or price, our customers could purchase products and services from our competitors.\nOur primary markets are intensely competitive and we face continuous demand for improved product performance, new product features and reduced prices, as well as intense pressure to accelerate the release of new products and product enhancements. Our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies, including some competitors that have substantially greater resources, larger installed customer bases and longer-standing relationships with customers than we do. In addition, some network equipment manufacturers\u2019 next generation solutions address some of the benefits provided by our DSA solution.\nCustomers also may offer competitive products or services in the future since customers who have purchased solutions from us are not precluded from competing with us. Many telecommunications companies have large internal development organizations, which develop software solutions and provide services similar to the products and services we provide.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on numerous factors, including the quality and price competitiveness of our products and services compared to those of our competitors, the emergence of new industry standards and technical innovations and our ability to respond to those changes. Some of these factors are within our control, and others are not. A variety of potential actions by our competitors, including a reduction of product prices or increased marketing and promotion, accelerated introduction of new or enhanced products, or cooperative relationships among competitors and their strategic partners, could negatively impact the sales of our products and we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products. Revenue and operating margins may consequently decline. We may not be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors or to properly identify and address the demands of new markets. This is particularly true in new markets where standards are not yet established. Our failure to adapt to emerging market demands, respond to regulatory and technological changes or compete successfully with existing and new competitors would materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\nOur business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees and the market for skilled workers in our industry is very competitive. We may not be able to retain personnel or to hire additional personnel on a timely basis, if at all. Because of the complexity of our software solutions, a significant time lag exists between the hiring date of technical and sales personnel and the time when they become fully productive. We have at times experienced high employee turnover and difficulty in recruiting and retaining technical personnel. Our failure to retain personnel or to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis could adversely affect our business by impacting our ability to develop new products, to complete our projects and secure new contracts.\nOur products are complex and may have errors that are not detected until deployment. Resolving warranty and product liability claims could be expensive and could negatively affect our reputation and profitability.\nThe provisions of our agreements with our customers are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising out of the use of, or defects in, our products, which vary from customer to customer. It is possible that the nature of the damages is not subject to limitations or that these limitations of liability provisions are not effective. Although we carry errors and omissions insurance, to the extent that any successful product liability claim is not covered by our errors and omissions insurance or exceeds the coverage under our policy, we may be required to pay for a claim. This could be expensive, particularly since our software products may be used in critical business applications. As we may subcontract the development of deliverables under customer contracts, we could also be required to indemnify customers for work performed by our subcontractors. We may be able to recover from a subcontractor the amounts we are required to pay to customers due to the subcontractor\u2019s failure to perform but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. Defending against a product liability claim, regardless of its merits, could be expensive and\nrequire the time and attention of key management personnel, either of which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our business reputation could be harmed by product liability claims, regardless of their merit or the eventual outcome of these claims.\nOur business practices with respect to handling personal information or disclosure of confidential information could give rise to liabilities.\nDuring the course of providing our products and services we may collect names, addresses, telephone numbers, credit card data and other personal identification information, or \u201cPII\u201d. This could give rise to potential risks related to data collection and use as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information become more complex. We strive to limit the amount of PII we collect and/or store and we have implemented steps designed to protect against unauthorized access to such information but because of the inherent risks and complexities involved in protecting this information, particularly if we store such information in a cloud implementation, the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation or improper disclosure of such PII. In addition, third party vendors that we engage to perform services for us may unintentionally release PII or otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Some countries have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in their boundaries and are also imposing monetary fines for privacy violations. This imposes financial costs if we are required to implement special operational processes and store data in jurisdictions not of our choosing. Any failure by us to comply with laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection could result in lost or restricted business, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.\nOur measures to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate.\nOur success and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our proprietary technology. Protecting our global intellectual property rights is difficult. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We have 16 patents in the U.S. on elements of our DSA and mobile broadband enablement products and patents pending in other countries on elements of our DSA and IMC products. In addition, we have registered or filed for registration of certain of our trademarks. Our patent portfolio is relatively small and given the cost of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to patent certain inventions that later become important. There is also the possibility that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate; a third party may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization or may develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not adequately protect our proprietary rights.\nWe may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code. Source code, the detailed program commands for our software programs, is critical to our business. If a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. It may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality.\nIf our intellectual property protection proves inadequate, we may lose our competitive advantage and our future financial results may suffer.\nThird parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights, or that we have not complied with their license requirements and we may incur significant expenses in resolving these claims.\nIt is possible that our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, or that other parties may assert infringement claims against us. Those claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue of their own, and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence. We could incur substantial costs in defending against any infringement claim and we could be required to develop non-infringing technology, obtain licenses, or to cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property. Adverse publicity related to any intellectual property litigation also could harm the sale of our products and damage our competitive position.\nCertain software we develop or use may include so called \u201copen source\u201d software made available under a license which may impose obligations on us in the event we distribute derivative works based on the open source software. Certain licenses impose obligations that could require us to make source code for a derivative work available to the public or license the derivative work under a particular type of open source software license, rather than the license terms we customarily use to protect our software.\nThere is little or no legal precedent for interpreting the terms of certain of these open source licenses, including the terms addressing the extent to which software incorporating open source software may be considered a derivative work subject to these licenses. We believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable open source licenses. However, if the\nowner of any open source software were to successfully establish that we had not complied with the terms of an open source license for a particular product that includes such open source software, we may be forced to release the source code for that derivative work to the public or cease distribution of that work.\nCyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.\nIncreased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks have resulted in an increase in information security risks in recent years. Hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack products and services and gain access to networks and data centers. A substantial portion of our software development and customer support is provided out of our India facility, which may be subject to increased risk of power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks and similar events. If we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. Additionally, these systems contain valuable proprietary and confidential information and may contain personal data of our customers\u2019 subscribers and a security breach could result in disruptions of our internal systems and business applications, impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers, product development delays, harm to our competitive position from the compromise of confidential business information, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, many of our services do not have fully redundant systems or a formal disaster recovery plan, and we may not have adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that occur from a system outage. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of these consequences would adversely affect our revenue and margins.\nDisruptions from terrorist activities, geopolitical conditions or military actions may disrupt our business.\nThe continued threat of terrorism within the U.S. and throughout the world and acts of war may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world. Abrupt political changes and armed conflict pose a risk of economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers. Our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, delays in collecting cash, a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology, or our inability to effectively market, manufacture or ship our products. We are unable to predict whether war, political unrest and the threat of terrorism will result in any long-term commercial disruptions or if such activities will have any long-term material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe face risks associated with doing business through local partners.\nIn some countries, because of local customs and regulations or for language reasons, we do business with our customers through local partners who resell our products and services, with or without value-added services. This can cause delays in closing contracts because of the increased complexity of having another party involved in negotiations. In addition, where the local partner provides additional software, hardware and/or services to the end-user customer, our products and services may only be a small portion of the total solution. As a result, payments made to us, as well as conditions surrounding acceptance, may be impacted by factors that are out of our control. There may also be delays in getting payments made by the end-user customer through the reseller. We have experienced delays in closing contracts through partners and collecting from resellers and this situation may arise again in the future, negatively impacting our cash flows. Doing business through local partners may also increase our risks under anti-bribery regulations, discussed below.\nOur international operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nOur international business operations are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from paying or offering anything of value to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business, or otherwise receiving discretionary favorable treatment of any kind. To the extent we do business through Evolving Systems UK, we are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. In addition, many countries in which we do business have their own anti-bribery rules and regulations. Under these regulations, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local partners and agents, even if such parties act without our knowledge. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or the Bribery Act of 2010 (whether directly or through acts of others, intentionally or through inadvertence) or other anti-bribery legislation could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance, situations outside of our control may arise that could potentially put us in violation of anti-bribery legislation inadvertently and thus negatively impact our business.\nSales of large blocks of our stock may result in the reduction in the market price of our stock and make it more difficult to raise funds in the future.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could fall. The perception among investors that such sales will occur could also produce this effect. We currently have several stockholders who own large percentages of our stock. To the extent we continue to have one or more stockholders who own a large percentage of our stock and those stockholders chose to liquidate their holdings, it may have a dramatic impact on the market price of our stock. These factors also could make it more difficult to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nAs a result of operating as a smaller public company, we may experience challenges in complying with rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities, and our management is required to devote substantial time to comply with new and ongoing regulatory initiatives.\nBecause our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and NASDAQ, have issued requirements and regulations and continue to adopt additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress. Establishment of effective internal controls is further complicated because we are a relatively small company with global operations, and multiple locations and IT systems. Our management and other personnel have, and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, accounting principles or tax rules and regulations, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). It is possible that future requirements could change our current application of U.S. GAAP, resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial positions or results of operation. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We regularly assess our implementation of applicable accounting principles and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, but we are a relatively small company and our business is complex; the final determination of any tax authority, upon examination of our income tax returns, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nCertain provisions of our charter documents, employment arrangements and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of us, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could continue to make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7 our stockholders cannot take action by written consent;\n\u00b7 we have advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7 our stockholders can only remove directors without cause by supermajority vote; and\n\u00b7 our stockholders can only amend our bylaws or certain Board of Directors-related provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation by a supermajority vote.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in the prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 and certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our management, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by discouraging or preventing takeover attempts that might result in the payment of a premium price to our stockholders.\nOur named executive officers have entered into agreements with us that contain a change in control provision. These agreements generally provide for acceleration on vesting of options, 50% upon a change in control (as defined in such agreement) if the executive officer remains employed with the new entity, or 100% in the event the executive officer\u2019s employment is terminated. The acceleration of vesting of options upon a change in control may be viewed as an anti-takeover measure and may have the effect of discouraging a merger proposal, tender offer or other attempt to gain control of us.\nOur Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan provides for acceleration of vesting under certain circumstances. Upon certain changes in control of us, vesting on some options awarded to directors may be accelerated. In addition, the successor corporation may assume outstanding stock awards or substitute equivalent stock awards. If the successor corporation refuses to do so, such stock awards will become fully vested and exercisable for a period of 15 days after notice from us but the options will terminate if not exercised during that period. As noted above, the acceleration on vesting of options upon a change in control may be viewed as an anti-takeover measure.\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.\nUnsettled financial markets, higher interest rates, inflation, levels of unemployment and worsening economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products and services as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to these conditions. Challenging economic and market conditions may also result in:\n\u00b7 difficulty forecasting, budgeting and planning due to limited visibility into the spending plans of current or prospective customers;\n\u00b7 pricing pressure that may adversely affect revenue and gross margin;\n\u00b7 lengthening sales cycles and slowing deployments;\n\u00b7 increased competition for fewer projects and sales opportunities;\n\u00b7 increased risk of charges relating to write off of goodwill and other intangible assets; and\n\u00b7 customer and reseller financial difficulty and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable.\nWe may not continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and cash used to pay dividends will not be available for other corporate purposes\nIn 2015, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.11 per share. The decision to pay dividends in the future will depend on general business conditions, the impact of such payment on our financial condition and other factors our Board of Directors may consider to be relevant. In addition, our revolving credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends by establishing a maximum amount that can be paid per quarter and prohibiting payment of dividends when an event of default has occurred. If we elect to pay future dividends, this could reduce our cash reserves to levels that may be inadequate to fund expansions to our business plan or unanticipated contingent liabilities.\nOur stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.\nAll of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 86062, "SIC": 7371, "TIC": "EVOL"}
