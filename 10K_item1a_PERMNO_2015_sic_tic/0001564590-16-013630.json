The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. If any of those risks actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page one of this document.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nGeneral trends in the television industry could adversely affect demand for television advertising as consumers migrate to alternative media, including the Internet, for entertainment.\nTelevision viewing among consumers has been negatively impacted by the increasing availability of alternative media, including the Internet. As a result, in recent years demand for television advertising has been declining and demand for advertising in alternative media has been increasing, and we expect this trend to continue.\nThe networks may stream their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms simultaneously with, or in close proximity to, network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own or provide services to. These and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and may adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations.\nThe Company\u2019s substantial debt could limit its ability to grow and compete.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had $1.5 billion of debt, which represented 94.8% of the total combined capitalization. In January and February 2016, we borrowed a net amount of $54.0 million under our revolving credit facility to finance certain acquisitions (see Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Recent Acquisitions\u201d). The Company\u2019s high level of debt could have important consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u25cf\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds or obtain additional financing in the future;\n\u25cf\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue acquisition opportunities;\n\u25cf\nexpose the Company to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities is variable;\n\u25cf\nlimit the Company\u2019s flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u25cf\nimpair our ability to withstand a general downturn in our business and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.\nSee Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations\u201d for disclosure of the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature.\nThe Company could also incur additional debt in the future. The terms of the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facilities, as well as the indentures governing our 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes (\u201c6.875% Notes\u201d) and 6.125% Notes, limit, but do not prohibit the Company from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt. To the extent the Company incurs additional debt we would become even more susceptible to the leverage-related risks described above.\nThe agreements governing the Company\u2019s debt contain various covenants that limit management\u2019s discretion in the operation of our business.\nThe terms of the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our 6.875% Notes and our 6.125% Notes contain various restrictive covenants customary for arrangements of these types that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur additional debt and issue preferred stock;\n\u25cf\npay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u25cf\nmake investments and other restricted payments;\n\u25cf\nmake acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nmerge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u25cf\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u25cf\ncreate liens;\n\u25cf\nsell assets or stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u25cf\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios, including maximum total and first-lien leverage ratios and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Future financing agreements may contain similar, or even more restrictive, provisions and covenants. As a result of these restrictions and covenants, management\u2019s ability to operate our business at its discretion is limited, and we may be unable to compete effectively, pursue acquisitions or take advantage of new business opportunities, any of which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in present or future financing agreements, a default may occur. A default could allow creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. A default could also allow creditors to foreclose on any collateral securing such debt.\nThe credit agreement governing our obligations under our senior secured credit facility contains covenants that require us to comply with certain financial ratios, including maximum total and first-lien ratios and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The covenants, which are calculated on a quarterly basis, include the combined results of the Company. The credit agreements governing Mission\u2019s and Marshall\u2019s obligations under their senior secured credit facilities do not contain financial covenant ratio requirements; however, they include events of default if we do not comply with all covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility.\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service requirements.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to service its debt depends on its ability to generate the necessary cash flow. Generation of the necessary cash flow is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company cannot assure you that its business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to the Company under its current or any replacement credit facilities, or that it will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to fund its operations or pay its debts and other obligations, or to fund its liquidity needs. If the Company is not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt obligations, it may need to refinance or restructure its debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to meet its debt service obligations, its lenders may determine to stop making loans to the Company, and/or the Company\u2019s lenders or other holders of its debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe owners of the VIEs may make decisions regarding the operation of their respective stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements.\nThe VIEs are each 100% owned by independent third parties. As of December 31, 2015, these entities own and operate 30 full power television stations. We have entered into local service agreements with these VIEs, pursuant to which we provide services to their respective stations. In return for the services we provide, we receive substantially all of their available cash, after satisfaction of their operating costs and any debt obligations.\nOn December 3, 2012, Mission entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, UBS Securities LLC, as syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book manager, RBC Capital Markets, as documentation agent, joint lead arranger and joint book manager, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as joint lead arranger and joint book manager, and a syndicate of other lenders, which provides for a first-lien credit facility (the \u201cMission Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2015, the Mission Facility consisted of a term loan with an outstanding balance of approximately $225.6 million maturing on October 1, 2020 and a maximum revolving credit facility of $8.0 million maturing on December 3, 2017.\nOn December 1, 2014, Marshall entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent and L/C issuer (the \u201cMarshall Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2015, the Marshall Facility consisted of a term loan with an outstanding balance of $55.5 million maturing on June 28, 2018 and an outstanding loan under its revolving credit facility of $2.0 million maturing on December 3, 2017.\nWe guarantee all of the obligations incurred under the Mission Facility and the Marshall Facility.\nMission has granted to us purchase options to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of Mission\u2019s stations, subject to FCC consent, for consideration equal to the greater of (i) seven times the station\u2019s cash flow, as defined in each option agreement, less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in each option agreement or (ii) the amount of its indebtedness. Additionally, Mission\u2019s shareholders have granted Nexstar an option to purchase any or all of Mission\u2019s stock, subject to FCC consent, for a price equal to the pro rata portion of the greater of (i) five times the stations\u2019 cash flow, as defined in each option agreement, reduced by the amount of indebtedness, as defined in each option agreement, or (ii) $100,000.\nWhite Knight has granted us purchase options to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of Mission\u2019s stations, subject to FCC consent, for consideration equal to the greater of (i) an amount equal to six (6) times the annual Net Income (as defined in the option) and (ii) $100,000.\nWe do not own the VIEs or any of their respective television stations. However, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in the consolidated VIEs because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the VIEs\u2019 stations, (2) Nexstar\u2019s guarantee of the obligations incurred under the Mission Facility and the Marshall Facility, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the VIEs\u2019 economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising sales and, for Mission, White Knight and Parker, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by Mission and White Knight which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of Mission\u2019s or White Knight\u2019s stations, subject to FCC consent.\nIn compliance with FCC regulations, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances and personnel for their respective stations. As a result, the VIEs\u2019 boards of directors and officers can make decisions with which we disagree and which could reduce the cash flow generated by these stations and, as a consequence, the amounts we receive under our local service agreements with the VIEs. For instance, the VIEs may decide to obtain and broadcast programming which, in our opinion, would prove unpopular and/or would generate less advertising revenue.\nThe recording of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future or the impact of tax law changes on such deferred tax assets could affect our operating results.\nThe Company currently has significant net deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards, net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. Based on our assessment of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets, we determined that as of December 31, 2015, based on projected future income, approximately $93.2 million of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized in the future, and no valuation allowance is currently required for these deferred tax assets. Should we determine in the future that these assets will not be realized, the Company will be required to record a valuation allowance in connection with these deferred tax assets and the Company\u2019s operating results would be adversely affected in the period such determination is made. In addition, tax law changes could negatively impact the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use net operating loss carry-forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to reduce future tax payments may be limited if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels or there is a change in ownership of Nexstar, Mission, Marshall or White Knight.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had NOLs of approximately $222.0 million for U.S. federal tax purposes and $105.8 million for state tax purposes. These NOLs expire at varying dates from 2018 through 2033. To the extent available, we intend to use these NOLs to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups, which are generally outside of our control.\nIn May 2013, our former principal stockholder, ABRY Partners, LLC (\u201cABRY\u201d), sold the remainder of its common stock holdings in Nexstar and no longer holds an ownership interest in us. As a result of this sale, an ownership change has occurred resulting in a Section 382 limitation on the use of Nexstar\u2019s NOLs. Additionally, any subsequent ownership changes in us, Mission, Marshall, or White Knight could result in additional limitations.\nThe ability to use NOLs is also dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to generate taxable income. The NOLs could expire before the Company generates sufficient taxable income to use them. To the extent the Company\u2019s use of NOLs is significantly limited, the Company\u2019s income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if it were able to use NOLs, which could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and operations. Changes in ownership are largely beyond the Company\u2019s control and the Company can give no assurance that it will continue to have realizable NOLs.\nThe revenue generated by stations we operate or provide services to could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network affiliation agreements on favorable terms, or at all.\nDue to the quality of the programming provided by the networks, stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market. As a result, it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations. Most of the stations that we operate or provide services to have network affiliation agreements. As of December 31, 2015, 20 full power television stations have primary affiliation agreements with ABC, 20 with NBC, 26 with FOX, 20 with CBS, eight with The CW and five with MyNetworkTV. Each of ABC, NBC and CBS generally provides affiliated stations with up to 22 hours of prime time programming per week, while each of FOX, MyNetworkTV and The CW provides affiliated stations with up to 15 hours of prime time programming per week. In return, affiliated stations broadcast the respective network\u2019s commercials during the network programming.\nAll of the network affiliation agreements of the stations that we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to are scheduled to expire at various times through June 2020. In order to renew certain of our affiliation agreements we may be required to make cash payments to the network and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements. If any of our stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with their networks for any reason, we would need to find alternative sources of programming, which may be less attractive to our audiences and more expensive to obtain. In addition, a loss of a specific network affiliation for a station may affect our retransmission consent payments resulting in us receiving less retransmission consent fees. Further, some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances.\nFor more information regarding these network affiliation agreements, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Network Affiliations.\u201d\nThe loss of or material reduction in retransmission consent revenues or further regulatory change in the current retransmission consent regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNexstar\u2019s retransmission consent agreements with cable operators, DBS systems, and other MVPDs permit the MVPDs to retransmit our stations\u2019 signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us from the system operators as consideration. If we are unable to renegotiate these agreements on favorable terms, or at all, the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe television networks have taken the position that they, as the owners or licensees of programming we broadcast and provide for retransmission, are entitled to a portion of the compensation we receive under the retransmission consent agreements and are including provisions for these payments to them in their network affiliation agreements. In addition, our affiliation agreements with some broadcast networks include terms that affect our ability to grant MVPDs the right to retransmit network programming, and in some cases, we may lose the right to grant retransmission consent to such providers. Inclusion of these or similar provisions in our network affiliation agreements could materially reduce this revenue source to the Company and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, MVPDs are actively seeking to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (1) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (2) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (3) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations during a retransmission consent dispute.\nOn March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing \u201cgood faith\u201d retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. Under the new rule, top-four stations may not (1) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned top-four station located in the same DMA or to a third party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned top-four television station in the same DMA; or (2) facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information.\nThis new rule took effect on June 18, 2014. On December 5, 2014, the U.S. Congress extended the joint negotiation prohibition to all non-commonly owned television stations in a market. Retransmission consent agreements jointly negotiated prior to June 18, 2014 remain enforceable until the end of their current terms; however, contractual provisions between separately owned top-four stations to consult or jointly negotiate retransmission agreements are now effectively void. Accordingly, the VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their respective retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs. We cannot predict what effect, if any, this requirement for separate negotiations will have on the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses.\nConcurrently with its adoption of the prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations, the FCC also adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking which seeks additional comment on the elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. The FCC\u2019s prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations and its possible elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules may affect the Company\u2019s ability to sustain its current level of retransmission consent revenues or grow such revenues in the future and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the resolution of the FCC\u2019s network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity proposals, or the impact of these proposals or the FCC\u2019s new prohibition on certain joint negotiations, on its business.\nIn addition, in the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014, which was adopted and signed into law in December 2014, the U.S. Congress directed the FCC to commence a rulemaking to \u201creview its totality of the circumstances test for good faith [retransmission consent] negotiations.\u201d The FCC commenced this proceeding in September 2015, and comments and reply comments were filed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We cannot predict the proceeding\u2019s outcome or its impact on our business.\nFurther, certain online video distributors and OTTDs have begun streaming broadcast programming over the Internet. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an OTTD\u2019s transmissions of television broadcast signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate copyright holders\u2019 exclusive right to perform their works publicly as provided under the Copyright Act. In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term \u201cMVPD\u201d to encompass OTTDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time, and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OTTDs. Comments and reply comments were filed in the first and second quarters of 2015 and we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding. However, if the FCC ultimately determines that an OTTD is not an MVPD, or declines to apply certain rules governing MVPDs to OTTDs, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe FCC could decide not to grant renewal of the FCC license of any of the stations we operate or provide services to which would require that station to cease operations.\nTelevision broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if, during the preceding term, the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC\u2019s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC\u2019s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period. However, in an extreme case, the FCC may deny a station\u2019s license renewal application, resulting in termination of the station\u2019s authority to broadcast. Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC\u2019s processing of a timely renewal application.\nThe Company filed renewal applications for its stations in the most recent license renewal cycle, the majority of which have been granted for an additional eight-year term. Some of the Company\u2019s renewal applications remain pending with the FCC. The Company expects the FCC to grant these renewals in due course but cannot provide any assurances that the FCC will do so. The time period in which third parties are permitted to submit objections to these applications has expired; however, such parties may continue to submit informal objections until an application is granted.\nThe loss of the services of our chief executive officer could disrupt management of our business and impair the execution of our business strategies.\nWe believe that our success depends upon our ability to retain the services of Perry A. Sook, our founder and President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Sook has been instrumental in determining our strategic direction and focus. The loss of Mr. Sook\u2019s services could adversely affect our ability to manage effectively our overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies.\nThe Company\u2019s growth may be limited if it is unable to implement its acquisition strategy.\nThe Company has achieved much of its growth through acquisitions. The Company intends to continue its growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions of television stations. The television broadcast industry is undergoing consolidation, which may reduce the number of acquisition targets and increase the purchase price of future acquisitions. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors may have greater financial or management resources with which to pursue acquisition targets. Therefore, even if the Company is successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets, it may face considerable competition and its acquisition strategy may not be successful.\nFCC rules and policies may also make it more difficult for the Company to acquire additional television stations. Television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the FCC and, potentially, other regulatory authorities. FCC rules limit the number of television stations a company may own and define the types of local service agreements that \u201ccount\u201d as ownership by the party providing the services. Those rules are subject to change; for instance, rules and processing policies that the FCC adopted in 2014 with respect to local service agreements impacted certain of our and Mission\u2019s previously announced acquisitions. The need for FCC and other regulatory approvals could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to consummate future transactions, including the acquisition of Media General, if, for example, the FCC or other government agencies believe that a proposed transaction would result in excessive concentration or other public interest detriment in a market, even if the proposed combination may otherwise comply with FCC ownership limitations. Additionally, the acquisition of Media General will significantly increase the Company\u2019s national audience reach to a level that approaches national television ownership limits imposed by the Communications Act and FCC rules. This may restrict future television station acquisitions by the Company and may require the Company to divest current stations in connection with any acquisition in order to comply with national television ownership limits.\nGrowing the Company\u2019s business through acquisitions involves risks and if it is unable to manage effectively its growth, its operating results will suffer.\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired 35 full power television stations. In February 2016, we completed the acquisition of four full power television stations, and we currently have various signed agreements to acquire an additional five full power television stations. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Media General\u2019s outstanding equity for cash and stock consideration, plus potential additional consideration in the form of a CVR entitling Media General shareholders to net cash proceeds from the sale of Media General\u2019s spectrum in the FCC\u2019s upcoming spectrum auction. Media General currently owns, operates or provides services to 71 television stations in 48 markets. To manage effectively its growth and address the increased reporting requirements and administrative demands that will result from future acquisitions, the Company will need, among other things, to continue to develop its financial and management controls and management information systems. The Company will also need to continue to identify, attract and retain highly skilled finance and management personnel. Failure to do any of these tasks in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm its business.\nThere are other risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions. For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to successfully reduce costs, increase advertising revenue or audience share or realize anticipated synergies and economies of scale with respect to any acquired station;\n\u25cf\nan acquisition may increase our leverage and debt service requirements or may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities;\n\u25cf\nour management may be reassigned from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate the acquired business;\n\u25cf\nwe may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems, as well as company policies and cultures;\n\u25cf\nwe may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business; and\n\u25cf\nproblems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition.\nFCC actions have restricted our ability to create duopolies under local service agreements, which may harm our existing operations and impair our acquisition strategy.\nIn a number of our markets, we have created duopolies by entering into what we refer to as local service agreements. While these agreements take varying forms, a typical local service agreement is an agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market, whereby the owner of one station provides operational assistance to the other station, subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter station\u2019s owner. By operating or entering into local service agreements with same-market stations, we (and the other station) achieve significant operational efficiencies. We also broaden our audience reach and enhance our ability to capture more advertising spending in a given market.\nThe FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years and eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the \u201cpublic interest, convenience and necessity.\u201d In March 2014, the FCC initiated its 2014 quadrennial review with the adoption of a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cFNPRM\u201d). The FNPRM solicits comment on proposed changes to the media ownership rules. Among the proposals in the FNPRM are (1) retention of the current local television ownership rule (but with modifications to certain service contour definitions to conform to digital television broadcasting), (2) elimination of the radio/television cross-ownership rule, (3) elimination of the newspaper/radio cross-ownership rule, and (4) retention of the newspaper/television cross-ownership rule, while considering waivers of that rule in certain circumstances. The FNPRM also proposes to define a category of sharing agreements designated as SSAs between television stations, and to require television stations to disclose those SSAs. Comments and reply comments on the FNPRM were filed in 2014.\nConcurrent with its adoption of the FNPRM, the FCC adopted a rule making television JSAs attributable ownership interests to the seller of advertising time in certain circumstances. Under this rule, where a party owns a full-power television station in a market and sells more than 15% of the weekly advertising time for another, non-owned station in the same market under a JSA, that party is deemed to have an attributable ownership interest in the latter station for purposes of the local television ownership rule. Parties to existing JSAs that do not comply with the newly adopted rule were given two years from the effective date of this new rule to modify or terminate their JSAs to come into compliance. Subsequent federal legislation in late 2014 extended this compliance period for an additional six months. Most recently, appropriations legislation adopted by Congress and signed into law in late December 2015 extended the JSA compliance deadline until September 30, 2025. In addition, the FCC required our JSAs for the independently owned Marshall stations to cover 15% or less of the weekly advertising inventory of those stations and approved Marshall\u2019s station acquisitions specifically in reliance on certain commitments regarding our relationship with Marshall, including a commitment that the term of the Marshall debt financing that we guarantee will not extend beyond five years from Marshall\u2019s acquisition of its stations. Our SSAs with Mission, Marshall and other parties remain permissible for now, but the FNPRM leaves open the possibility of additional regulation with respect to SSAs.\nVarious parties, including Nexstar (and Mission, which has intervened), have appealed the television JSA attribution rule to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That appeal was transferred to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in November 2015, and oral argument is scheduled for April 19, 2016. If we are required to terminate or modify our JSAs or other local service agreements, our business could be affected in the following ways: (1) Loss of revenues - we could lose some or all of the revenues generated from those arrangements due to the reduction in audience reach to our advertisers and receipt of less revenues from them. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company\u2019s net revenue included $78.6 million and $68.5 million, respectively, of revenue recognized by Mission, which is comprised of its revenue from local service agreements with Nexstar and revenue from other sources. See the notes to the Company\u2019s and Mission\u2019s financial statements for further information; (2) Increased costs - our cost structure would increase due to loss of operating synergies associated with the addition of redundant management and overlapping sales force costs and (3) Alternative arrangements - we may need to enter into alternative agreements which may be on terms that are less beneficial to us than existing agreements.\nAlso in March 2014, the FCC\u2019s Media Bureau issued a public notice announcing \u201cprocessing guidelines\u201d for certain pending and future applications for FCC approval of television acquisitions. The public notice indicates that the FCC will \u201cclosely scrutinize\u201d applications which propose a JSA, SSA or local marketing agreement between television stations, combined with an option, a similar \u201ccontingent interest,\u201d or a loan guarantee. These processing guidelines have impacted the Company\u2019s previously announced acquisitions and may affect the Company\u2019s acquisition of additional stations in the future. We cannot predict what additional rules the FCC will adopt or when they will be adopted. In addition, uncertainty about media ownership regulations and adverse economic conditions have dampened the acquisition market from time to time, and changes in the regulatory approval process may make materially more expensive, or may materially delay, the Company\u2019s ability to close upon currently pending acquisitions or consummate further acquisitions in the future.\nThe FCC may decide to terminate \u201cgrandfathered\u201d time brokerage agreements.\nThe FCC attributes TBAs and local marketing agreements to the programmer under its ownership limits if the programmer provides more than 15% of a station\u2019s weekly broadcast programming. However, TBAs entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt from attribution for now.\nThe FCC will review these \u201cgrandfathered\u201d TBAs in the future. During this review, the FCC may determine to terminate the \u201cgrandfathered\u201d period and make all TBAs fully attributable to the programmer. If the FCC does so, we and Mission will be required to terminate the TBAs for stations WFXP and KHMT and we and Parker will be required to terminate the TBA for station KFQX unless the FCC simultaneously changes its duopoly rules to allow ownership of two stations in the applicable markets.\nWe are subject to foreign ownership limitations which limits foreign investments in us.\nThe Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act prohibits more than 25% indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by such restriction, and the FCC has interpreted this provision to require an affirmative public interest showing before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25%. Therefore, certain investors may be prevented from investing in us if our foreign ownership is at or near the FCC limits.\nThe FCC\u2019s multiple ownership rules may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets, restricting our ability to execute our acquisition strategy.\nThe number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by FCC rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable under FCC rules. The broadcast and certain other media interests of our officers, directors and most stockholders with 5% or greater voting power are attributable under the FCC\u2019s rules, which may limit us from acquiring or owning television stations in particular markets while those officers, directors or stockholders are associated with us. In addition, the holder of otherwise non-attributable equity and/or debt in a licensee in excess of 33% of the total debt and equity of the licensee will be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station or daily newspaper in the same market.\nTwo of Nexstar\u2019s directors also currently serve on the board of directors of Radio One, Inc., which owns and operates approximately 58 radio stations in 17 markets. The FCC considers the radio stations owned by Radio One, Inc. as attributable to Nexstar, due to this common director relationship. Therefore, depending on the number of stations owned by Radio One, Inc. in a given market, we may not be able to purchase a television station in that market. In addition, one of Nexstar\u2019s stockholders who holds an attributable interest in Nexstar also holds an attributable interest in other full power television stations located in the Seattle-Tacoma, Washington, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, California, Providence, RI-New Bedford, Massachusetts and Palm Springs, California television markets. Therefore, Nexstar may be unable to acquire stations in these markets.\nThe Company has a material amount of goodwill and intangible assets, and therefore the Company could suffer losses due to future asset impairment charges.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $1.3 billion, or 68.4%, of the Company\u2019s combined total assets consisted of goodwill and intangible assets, including FCC licenses and network affiliation agreements. The Company tests goodwill and FCC licenses annually, and on an interim date if factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test of these assets, in accordance with accounting and disclosure requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company tests network affiliation agreements whenever circumstances or indicators become apparent the asset may not be recoverable through expected future cash flows. The methods used to evaluate the impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets would be affected by a significant reduction in operating results or cash flows at one or more of the Company\u2019s television stations, or a forecast of such reductions, a significant adverse change in the advertising marketplaces in which the Company\u2019s television stations operate, the loss of network affiliations, or by adverse changes to FCC ownership rules, among others, which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets is revised downward due to impairment, such non-cash charge could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurances concerning continuing dividend payments and any decrease or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur common stockholders are only entitled to receive the dividends declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors has declared in 2016 a total cash dividend with respect to the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock of $0.96 per share in equal quarterly installments of $0.24 per share. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy. However, future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and can be changed or discontinued at any time. Dividend determinations (including the amount of the cash dividend, the record date and date of payment) will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, targeted future acquisitions, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes limit our ability to pay dividends. Given these considerations, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur operating results are dependent on advertising revenue and as a result, we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond our control than businesses not dependent on advertising.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising time on our stations and community portal websites. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on numerous factors that may be beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf\nthe health of the economy in the local markets where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u25cf\nthe popularity of our station and website programming;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in pricing for local and national advertising;\n\u25cf\nthe activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based media, particularly newspapers, cable television, Internet and radio;\n\u25cf\nthe decreased demand for political advertising in non-election years; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located.\nBecause businesses generally reduce their advertising budgets during economic recessions or downturns, the reliance upon advertising revenue makes our operating results susceptible to prevailing economic conditions. Our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership, and we may not achieve favorable ratings. Our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. A shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity, which could cause our advertising revenue to decline. In addition, we and the programming providers upon which we rely may not be able to anticipate, and effectively react to, shifts in viewer tastes and interests in our markets.\nBecause a high percentage of our operating expense is fixed, a relatively small decrease in advertising revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.\nOur business is characterized generally by high fixed costs, primarily for debt service, broadcast rights and personnel. Other than commissions paid to our sales staff and outside sales agencies, our expenses do not vary significantly with the increase or decrease in advertising revenue. As a result, a relatively small change in advertising prices could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results. Accordingly, a minor shortfall in expected revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.\nPreemption of regularly scheduled programming by news coverage may affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe Company may experience a loss of advertising revenue and incur additional broadcasting expenses due to preemption of our regularly scheduled programming by network coverage of a major global news event such as a war or terrorist attack or by local coverage of local disasters, such as tornados and hurricanes. As a result, advertising may not be aired and the revenue for such advertising may be lost unless the station is able to run the advertising at agreed-upon times in the future. Advertisers may not agree to run such advertising in future time periods, and space may not be available for such advertising. The duration of any preemption of programming cannot be predicted if it occurs. In addition, our stations and the stations we provide services to may incur additional expenses as a result of expanded news coverage of a war or terrorist attack or local disaster. The loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry trends, our television businesses may not be able to compete effectively.\nNew technologies may adversely affect our television stations. Information delivery and programming alternatives such as cable, direct satellite-to-home services, pay-per-view, video on demand, over-the-top distribution of programming, the Internet, telephone company services, mobile devices, digital video recorders and home video and entertainment systems have fractionalized television viewing audiences and expanded the numbers and types of distribution channels for advertisers to access. Over the past decade, cable television programming services, other emerging video distribution platforms and the Internet have captured an increasing market share, while the aggregate viewership of the major television networks has declined. In addition, the expansion of cable and satellite television, the digital and other technological changes has increased, and may continue to increase, the competitive demand for programming. Such increased demand, together with rising production costs, may increase our programming costs or impair our ability to acquire or develop desired programming.\nIn addition, video compression techniques now in use with MVPDs are expected to permit greater numbers of channels to be carried within existing bandwidth. These compression techniques and other technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to targeted audiences. Reduction in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized niche programming, resulting in more audience fractionalization. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences may alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. We are unable to predict the effect that these and other technological changes will have on the television industry or our results of operations.\nThe FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations which it finds to be indecent.\nThe FCC may impose substantial fines, to a maximum of $325,000 per violation, on television broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent material in violation of the Communications Act and its rules. Because the Company\u2019s programming is in large part comprised of programming provided by the networks with which the stations are affiliated, the Company does not have full control over what is broadcast on its stations and may be subject to the imposition of fines if the FCC finds such programming to be indecent.\nIn June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC\u2019s indecency enforcement without resolving the constitutionality of such enforcement, and the FCC thereafter requested public comment on the appropriate substance and scope of its indecency enforcement policy. The FCC has issued very few further decisions or rules in this area, and the courts may in the future have further occasion to review the FCC\u2019s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIntense competition in the television industry could limit our growth and profitability.\nAs a television broadcasting company, we face a significant level of competition, both directly and indirectly. Generally we compete for our audience against all the other leisure activities in which one could choose to engage rather than watch television. Specifically, stations we own or provide services to compete for audience share, programming and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and with other advertising media, including newspapers, radio stations, cable television, DBS systems and the Internet.\nThe entertainment and television industries are highly competitive and are undergoing a period of consolidation. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, programming and broadcasting resources than we do. The markets in which we operate are also in a constant state of change arising from, among other things, technological improvements and economic and regulatory developments. Technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment, such as cable television, wireless cable, satellite-to-home distribution services, pay-per-view, home video and entertainment systems and Internet and mobile distribution of video programming have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over-the-air television broadcast stations to increased competition. We may not be able to compete effectively or adjust our business plans to meet changing market conditions. We are unable to predict what forms of competition will develop in the future, the extent of the competition or its possible effects on our business.\nThe FCC could implement regulations or the U.S. Congress could adopt legislation that might have a significant impact on the operations of the stations we own and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcasting industry as a whole.\nThe FCC has open proceedings to examine shared services agreements between television stations; to determine whether to standardize TV stations\u2019 reporting of programming responsive to local needs and interests; to determine whether to modify or eliminate certain of its broadcast ownership rules, including the radio-television cross-ownership rule and the newspaper-television cross-ownership rule; whether to modify its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules; whether to modify its standards for \u201cgood faith\u201d retransmission consent negotiations; and whether to broaden the definition of \u201cMVPD\u201d to include \u201cover-the-top\u201d video programming distributors.\nThe FCC also has sought comment on whether there are alternatives to the use of DMAs to define local markets such that certain viewers whose current DMAs straddle multiple states would be provided with more in-state broadcast programming. If the FCC determines to modify the use of existing DMAs to determine a station\u2019s local market, such change might materially alter current station operations and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FCC also may decide to initiate other new rule making proceedings on its own or in response to requests from outside parties, any of which might have such an impact. The U.S. Congress may also act to amend the Communications Act in a manner that could impact our stations and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcast industry in general.\nThe FCC intends to reallocate some portion of the spectrum available for use by television broadcasters to wireless broadband use, which could substantially impact our future operations and may reduce viewer access to our programming.\nThe FCC is seeking to make additional spectrum available to meet future wireless broadband needs. In February 2012, the U.S. Congress adopted legislation authorizing the FCC to conduct an incentive auction whereby television broadcasters could voluntarily relinquish all or part of their spectrum in exchange for consideration. The FCC has released various orders and public notices which set forth procedures that the FCC will follow in the incentive auction and the subsequent \u201crepacking\u201d of broadcast television spectrum, establish opening prices for television stations to relinquish their spectrum, and resolve various technical and other issues related to the incentive auction, the possible sharing of channels by television stations, and the repurposing of television spectrum for broadband use. The FCC has announced March 29, 2016 as the commencement date for the incentive auction. January 12, 2016 was the deadline for potentially interested television licensees to file applications to participate in the incentive auction, and we and certain of our local service agreement partners filed such applications. The reallocation of television spectrum for wireless broadband use will require many television stations to change channel or otherwise modify their technical facilities. The reallocation of television spectrum to broadband use may be to the detriment of our investment in digital facilities, could require substantial additional investment to continue our current operations, and may require viewers to invest in additional equipment or subscription services to continue receiving broadcast television signals. We cannot predict the results of television spectrum reallocation efforts or its impact to our business.\nWe have made investments in digital media businesses.\nWe have invested in various digital media businesses as well as digital offerings for each of our broadcast stations. Due to the intense competition, limited operating history and rapidly evolving nature of these digital media businesses, the actual future operating results could be volatile and negatively impact the year-to-year trends of our operations.\nCybersecurity risks could affect the Company\u2019s operating effectiveness.\nThe Company uses computers in substantially all aspects of its business operations. Its revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes the Company to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.", "PERMNO": 89916, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "NXST"}
