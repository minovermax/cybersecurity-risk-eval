{"cik": "1721741", "company": "Lazydays Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are material risks to which our business operations are subject. Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These risks could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements contained herein and elsewhere. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or those we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.\nRisks Related to Lazydays Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could have in the future, certain negative impacts on our business, and such impacts may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The long term effects of COVID-19 could result in a net negative impact on our business.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and globally. Beginning in mid-to-late March of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to severe disruptions in general economic activity as businesses and federal, state, and local governments took increasingly broad actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on public health, including through \u201cshelter in place\u201d or \u201cstay at home\u201d orders in states in which we operate. As we modified our business practices to conform to government guidelines and best practices to ensure the health and safety of our customers, employees and the communities we serve, we saw significant early declines in revenue across all lines of business.\nIn response to the steep decline in demand, the Company enacted cost saving measures, including the reduction of our workforce by approximately 25% and senior management agreeing to temporarily forgo 25% of their salary. To further protect our liquidity and cash position, our lenders provided for the temporary suspension of scheduled principal and interest payments on our term and mortgage loans from April 15, 2020 through June 15, 2020 and for the temporary suspension of scheduled floorplan curtailment payments from April 1, 2020 through June 15, 2020. We also received $8.7 million in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program.\nStarting in May 2020, we experienced a significant improvement in sales of new and pre-owned vehicles. This improvement likely relates, at least in part, to an increase in consumer demand as consumers seek outdoor travel and leisure activities that permit appropriate social distancing. However, we can provide no assurances that such growth in sales will continue at the same rate as between May and December 2020, or at all, over any time period, and sales may ultimately decline. Furthermore, our improved sales and cost savings measures to date may not be sufficient to offset any later adverse impacts of the pandemic, and our liquidity could be negatively impacted, if sales trends from May through December 2020 are reversed, which may occur, for example, as the cruise line, air travel and hotel industries begin to recover.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have had, and could again have in the future, certain negative impacts on our business including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf previous and potentially future delays in the delivery of certain products from our vendors as a result of shipping delays due to, among other things, additional safety requirements imposed on our suppliers by governmental authorities and capacity constraints experienced by our transportation contractors;\n\u25cf some of our vendors having experienced, and potentially experiencing in the future, temporary facility closures, production slowdowns and disruption to operations as a result of the impact of the pandemic on their respective businesses, such as Thor Industries, Inc.\u2019s temporary closure of its North American production facilities from late March to early May 2020;\n\u25cf disruptions in supply chains that may place constraints on our ability to source products, which may increase our product costs or lead to shortages;\n\u25cf National parks and RV parks temporarily closing, which may again occur in the future, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause consumers to use their RVs less frequently, or be less inclined to need or renew certain of our services or purchase products;\n\u25cf deteriorating economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, which could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services;\n\u25cf insufficient or inefficient protective measures (while we made temporary changes to our operating procedures at our retail locations and offices following recommended guidelines and are taking measures to protect our customers, employees and facilities, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees and our employees may not be as efficient while operating under these temporary procedures, which could result in labor shortages or additional labor costs);\n\u25cf the ability of third-party service providers and business partners, such as cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, and other external business partners, to fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms in light of risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf the possibility of legal claims or litigation against us relating to actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficacy, availability and distribution of vaccines and further actions that may be taken by individuals, businesses and federal, state and local governments in response. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience significant adverse effects to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic recession or downturn and the impact of such a recession or downturn on unemployment levels, consumer confidence, levels of personal discretionary spending and credit availability.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by the availability of financing to it and its customers.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by the availability of financing to it and its customers. Generally, RV dealers finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions. On March 15, 2018, the Company entered into a $200 million credit agreement with M&T Bank including a new floor plan facility that increased the committed floor plan financing to $175.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $105.5 million outstanding under its M&T floor plan facility and $12.8 million outstanding under the M&T term loan. As of December 31, 2020, substantially all of the invoice cost of new RV inventory and 6.1% of book value of pre-owned RV inventory was financed under the floor plan facility. A decrease in the availability of this type of wholesale financing or an increase in the cost of such wholesale financing could prevent the Company from carrying adequate levels of inventory, which may limit product offerings and could lead to reduced sales and revenues.\nFurthermore, many of the Company\u2019s customers finance their RV purchases. Although consumer credit markets are generally favorable, consumer credit market conditions continue to influence demand, especially for RVs, and may continue to do so. There continues to be fewer lenders, more stringent underwriting and loan approval criteria, and greater down payment requirements than in the past. If credit conditions or the credit worthiness of the Company\u2019s customers worsen, and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases on acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in the sales of the Company\u2019s products and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuel shortages, or high prices for fuel, could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nGasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of RVs. There can be no assurance that the supply of these petroleum products will continue uninterrupted, that rationing will not be imposed, that the price of or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future. Shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel have had a material adverse effect on the RV industry as a whole in the past and any such shortages or substantial increases in the price of fuel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the RVs the Company sells.\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency has adopted rules under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles. There are clear indications that the new Administration will refocus attention on greenhouse gases and climate change. The adoption of any laws or regulations requiring significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on vehicles and automotive fuels in the United States could adversely affect demand for those vehicles and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends to a significant extent on the well-being, popularity and reputation for quality, of the Company\u2019s manufacturers, particularly Tiffin Motorhomes, Thor Industries, Inc., Winnebago Industries, Inc., and Forest River, Inc.\nTiffin Motorhomes, Thor Industries, Inc., Winnebago Industries, Inc., and Forest River, Inc. supplied approximately 24.0%, 26.1%, 25.0%, and 19.5%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s purchases of new RV inventory during the year ended December 31, 2020. In December 2020, Thor Industries announced the acquisition of Tiffin Motorhomes. The Company depends on its manufacturers to provide it with products that compare favorably with competing products in terms of quality, performance, safety and advanced features. Any adverse change in the production efficiency, product development efforts, technological advancement, marketplace acceptance, reputation, marketing capabilities or financial condition of the Company\u2019s manufacturers could have a substantial adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. Any difficulties encountered by any of the Company\u2019s manufacturers resulting from economic, financial, or other factors could adversely affect the quality and number of products that they are able to supply to the Company and the services and support they provide to the Company. The interruption or discontinuance of the operations of the Company\u2019s manufacturers could cause the Company to experience shortfalls, disruptions, or delays with respect to needed inventory. Although the Company believes that adequate alternate sources would be available that could replace any manufacturer as a product source, those alternate sources may not be available at the time of any interruption, alternative products may not be available at comparable quality and prices and alternative products may not be equally appealing to the Company\u2019s customers.\nAny change, non-renewal, unfavorable renegotiation or termination of the Company\u2019s supply arrangements for any reason could have a material adverse effect on product availability and cost and the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s supply arrangements with manufacturers are typically governed by dealer agreements, which are customary in the RV industry. The Company\u2019s dealer agreements with manufacturers are generally made on a location-by-location basis, and each retail location typically enters into multiple dealer agreements with multiple manufacturers. The terms of the Company\u2019s dealer agreements are typically subject to the Company meeting program requirements and retail sales objectives, performing services and repairs for customers still under warranty (regardless from whom the RV was purchased), carrying the relevant manufacturer\u2019s parts and accessories needed to service and repair its RVs, actively advertising and promoting the manufacturer\u2019s RVs, and in some instances indemnifying the manufacturer.\nThe Company\u2019s dealer agreements designate a specific geographic territory for the Company, exclusive to the Company, provided that the Company is able to meet the material obligations of the applicable dealer agreement.\nIn addition, many of the Company\u2019s dealer agreements contain contractual provisions concerning minimum advertised product pricing for current model year units. Wholesale pricing is generally established on a model year basis and is subject to change in the manufacturer\u2019s sole discretion. Any change, non-renewal, unfavorable renegotiation or termination of these dealer agreements for any reason could have a material adverse effect on product availability and cost and the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s growth in existing or expansion into new, unfamiliar markets, whether through acquisitions or otherwise, presents risks that could materially affect profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s success will depend, in part, on the ability of the Company to make successful acquisitions and to integrate the operations of acquired retail locations, including centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and pursuing programs and processes that promote cooperation and the sharing of opportunities and resources among the Company\u2019s retail locations and consumer services and plans. The Company may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of its acquisitions within the anticipated timing or at all. For as long as the first year after a substantial acquisition and possibly longer, the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the business and operations.\nIn 2020, the Company acquired three dealerships in Arizona and Indiana. The Company intends to continue to expand in part by acquiring or building new retail or service locations in new markets. As a result, the Company may have less familiarity with local consumer preferences and could encounter difficulties in attracting customers due to a reduced level of consumer familiarity with the Company\u2019s brands.\nOther factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, may impact the Company\u2019s ability to acquire or open retail locations successfully, whether in existing or new markets, and operate them profitably. These factors include (a) the ability to (i) identify suitable acquisition opportunities at purchase prices likely to provide returns required by the Company\u2019s acquisition criteria, (ii) keep expenses associated with sourcing, evaluating and negotiating acquisitions (including those that are not completed) low, (iii) accurately assess the profitability of potential acquisitions or new locations, (iv) secure required governmental permits and approvals, (v) negotiate favorable lease agreements, (vi) hire and train skilled operating personnel, especially management personnel, (vii) provide a satisfactory product mix responsive to local market preferences where new retail locations are built or acquired, (viii) secure product lines, (ix) supply new retail locations with inventory in a timely manner; (b) the availability of construction materials and labor for new retail locations and the occurrence of significant construction delays or cost overruns; (c) competitors in the same geographic area and regional economic variants; (d) the absence of disagreements with potential acquisition targets that could lead to litigation; (e) successfully integrating the operations of acquired dealers with the Company\u2019s own operations; (f) managing acquired dealers and stores profitably without substantial costs, delays, or other operational or financial problems; and (g) the ability of the Company\u2019s information management systems to process increased information accurately and in a timely fashion. A negative outcome associated with any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOnce the Company decides on a new market and identifies a suitable acquisition or location opportunity, any delays in acquiring or opening or developing new retail locations could impact the Company\u2019s financial results. For example, delays in the acquisition process or construction delays caused by permitting or licensing issues, material shortages, labor issues, weather delays or other acts of God, discovery of contaminants, accidents, deaths or injuries, third parties attempting to impose unsatisfactory restrictions on the Company in connection with their approval of acquisitions, and other factors could delay planned openings or force the Company to abandon planned openings altogether.\nAs the Company grows, it will face the risk that its existing resources and systems, including management resources, accounting and finance personnel and operating systems, may be inadequate to support its growth.\nFinally, the size, timing, and integration of any future new retail location openings or acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations in the Company\u2019s results of operations from quarter to quarter. Consequently, the Company\u2019s results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year. These fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain the strength and value of the Company\u2019s brands could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on the value and strength of the Lazydays brands. The Lazydays name and Lazydays brands are integral to the Company\u2019s business as well as to the implementation of the Company\u2019s strategies for expanding its business. Maintaining, enhancing, promoting and positioning the Company\u2019s brands, particularly in new markets where the Company has limited brand recognition, will depend largely on the success of the Company\u2019s marketing efforts and its ability to provide high quality products, services, protection plans, and resources and a consistent, high quality customer experience. The Company\u2019s brands could be adversely affected if (a) the Company fails to achieve these objectives or to comply with local laws and regulations; (b) the Company is subject to publicized litigation; or (c) the Company\u2019s public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Some of these risks are not within the Company\u2019s control, such as the effects of negative publicity regarding the Company\u2019s manufacturers, suppliers or third party providers of services or negative publicity related to members of management. Any of these events could result in decreases in revenues. Further, maintaining, enhancing, promoting and positioning the Company\u2019s brand image may require the Company to make substantial investments in areas such as marketing, dealership operations, community relations, store graphics and employee training, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and profitability. Furthermore, efforts to maintain, enhance or promote the Company\u2019s brand image may ultimately be unsuccessful. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to successfully procure and manage its inventory to reflect consumer demand in a volatile market and anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to successfully manage the Company\u2019s inventory and to anticipate and respond to product trends and consumer demands in a timely manner. The preferences of the Company\u2019s target consumers cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. The Company may order products in advance of the following selling season. Extended lead times for the Company\u2019s purchases may make it difficult for the Company to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends, increases or decreases in consumer demand or changes in prices. If the Company misjudges either the market for the Company\u2019s products or its consumers\u2019 purchasing habits in the future, the Company\u2019s revenues may decline significantly, the Company may not have sufficient inventory to satisfy consumer demand or sales orders, or the Company may be required to discount excess inventory; all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is impacted by general economic conditions, ongoing economic and financial uncertainties, and or a change in consumer tastes, may cause a decline in consumer spending that may adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on consumer discretionary spending and, accordingly, the Company may be adversely affected if its customers reduce, delay or forego their purchases of the Company\u2019s products, services, and protection plans as a result of, including but not limited to, job loss, bankruptcy, higher consumer debt and interest rates, reduced access to credit, higher energy and fuel costs, relative or perceived cost, availability and comfort of RV use versus other modes of travel, such as air travel and rail (including as a result of consumer tastes in response to climate change), falling home prices, lower consumer confidence, uncertain or changes in tax policies, uncertainty due to national or international security or health concerns, volatility in the stock market, or epidemics.\nDecreases in the number of customers, average spend per customer, or retention and renewal rates for the Company\u2019s consumer services and plans would negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial performance. A prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, adverse economic conditions may result in an increase in the Company\u2019s operating expenses due to, among other things, higher costs of labor, energy, equipment and facilities. Due to recent fluctuations in the U.S. economy and the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company\u2019s sales, operating and financial results for a particular period are difficult to predict, making it difficult to forecast results for future periods. Additionally, the Company is subject to economic fluctuations in local markets that may not reflect the general economic conditions of the broader U.S. economy. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in the market for services, protection plans and products targeting the RV lifestyle or RV enthusiast could reduce the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nCompetition in the RV market is fragmented, driven by price, product and service features, technology, performance, reliability, quality, availability, variety, delivery and customer service. In addition to competing with other dealers of new and pre-owned RVs, the Company competes directly or indirectly with major national insurance and warranty companies, providers of roadside assistance and providers of extended service contracts.\nAdditional competitors may enter the businesses in which the Company currently operates. If any of the Company\u2019s competitors successfully provides a broader, more efficient or attractive combination of services, protection plans and products to the Company\u2019s target customers, the Company\u2019s business results could be materially adversely affected. The Company\u2019s inability to compete effectively with existing or potential competitors, some of which may have greater resources or be better positioned to absorb economic downturns in local markets, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s same store sales may fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nThe Company\u2019s same store sales may vary from quarter to quarter. A number of factors affect and will continue to affect the Company\u2019s same store sales results, including: (a) changes or anticipated changes to regulations related to the products the Company offers; (b) consumer preferences and buying trends; (c) overall economic trends; (d) the Company\u2019s ability to identify and respond effectively to local and regional trends and customer preferences; (e) the Company\u2019s ability to provide quality customer service that will increase its conversion of shoppers into paying customers; (f) competition in the regional market of a store; (g) extreme weather patterns; (h) changes in the Company\u2019s product mix; (i) changes to local or regional regulations affecting the Company\u2019s stores; (j) changes in sales of consumer services and plans and retention and renewal rates for the Company\u2019s annually renewing consumer services and plans; and (k) changes in pricing and average unit sales.\nAn unanticipated decline in revenues or same store sales could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cyclical nature of the Company\u2019s business has caused its sales and results of operations to fluctuate. These fluctuations may continue in the future, which could result in operating losses during downturns.\nThe RV industry is cyclical and is influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors, including (a) the terms and availability of financing for retailers and consumers; (b) overall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending; (c) population and employment trends; and (d) income levels and general economic conditions, such as inflation, including as a result of tariffs, deflation, increasing interest rates and recessions. As a result of these factors, the Company\u2019s sales and results of operations have fluctuated, and the Company expects that they will continue to fluctuate in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s business is seasonal, and this leads to fluctuations in sales and revenues.\nThe Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, variability in revenue, net income and cash flows as a result of seasonality in its business. Because the Company\u2019s largest dealership is located in the southern United States, demand for services, protection plans, products and resources generally increases during the winter season when people move south for the winter or vacation in warmer climates, while sales and profits are generally lower during the summer months. In addition, unusually severe weather conditions in some geographic areas may impact demand. This includes the threat of hurricanes in Florida, which could substantially damage property and inventory in the Company\u2019s Florida dealerships, especially in Tampa, and lead to a material disruption of operations at the Company\u2019s Tampa, Florida headquarters and dealership.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company generated 51% and 53% (excluding the impact of acquisitions) of its annual revenue in the first and second fiscal quarters, respectively, which include the peak winter months. The COVID pandemic affected our sales patterns in December 2020. The Company incurs additional expenses in the first and second fiscal quarters due to higher purchase volumes, increased staffing in the Company\u2019s retail locations and program costs. If, for any reason, the Company miscalculates the demand for its products or its product mix during the first and second fiscal quarters, the Company\u2019s sales in these quarters could decline, resulting in higher labor costs as a percentage of sales, lower margins and excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the Company\u2019s seasonality, the possible adverse impact from other risks associated with its business, including extreme weather, consumer spending levels and general business conditions, is potentially greater if any such risks occur during the Company\u2019s peak sales seasons.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in its local markets, even if those conditions are not prominent nationally.\nSince a large portion of the Company\u2019s sales are generated in Florida, the Company\u2019s results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in the Southeastern United States. In the event that this geographic area experiences a downturn in economic conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company primarily leases its retail locations and if the Company is unable to maintain those leases or locate alternative sites for retail locations in its target markets and on terms that are acceptable to it, the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company leases 7 of the 11 real properties where it has operations. At inception of the leases, they generally provide for fixed monthly rentals with escalation clauses and range from five to twenty years. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its existing retail locations as leases expire, extend the leases or be able to locate alternative sites in its target markets and on favorable terms. Any failure to maintain its existing retail locations, extend the leases or locate alternative sites on favorable or acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be unable to enforce its intellectual property rights and/or the Company may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company owns a variety of registered trademarks and service marks. The Company believes that its trademarks have significant value and are important to its marketing efforts. If the Company is unable to continue to protect the trademarks and service marks for its proprietary brands, if such marks become generic or if third parties adopt marks similar to the Company\u2019s marks, the Company\u2019s ability to differentiate its products and services may be diminished. In the event that the Company\u2019s trademarks or service marks are successfully challenged by third parties, the Company could lose brand recognition and be forced to devote additional resources to advertising and marketing new brands for its products.\nFrom time to time, the Company may be compelled to protect its intellectual property, which may involve litigation. Such litigation may be time-consuming, expensive and distract the Company\u2019s management from running the day-to-day operations of its business, and could result in the impairment or loss of the involved intellectual property. There is no guarantee that the steps the Company takes to protect its intellectual property, including litigation when necessary, will be successful. The loss or reduction of any of the Company\u2019s significant intellectual property rights could diminish the Company\u2019s ability to distinguish its products and services from competitors\u2019 products and services and retain its market share for its proprietary products and services. The Company\u2019s inability to effectively protect the Company\u2019s proprietary intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOther parties also may claim that the Company infringes on their proprietary rights. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against the Company or the payment of damages. These claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations applicable to the sale of extended service contracts could materially impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company offers extended service contracts that may be purchased as a supplement to the original purchaser\u2019s warranty as well as other optional products to protect the consumer\u2019s investment. These products are subject to complex federal and state laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which these products are offered will not seek to further regulate or restrict these products. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines or other penalties including orders by state regulators to discontinue sales of the warranty products in one or more jurisdictions. Such a result could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird parties bear the majority of the administration and liability obligations associated with these extended service contracts upon purchase by the customer. State laws and regulations, however, may limit or condition the Company\u2019s ability to transfer these administration and liability obligations to third parties, which could in turn impact the way revenue is recognized from these products. Failure to comply with these laws could result in fines or other penalties, including orders by state regulators to discontinue sales of these product offerings as currently structured. Such a result could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf state dealer laws are repealed or weakened, the Company\u2019s dealerships will be more susceptible to termination, non-renewal or renegotiation of dealer agreements.\nState dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non-renewal. Some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or attempt to comply with the manufacturer\u2019s criteria within a specified notice period to avoid the termination or non-renewal. Manufacturers have been lobbying and continue to lobby for the repeal or revision of state dealer laws. If dealer laws are repealed in the states in which the Company operates, or manufacturers convince legislators to pass legislation in those states allowing termination or non-renewal of dealerships without cause, manufacturers may be able to terminate the Company\u2019s dealer agreements without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause. Without the protection of state dealer laws, it may also be more difficult for the Company to renew its dealer agreements upon expiration.\nThe ability of a manufacturer to grant additional dealer agreements is based on a number of factors which the Company cannot control. If manufacturers grant new dealer agreements in areas near the Company\u2019s existing markets, such new dealer agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Our Debt Obligations\nThe Company may not be able to satisfy its debt obligations upon the occurrence of a change in control under its credit facility.\nA change in control is an event of default under the credit facility. Upon the occurrence of a change in control, M&T Bank will have the right to declare all outstanding obligations under the credit facility immediately due and payable and to terminate the availability of future advances to the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s lenders will agree to an amendment of the credit facility or a waiver of any such event of default. There can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient resources available to satisfy all of its obligations under the credit facility if no waiver or amendment is obtained. In the event the Company was unable to satisfy these obligations, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to operate and expand its business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will depend on the availability of adequate capital.\nThe operation of the Company\u2019s business, the rate of the Company\u2019s expansion and the Company\u2019s ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends on cash flow generated by the Company\u2019s business and, if necessary, the availability of equity or debt capital. The Company also requires sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations under its existing debt agreements. The Company\u2019s term loan requires it to pay monthly principal installments of $0.242 million plus accrued interest through the maturity date. At the maturity date, the Company will pay a principal balloon payment of $11.3 million plus accrued interest.\nThe Company is dependent to a significant extent on its ability to finance its new and certain of its pre-owned RV inventory under the credit facility. Floor plan financing arrangements allow the Company to borrow money to purchase new RVs from the manufacturer or pre-owned RVs on trade-in or at auction and pay off the loan when the Company sells the financed RV. The Company may need to increase the capacity of its existing credit facility in connection with its acquisition of dealerships and overall growth. In the event that the Company is unable to obtain such incremental financing, the Company\u2019s ability to complete acquisitions could be limited.\nThe Company cannot ensure that its cash flow from operations or cash available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its needs. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under its credit facility is not sufficient, the Company may have to obtain additional financing. If the Company obtains additional capital through the issuance of equity, the interests of existing stockholders of the Company may be diluted. If the Company incurs additional indebtedness, such indebtedness may contain significant financial covenants and other negative covenants that may significantly restrict the Company\u2019s ability to operate. The Company cannot ensure that it could obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may impair the Company\u2019s ability to access sufficient capital and operate its business.\nThe Company\u2019s credit facility contains various provisions that limit the Company\u2019s ability to, among other things: (a) incur additional indebtedness or liens; (b) consolidate or merge; (c) alter the business conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries; (d) make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions; (e) sell assets, including capital stock of its subsidiaries; (f) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; (g) pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or certain other indebtedness; (h) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (i) and enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants contained in the documentation governing the credit facility require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with those financial ratios may be affected by events beyond its control, and its failure to comply with these ratios could result in an event of default. The restrictive covenants may affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate and finance its business as it deems appropriate. The Company\u2019s inability to meet obligations as they become due or to comply with various financial covenants contained in the instruments governing its current or future indebtedness could constitute an event of default under the instruments governing the Company\u2019s indebtedness.\nIf there were an event of default under the instruments governing the Company\u2019s indebtedness, the holders of the affected indebtedness could declare all of the affected indebtedness immediately due and payable, which, in turn, could cause the acceleration of the maturity of all of the Company\u2019s other indebtedness. The Company may not have sufficient funds available, or the Company may not have access to sufficient capital from other sources, to repay any accelerated debt. Even if the Company could obtain additional financing, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to the Company. In addition, substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets are subject to liens securing the obligations under the credit facility. If amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accelerated, the Company\u2019s lenders could foreclose on these liens and the Company could lose substantially all of its assets. Any event of default under the instruments governing the Company\u2019s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on its relationships with third party providers of services, protection plans, products and resources and a disruption of these relationships or of these providers\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends in part on developing and maintaining productive relationships with third party providers of products, services, protection plans, and resources that the Company markets to its customers. Additionally, the Company relies on certain third party providers to support its products, services, protection plans, and resources, including insurance carriers for the Company\u2019s property and casualty insurance and extended service contracts, banks and captive financing companies for vehicle financing and refinancing. The Company cannot accurately predict whether, or the extent to which, it will experience any disruption in the supply of products from its vendors or services from its third party providers. Any such disruption could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to market and sell its products, services, protection plans, and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to the insurance programs that the Company offers, the Company is dependent on the insurance carriers that underwrite the insurance to obtain appropriate regulatory approvals and maintain compliance with insurance regulations. If such carriers do not obtain appropriate state regulatory approvals or comply with such changing regulations, the Company may be required to use an alternative carrier or change its insurance products or cease marketing certain insurance related products in certain states, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. If the Company is required to use an alternative insurance carrier or change its insurance related products, it may materially increase the time required to bring an insurance related product to market. Any disruption in the Company\u2019s service offerings could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and result in customer dissatisfaction.\nAdditionally, the Company provides financing to qualified customers through a number of third party financing providers. If one or more of these third party providers ceases to provide financing to the Company\u2019s customers, provides financing to fewer customers or no longer provides financing on competitive terms, or if the Company is unable to replace the current third party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is from financing, insurance and extended service contracts, which depend on third party lenders and insurance companies. The Company cannot ensure these third parties will continue to provide RV financing and other products.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s revenue comes from the fees the Company receives from lending institutions and insurance companies for arranging financing and insurance coverage for the Company\u2019s customers. The lending institution pays the Company a fee for each loan that it arranges. If these lenders were to lend to the Company\u2019s customers directly rather than through the Company, the Company would not receive a fee. In addition, if customers prepay financing the Company arranged within a specified period (generally within six months of making the loan), the Company is required to rebate (or \u201cchargeback\u201d) all or a portion of the commissions paid to the Company by the lending institution. The same process applies to vehicle services contract fees, which are also subject to chargebacks if a customer chooses to terminate the contract early. The Company receives a chargeback for a portion of the initial fees received. The Company\u2019s revenues from financing fees and vehicle service contract fees are recorded net of a reserve for estimated future chargebacks based on historical operating results. Lending institutions may change the criteria or terms they use to make loan decisions, which could reduce the number of customers for whom the Company can arrange financing, or may elect to not continue to provide these products with respect to RVs. The Company\u2019s customers may also use the internet or other electronic methods to find financing alternatives. If any of these events occur, the Company could lose a significant portion of its income and profit.\nFurthermore, new and pre-owned vehicles may be sold and financed through retail installment sales contracts entered into between the Company and third-party purchasers. Prior to entering into a retail installment sales contract with a third-party purchaser, the Company typically has a commitment from a third-party lender for the assignment of such retail installment sales contract, subject to final review, approval and verification of the retail installment sales contract, related documentation and the information contained therein. Retail installment sales contracts are typically assigned by the Company to third-party lenders simultaneously with the execution of the retail installment sales contracts. Contracts in transit represent amounts due from third-party lenders from whom pre-arranged assignment agreements have been determined, and to whom the retail installment sales contract have been assigned. The Company recognizes revenue when the applicable new or pre-owned vehicle is delivered and the Company has assigned the retail installment sales contract to a third-party lender and collectability is reasonably assured. Funding from the third-party lender is provided upon receipt, final review, approval and verification of the retail installment sales contract, related documentation and the information contained therein. Retail installment sales contracts are typically funded within ten days of the initial approval of the retail installment sales contract by the third-party lender. Contracts in transit are included in current assets and totaled $16.0 million and $11.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Any defaults on these retail installment sales contracts could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation, including regulations with respect to the Company\u2019s RV sales, RV financing, marketing, direct mail, roadside assistance programs and insurance activities. New regulatory efforts may be proposed from time to time that may affect the way the Company operates its businesses. For example, in the past a principal source of leads for the Company\u2019s direct response marketing efforts was new vehicle registrations provided by motor vehicle departments in various states. Currently, all states restrict access to motor vehicle registration information.\nThe Company is also subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight, length and width of motor vehicles that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions.\nFurther, certain federal and state laws and regulations affect the Company\u2019s activities. Areas of the Company\u2019s business affected by such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, labor, advertising, consumer protection, digital marketing, real estate, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property, tax, import and export, anti-corruption, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. Compliance with these laws and others may be onerous and costly, at times, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction which further complicates compliance efforts.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (\u201cBCFP\u201d), an independent federal agency with broad regulatory powers and limited oversight from the United States Congress. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded, the Dodd-Frank Act could lead to additional, indirect regulation of automotive dealers, in particular, their sale and marketing of finance and insurance products, through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions\nIn addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, may increase the Company\u2019s annual employee health care costs that it funds and has increased the Company\u2019s cost of compliance and compliance risk related to offering health care benefits. Efforts to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act and/or adopt a replacement healthcare reform law may impact the Company\u2019s employee healthcare costs. If healthcare costs rise, the Company may experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the Company\u2019s property and casualty insurance programs that it offers through third party insurance carriers are subject to state laws and regulations governing the business of insurance, including, without limitation, laws and regulations governing the administration, underwriting, marketing, solicitation or sale of insurance products. The Company\u2019s third party insurance carriers are required to apply for, renew, and maintain licenses issued by state, federal or foreign regulatory authorities. Such regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke such licenses. Accordingly, any failure by such parties to comply with the then current licensing requirements, which may include any determination of financial instability by such regulatory authorities, could result in such regulatory authorities denying third party insurance carriers\u2019 initial or renewal applications for such licenses, modifying the terms of licenses or revoking licenses that they currently possess, which could severely inhibit the Company\u2019s ability to market these insurance products. Additionally, certain state laws and regulations govern the form and content of certain disclosures that must be made in connection with the sale, advertising or offer of any insurance program to a consumer. The Company reviews all marketing materials it disseminates to the public for compliance with applicable insurance regulations. The Company is required to maintain certain licenses and approvals in order to market insurance products.\nThe Company has instituted various comprehensive policies and procedures to address compliance. However, there can be no assurance that employees, contractors, vendors or the Company\u2019s agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with certain environmental regulations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires and propane. Consequently, the Company\u2019s business is subject to federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety. The Company may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could cause the Company to become subject to fines and penalties or otherwise have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the Company has indemnified certain of its landlords for any hazardous waste which may be found on or about property the Company leases. If any such hazardous waste were to be found on property that the Company occupies, a significant claim giving rise to the Company\u2019s indemnity obligation could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Stock\nFuture resales of the shares of common stock of the Company issued to the stockholders and the investors in the Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) Investment may cause the market price of the Company\u2019s securities to drop significantly, even if the Company\u2019s business is doing well.\nThe Company is party to a registration rights agreement pursuant to which certain stockholders have been granted certain demand and \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights with respect to their securities. Additionally, the investors who simultaneously with the closing of the Merger purchased convertible preferred stock, common stock and warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $94.8 million (the \u201cPIPE Investment\u201d) were granted registration rights pursuant to which the Company filed a registration statement covering the resale of granted securities. This resale registration statement is currently effective.\nFurthermore, the stockholders and investors in the PIPE Investment may sell Company common stock pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under a registration statement. In these cases, the resales must meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of that rule.\nSubject to the continuing effectiveness of the resale registration statement or upon satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the stockholders and investors in the PIPE Investment may sell large amounts of Company common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which could have the effect of increasing the volatility in the Company\u2019s stock price or putting significant downward pressure on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock, warrants and options may have an adverse effect on the market price of its common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding (i) stock options issued to the board of directors and employees to purchase 4,063,362 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $5.05 to $14.68 per share, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 300,357 shares of common stock that were issued in the PIPE Investment, (iii) warrants to purchase 2,493,887 shares of our common stock at $11.50 per share issued in the PIPE Investment, (iv) warrants to purchase 2,138,200 shares of our common stock at $11.50 per share held by Andina public shareholders, and (v) 600,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are convertible into up to 5,962,733 shares of common stock, taking into account any accrued dividends which we may elect to pay in cash or shares of common stock. We may also issue additional equity awards under our Amended and Restated 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \u201cAmended 2018 Plan\u201d).\nThe sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants, stock options and Series A Preferred Stock and the shares issuable under the Amended 2018 Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these warrants and stock options are exercised or the Series A Preferred Stock is converted to common stock, you may experience substantial dilution to your holdings.\nThe conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into Company common stock may dilute the value for the other holders of Company common stock.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into Company common stock. As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, the existing holders of Company common stock will own a smaller percentage of the outstanding Company common stock. Further, additional Company common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Series A Preferred Stock, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of Company common stock.\nIf the Series A Preferred Stock is converted into Company common stock, holders of such converted Company common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as other holders of Company common stock. As such, another dilutive effect which may result from the conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be a dilution to dividends and distributions receivable on account of Company common stock.\nThe holders of Series A Preferred Stock own a large portion of the voting power of the Company common stock and have the right to designate two members to the Company\u2019s board of directors. This significantly influences the composition of the board of directors of the Company and future actions taken by the board of directors of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s board of directors currently has six members. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are exclusively entitled to designate two members to the Company\u2019s board of directors. In addition, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company common stock have the right to vote and are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of Company common stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate. These matters include the election of all director nominees not designated by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have significant influence on the composition of the Company\u2019s board of directors.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock held approximately 38.5% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis, taking into account the accrued dividends which we may elect to pay in cash or shares of common stock. As a result, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring stockholder approval.\nPursuant to the Certificate of Designations governing the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock must consent to the Company taking certain actions, including among others, the increase in the number of directors constituting the Company\u2019s board of directors above eight members, the incurrence of certain indebtedness and the sale of certain assets. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are not obligated to consent to any specific action and there can be no assurance that the holders will consent to any action the Company\u2019s board of directors determines is in the best interests of its stockholders as a whole.\nAdditionally, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have been granted a right of first refusal on certain debt financings. Pursuant to this right, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have 15 business days to determine whether they want to undertake a covered debt financing. This may delay the Company\u2019s ability to undertake a debt financing and may cause certain third parties to be less willing to engage in any debt financing with the Company. As a shareholder Series A Preferred shareholders could negatively impact your investment and may not take actions that will be in your best interest.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company is no longer an emerging growth company and will be required to comply with more stringent reporting requirements as a public company.\nThe Company is no longer an emerging growth company and as such will no longer qualify for certain accommodations under SEC rules and regulations. While the Company\u2019s scaled disclosure will remain substantially the same so long as it qualifies as a smaller reporting company, if the Company\u2019s public float exceeds $75 million on June 30, 2021, the Company will become an accelerated filer in 2022 and will be required to produce an auditor\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in its annual report for the year ending December 31, 2021. As a result, the Company\u2019s compliance costs would increase.\nIf our board of directors approve a new stock repurchase program, it could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nIn November 2019, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to a maximum of $4.0 million of our shares of common stock through December 31, 2020. If our board decides to renew this program, repurchases may be made at management\u2019s discretion from time to time in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to a trading plan subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. There can be no assurance that we would buy shares of our common stock or the timeframe for repurchases under our stock repurchase program or that any repurchases would have a positive impact on our stock price or earnings per share.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides to the fullest extent permitted by law that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its stockholders, which could increase the costs to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers or employees.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not apply to actions arising under the federal securities laws and will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company depends on its ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products, services, protection plans, and resources. The extent to which the Company achieves growth in its customer base materially influences the Company\u2019s profitability. Any number of factors could affect the Company\u2019s ability to grow its customer base. These factors include consumer preferences and general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its retail locations, weather conditions, the availability of alternative products, significant increases in gasoline prices, the disposable income of consumers available for discretionary expenditures and the external perception of the Company\u2019s brands. Any significant decline in the Company\u2019s customer base, the rate of growth of its customer base or customer demand could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company is unable to protect, maintain or upgrade its information technology systems or if the Company is unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, the Company\u2019s operations may be disrupted or become less efficient.\nThe Company depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient operation of its business. The Company relies on hardware, telecommunications and software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these information technology systems so that the Company can continue to operate its business. Various components of the Company\u2019s information technology systems, including hardware, networks, and software, are licensed to the Company by third party vendors. The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results and efficiently manage its business. Additionally, because the Company accepts debit and credit cards for payment, the Company is subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (the \u201cPCI Standard\u201d), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The PCI Standard contains various compliance guidelines with respect to the Company\u2019s security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data. The Company is currently in compliance with the PCI Standard, however, complying with the PCI Standard and implementing related procedures, technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention to compliance. Costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as those necessary to maintain compliance with the PCI Standard or with respect to maintenance or support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the Company\u2019s operations. Any material interruptions or failures in the Company\u2019s payment-related systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology systems or breaches of the Company\u2019s network security could interrupt its operations, compromise its reputation, expose it to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on the integrity, security and successful functioning of its information technology systems and network infrastructure across the Company\u2019s operations. The Company uses information technology systems to, among other things, support its consumer services and plans, manage procurement, manage its supply chain, track inventory information at its retail locations, communicate customer information and aggregate daily sales, margin and promotional information. The Company also uses information systems to report and audit its operational results.\nIn connection with sales, the Company transmits encrypted confidential credit and debit card information. Although the Company is currently in compliance with the PCI Standard, there can be no assurance that in the future the Company will be able to remain compliant with the PCI Standard or other industry recommended or contractually required practices. Even if the Company continues to be compliant with such standards, it still may not be able to prevent security breaches.\nThe Company also has access to, collects or maintains private or confidential information regarding its customers, associates and suppliers, as well as the Company\u2019s business. The protection of the Company\u2019s customer, associate, supplier and company data is critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across the Company\u2019s business and operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attacks and other security breaches. The Company has procedures in place to safeguard its customer\u2019s data and information. However, a significant breach of customer, employee, supplier, or company data could attract a substantial amount of negative media attention, damage the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers and suppliers, harm the Company\u2019s reputation and result in lost sales, fines and/or lawsuits.\nAn increasingly significant portion of the Company\u2019s sales depends on the continuing operation of its information technology and communications systems, including but not limited to its point-of-sale system and its credit card processing systems. The Company\u2019s information technology, communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, acts of war or terrorist attacks, floods, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, power loss and outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, unauthorized data breaches, usage errors by the Company\u2019s associates or the Company\u2019s contractors or other attempts to harm the Company\u2019s systems, including cyber-security attacks, hacking by third parties, computer viruses or other breaches of cardholder data. Some of the Company\u2019s information technology and communication systems are not fully redundant and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the Company\u2019s information technology and communications systems. Any errors or vulnerabilities in the Company\u2019s information technology and communications systems, or damage to or failure of its information technology and communications systems, could result in interruptions in the Company\u2019s services and non-compliance with certain regulations or expose the Company to risk of litigation and liability, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products the Company sells and may be adversely impacted by manufacturer safety recalls.\nSome of the products the Company sells may expose the Company to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Although the Company maintains liability insurance, the Company cannot be certain that its insurance coverage will be adequate for losses actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to the Company on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s agreements with its vendors and sellers do not indemnify the Company from losses attributable to product liability. In addition, even if a product liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding a product recall or any assertion that the products sold by the Company caused property damage or personal injury could damage the Company\u2019s brand image and its reputation with existing and potential consumers and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in achieving their purposes.\nThe Company\u2019s policies, procedures, controls and oversight to monitor and manage its enterprise risks may not be fully effective in achieving their purpose and may leave the Company exposed to identified or unidentified risks. Past or future misconduct by the Company\u2019s employees or vendors could result in violations of law by the Company, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm to the Company. The Company monitors its policies, procedures and controls; however, there can be no assurance that these will be sufficient to prevent all forms of misconduct. The Company reviews its compensation policies and practices as part of the Company\u2019s overall enterprise risk management program, but it is possible that its compensation policies could incentivize inappropriate risk taking or misconduct. If such inappropriate risks or misconduct occurs, it is possible that it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company could incur asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\nThe Company has a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. At least annually, the Company reviews goodwill, trademarks and tradenames for impairment. Long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The Company\u2019s determination of future cash flows, future recoverability and fair value of the Company\u2019s long-lived assets includes significant estimates and assumptions. Changes in those estimates and/or assumptions or lower than anticipated future financial performance may result in the identification of an impaired asset and a non-cash impairment charge, which could be material. Any such charge could adversely affect the Company.", "PERMNO": 17365, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "LAZY"}
