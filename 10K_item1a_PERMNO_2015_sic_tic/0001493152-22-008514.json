Risk Factors\nDiscussion of our business and operations included in this Annual Report should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, or prospects in a material and adverse manner. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. Each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of our securities. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this Annual Report (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future developments.\nThe Company generates limited revenue from operations upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be made. The Company\u2019s prospects must be considered keeping in mind the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a new business in a constantly changing industry. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve profitable operations in the foreseeable future, if at all.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business and an investment in our common stock is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section immediately following this summary. Some of these risks include:\n\u25cf We have a history of operating losses, have been and will continue to be reliant on debt and equity financings to fund our operations, and we may not be able to raise capital when needed or otherwise take action necessary to achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u25cf Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\u25cf Our mining operating costs, including the costs to operate, maintain, repair and replace our mining equipment, have historically outpaced our mining revenues, which has and could continue to put a strain on our business or increase our losses.\n\u25cf We are reliant upon Mr. Robert B. Ladd, our Chief Executive Officer and sole executive officer, the loss of whom could materially harm our ability to continue or grow our operations as planned or at all. For example, he is subject to a pending SEC action which could affect his ability to serve us if he is found to be culpable.\n\u25cf The cryptocurrency mining industry is highly competitive, with many of our competitors having better access to capital and may buy mining equipment at scale. The competition has intensified as the price of Bitcoin has appreciated in recent years, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if we are unable to keep up.\n\u25cf Because we have a single mining facility at one location, if we were to experience damage or loss of this facility, which may be uninsured or underinsured, your investment in us would be at risk.\n\u25cf Our operations and the results thereof are subject to risks arising from Internet disruptions or delays, cybersecurity threats, incorrect digital recording of transactions, and other contingencies resulting from holding and transacting in digital assets. Further, due to current lack of regulation, we may be unable to seek or obtain recourse if such contingencies were to occur.\n\u25cf Our operations and ability to generate revenue depends on a steady supply of low-cost electricity, and with our current electrical contract with the municipal government in Lafayette, Georgia expired in September 2021, our ability to continue to receive a relatively low-cost power supply remains uncertain.\n\u25cf The future development and growth of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If the market for Bitcoin does not grow as we expect, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\u25cf Certain features of Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain, such as \u201cforking\u201d in which one type of Bitcoin could turn into many due to source code variation, or Halving which reduces the rewards for mining efforts by 50% every 210,000 blocks that are solved, pose the risk of adversely affecting our ability to generate revenue.\n\u25cf Our operating results have and will significantly fluctuate due to the highly volatile nature of Bitcoin, and if the price of Bitcoin declines, including potentially due to political, economic, or other forces beyond our control, it would materially adversely affect our business. Our current miners are designed primarily to mine Bitcoin and cannot be used to mine other cryptocurrencies, which magnifies the risk.\n\u25cf Our reliance on third party \u201cmining pools,\u201d which enable us to cooperate with other Bitcoin mining enterprises to receive Bitcoin with less variance in probability of reward by sharing Bitcoin earned pro rata based on contribution to a block solved, subjects us to risks of inaccurate sharing of rewards and the loss of other at-will participants in the pool.\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our operations and those of our vendors, suppliers and other third parties on which we rely, and we may not be able to obtain new miners or replacement parts for our existing miners in a timely or cost-effective manner, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u25cf We may become subject to an uncertain and rapidly evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations, including those imposing restrictions or bans on Bitcoin mining due to concerns about high electrical power usage, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\u25cf The markets for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be under-regulated and, as a result, the market price of Bitcoin may be subject to significant volatility or manipulation, which could decrease consumer confidence in cryptocurrencies and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u25cf Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u25cf If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of the Bitcoin network, such actor or botnet could manipulate the Blockchain to adversely affect us.\n\u25cf Because cryptocurrencies may be determined to be investment securities, we may inadvertently violate or become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 and incur large losses as a result and potentially be required to register as an investment company or terminate operations.\n\u25cf Our stock price is subject to significant volatility due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including its status as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d the fact that it is not listed on a national securities exchange, and its potential connection to the price of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, which could adversely affect investors.\n\u25cf We have not paid cash dividends to our stockholders and do not intend to do so in the foreseeable future.\n\u25cf Substantial future sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders could have a depressive effect on our stock price. For example, Company has issued warrants that allow the holders to exercise for an indeterminant, and potentially material, number of shares of our common stock on a cashless basis.\nRisks Related to Our Cryptocurrency Mining Business\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur primary focus is on our Bitcoin mining operation located at our Lafayette, Georgia facility where as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we operated a total of 480 and 430 S17 miners, respectively. Our current strategy will continue to expose us to the numerous risks and volatility associated within this sector, including due to the high costs of purchasing miners and sourcing power for them, while monitoring the price of Bitcoin, which has historically been volatile. Further, we have experienced recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1,539 and $3,887, respectively.\nTo date, we have relied on debt or equity financings to fund our operations, and if the price of Bitcoin is not sufficiently high to enable us to sell the Bitcoin we mine at prices above our cost to mine it, then we are likely to continue to be unable to fund our operations without raising additional capital. Further, even if prices are sufficiently high for our mining activities, we are likely to need to raise additional capital to fund the acquisition of new miners to repair or replace our existing miners and expand our number of miners to be competitive.\nWe expect to incur additional net losses over the next several years as we seek to expand operations. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain. If we are unsuccessful at executing on our business plan, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur auditors have issued a \u201cgoing concern\u201d audit opinion.\nOur independent auditors have indicated in their report on our December 31, 2021 and 2020 financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion indicates that the financial statements incorporated in this Annual Report have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to shareholders, in the event of liquidation.\nOur mining operating costs have historically outpaced our mining revenues, which has and could continue to put a strain on our business or increase our losses.\nOur mining operations are costly and our expenses may increase in the future. This expense increase may not be offset by a corresponding increase in revenue. Our expenses may be greater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business more efficient may not succeed and may outpace monetization efforts. Increases in our costs without a corresponding increase in our revenue would increase our losses and could seriously harm our business and financial performance.\nThe cost of obtaining new and replacement miners and parts has historically been and will likely continue to be highly capital intensive which may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with mining Bitcoin are lower than the price of the Bitcoin we mine when we sell them. Our miners are subject to ordinary wear and tear from operation and may also face more significant malfunctions caused by factors which may be beyond our control. For example, approximately 450 of our S17 miners have experienced glitches and defects and as a result have seen either limitations on mining capabilities or outright inability to mine, such that they had to be or will have to be replaced or repaired. The result of this development has not only been increased costs to us, but also a reduced ability to generate revenue while these miners were not operating, whether because they were under repair and/or failing to operate at their optimal hash rate. Circumstances such as these, or a general need to replace outdated miners in the future, are highly cost intensive and can be a serious hindrance on our mining operations and ability to generate revenue or obtain profitability.\nAdditionally, as the mining technology evolves, we may need to acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive in the market. Over time, we may replace those miners which are no longer functional or efficient or powerful enough with new miners purchased from third-party manufacturers, the cost of which may be higher than what we spent on prior models and/or such that we will need to raise more capital to do so. For instance, the price of Bitcoin miners has historically been somewhat correlated to the price of Bitcoin, which has appreciated in recent years. Depending on the price of new miners and our operational needs at the time we decide to replace miners in the future, we may have to do so at higher costs than we could have previously, which would add to our losses. Alternatively, even absent defects or reductions in computing power, mining machine models are upgraded frequently, and we are and will continue to be subject to either higher competitive pressure as a result, or will be forced to expend large amounts of capital to remain competitive and maintain optimal hash rates. For example, in 2020 Bitmain released and delivered its S19 model miners to many of our competitors, which, aside from being more efficient because they are newer than our S17 miners, also have the advantage of improved technology and computing power.\nMany of our S17 miners need to be repaired or replaced as a product of ordinary wear and tear and depreciation, or defect and/or competitive forces in the marketplace or other factors rendering our current miners obsolete. Any upgrading we need or choose to undertake requires substantial capital investment, and we may face challenges in locating the requisite capital in a timely manner and/or on terms favorable to us or not highly dilutive to our investors. If we are unable to obtain adequate numbers of new and replacement miners in sufficient quantities or without delay, we may be unable to compete in our highly competitive and continuously developing industry. If this happens, we may not be able to mine Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency as efficiently or in sufficient amounts relative to our competition or at all and, as a result, our business and financial results could suffer which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe loss of our sole executive officer, Robert B. Ladd, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur success is largely dependent on the continued services of Mr. Robert B. Ladd, our President, Chief Executive Officer and acting Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Ladd, including as a result of the SEC Action described in the following risk factor, would leave us without executive leadership, which could diminish our business and growth opportunities. We will also need to build an executive management team around Mr. Ladd, which could be a time consuming and expensive process and divert management\u2019s attention from other pressing matters concerning the Company\u2019s operations or growth. The market for highly qualified personnel in this industry is very competitive and we may be unable to attract such personnel in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to attract such personnel, our business could be harmed. If we fail to procure the services of additional executive management or implement and execute an effective contingency or succession plan for Mr. Ladd, the loss of Mr. Ladd would significantly disrupt our business.\nOther than Mr. Ladd, we have no other officers and only one other director. The loss of Mr. Ladd, would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have key man insurance on the life of Mr. Ladd. Mr. Ladd\u2019s Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement (the \u201cEmployment Agreement\u201d), which was executed on April 6, 2018, and amended on November 11, 2020, permits him to resign for good reason which includes a material breach of the agreement by the Company. In the event he terminates his Employment Agreement for Good Reason, this would result in the Company owing him approximately $510 and would leave the Company without an executive officer which may have a material adverse effect upon us, your investment, and hamper the ability of the Company to continue operations.\nThe SEC has filed an action against the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer alleging violations of federal securities laws which could result in liabilities for the Company.\nOn September 7, 2018, the SEC commenced a legal action, SEC v. Barry C. Honig et al. (the \u201cSEC Action\u201d), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York naming as defendant Mr. Robert B. Ladd, our Chief Executive Officer. An amended complaint in the SEC Action was filed on March 8, 2019. On May 24, 2019, the SEC issued a subpoena in the SEC Action to the Company and on October 31, 2019, the SEC issued subpoenas in the SEC Action to our Chairman and our independent director. The SEC filed a second amended complaint in the SEC Action on March 16, 2020 asserting additional civil charges against Mr. Ladd. The SEC Action asserts civil charges against multiple individuals and entities, including former shareholders of the Company, who are alleged to have violated the securities laws by engaging in \u201cpump and dump\u201d schemes in connection with certain microcap stocks and three entities, including the Company (the Company is not named as a defendant). To the extent the SEC Action pertains to Mr. Ladd in his capacity as an officer of the Company, we are required to indemnify him in his defense of the SEC Action and cannot predict the likelihood or amount of expenses this will entail. Further, the SEC Action has diverted and may continue to divert Mr. Ladd\u2019s attention from his management duties to the Company. If the outcome of this litigation results in the Company losing Mr. Ladd\u2019s services, we may be unable to find a suitable replacement in a reasonable time or without incurring significant costs or experiencing operational disruptions. Further, we cannot predict whether the SEC Action might result in future actions, penalties or other liabilities against the Company, and we may incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any resulting governmental proceedings that may be instituted against the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s directors and officers\u2019 insurance policies have been exhausted and will cause the Company to increase spending on legal expenses.\nUnder its certificate of incorporation and Bylaws, Mr. Ladd\u2019s Employment Agreement, and certain indemnification agreements, the Company has obligations to indemnify current and former directors and certain current and former employees. Based on cumulative legal fees and settlements incurred the Company has fully exhausted its directors and officers insurance coverage. Additional expenses currently expected to be incurred, including in connection with the SEC Action which is still ongoing, and that may occur in the future, or liabilities that may be imposed in connection with actions against certain of the Company\u2019s past and present directors and officers and certain current and former employees who are entitled to indemnification will be funded by the Company with its existing cash resources. Such expenses could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are several new and existing competitors in our industry that are purchasing mining equipment at scale, which may cause delays or difficulty in us obtaining new miners, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMany of the competitors in our industry have also been purchasing mining equipment at scale, which has caused a world-wide shortage of mining equipment and extended the corresponding delivery schedules for new miner purchases. There can be no assurances the mining equipment manufacturers on which we rely such as Bitmain will be able to keep pace with the surge in demand for mining equipment if and when we decide to upgrade and/or expand upon our current miners. Additionally, the supply of the materials used to produce miners, such as the ASIC computer chips that are the primary feature in their computing power, may become subject to shortages, which could also either increase the cost beyond what we can reasonably afford or reduce their availability without unreasonable delay or at all. It is uncertain how manufacturers will respond to these trends and whether they can deliver on the schedules promised to any or all of their customers in the future. In the event Bitmain or other manufacturers are not able to keep pace with demand or avoid supply shortages, we may not be able to purchase miners from Bitmain or other manufacturers in sufficient quantities, at reasonable prices or on the delivery schedules that meet our business needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt national and international commerce and we may not be able to continue our operations as presently conducted, obtain new miners or replacement parts for our existing miners in a timely or cost-effective manner, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe novel strain of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has spread as a global pandemic throughout the world and has resulted in authorities imposing, and businesses and individuals implementing, numerous unprecedented measures to try to contain the virus. Although the United States and countries around the world have been releasing a vaccine, there are no assurances that the vaccine will be effective, and what impact it will have on reducing the spread or containment of COVID-19. In addition to vaccinations, preventative efforts include travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, and shutdowns. These measures may impact our mining operations, the third-party contractors on which we rely to further those operations, and the vendors, suppliers and manufacturers with which we do business. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and its impact on overall global economic and political uncertainty; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; the speed and extent to which vaccines are distributed and their efficacy at preventing the COVID-19 virus from spreading and impacting the general populace, both in the short- and long- term, and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions and on the cryptocurrency industry in particular.\nCurrent and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air and ground transport, port closures or congestion, and increased border controls or closures, can also impact our ability to timely mine Bitcoin in sufficient quantities and/or sell the Bitcoin we receive at favorable prices, and could materially adversely affect us. For example, these added challenges may increase costs or delays in the repair or replacement of certain of our miners which have demonstrated defects. Increased transportation, electrical supply, labor or other costs which may result from the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the effects of COVID-19 are prolonged.\nTo the extent that the profit margins of Bitcoin mining operations are not high, operators of Bitcoin mining operations or other participants in the Bitcoin industry are more likely to immediately sell Bitcoins in the market, thereby constraining growth of the price of Bitcoin that could adversely impact us.\nOver the years, Bitcoin mining operations have shifted from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation ASIC servers to larger enterprises with newer, more \u201cprofessionalized\u201d sources of processing power which has been predominantly added by \u201cprofessionalized\u201d mining operations and resulting demand for more professionalized and powerful miners having faster hash rates. These professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. Acquiring this specialized hardware at scale requires the investment of significant up-front capital, and mine operators incur significant expenses related to the operation of this hardware at scale, such as the leasing of operating space, which is often done in data centers or warehousing facilities, obtaining and paying for an electricity supply to run the miners and employing technicians to operate the mining facilities.\nAs a result, these professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined and regular expenses and liabilities. Because these regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized mining operations to maintain profit margins on the sale of Bitcoin, to the extent the price of Bitcoin declines and such profit margin is constrained, such miners are incentivized to sell Bitcoin earned from mining operations more rapidly than individual miners who in past years were more likely to hold newly mined Bitcoin for longer periods. The immediate selling of newly mined Bitcoin greatly increases the trading volume of Bitcoin, creating downward pressure on the market price of Bitcoin rewards.\nThe extent to which the value of Bitcoin mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such an operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined Bitcoin rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit margin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby potentially depressing Bitcoin prices. Lower Bitcoin prices could result in further tightening of profit margins for professionalized mining operations creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of Bitcoin until mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable forcing them to reduce mining power or cease mining operations temporarily.\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital needed to grow our business.\nWe will likely continue to operate at a loss, at least until our business strategy is implemented, or if Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency prices decline, and we expect to need to raise additional capital to expand our operations and pursue our growth strategies, including potentially the acquisition of new or additional miners, and to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely affect our existing operations. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the per share value of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock on order of liquidation preference. We may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or take other actions including terms that require us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios that could otherwise not be in the interests of our stockholders.\nBecause our miners are designed specifically to mine Bitcoin, our future success will depend in large part upon the value of Bitcoin, and any sustained decline in its value could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur operating results will depend in large part upon the value of Bitcoin because it is the primary cryptocurrency we currently mine. Specifically, our revenues from our Bitcoin mining operations are based upon two factors: (1) the number of Bitcoin rewards we successfully mine and (2) the value of Bitcoin. This means that our operating results will be subject to swings based upon increases or decreases in the value of Bitcoin. Furthermore, our business strategy focuses solely on producing Bitcoin (as opposed to other cryptocurrencies), and our current ASIC miners principally utilize the \u201cSHA-256 algorithm,\u201d which is designed primarily for mining Bitcoin. We therefore, cannot use these miners to mine other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, that are not mined utilizing this algorithm. While the S17 model can mine Bitcoin Cash, we do not currently employ our miners for this purpose. If other cryptocurrencies overtake Bitcoin in terms of acceptance, the value of Bitcoin could decline. Further, if Bitcoin were to switch its proof of work algorithm from SHA-256 to another algorithm for which our miners would not be suited or if the value of Bitcoin were to decline for other reasons, particularly if such decline were significant or over an extended period of time, we would likely incur very significant costs in retooling or replacing our existing miners with miners better suited for this new protocol and our operating results could be adversely affected. This could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations, and thus harm investors.\nBitcoin is subject to Halving, meaning that the Bitcoin rewarded for solving a block will be reduced in the future and its value may not commensurately adjust to compensate us for such reductions, and the overall supply of Bitcoin is finite.\nBitcoin is subject to Halving, which is the process by which the Bitcoin reward for solving a block is reduced by 50% every 210,000 blocks that are solved. This means that the amount of Bitcoin we (or any other miner) are rewarded for solving a block in the Blockchain is permanently cut in half. For example, the latest Halving having occurred in May 2020, with a revised payout of 6.25 Bitcoin per block solved, down from the previous reward rate of 12.5 Bitcoin per block solved. There can be no assurance that the price of Bitcoin will sufficiently increase to justify the increasingly high costs of mining for Bitcoin given the Halving feature. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the trading price of these cryptocurrencies does not follow these anticipated Halving events, the revenue we earn from our mining operations would see a corresponding decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. To illustrate, even if the price of Bitcoin remains at its price as of today, all other factors being equal (including the same number of miners and a stable hash rate) our revenue would decrease substantially upon the next Halving.\nFurther, due to the Halving process, unless the underlying code of the Bitcoin Blockchain is altered (which may be unlikely or difficult given its decentralized nature), the supply of Bitcoin is finite. Once 21 million Bitcoin have been generated by virtue of solving blocks in the Blockchain, the network will stop producing more. Currently, there are approximately 19.0 million Bitcoin in circulation representing about 90% of the total supply of Bitcoin under the current source code. For the foregoing reasons, the Halving feature exposes us to inherent uncertainty and reliance upon the historically volatile price of Bitcoin, rendering an investment in us particularly speculative, especially in the long-term. If the price of Bitcoin does not significantly increase in value, your investment could become worthless.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power and our current Electricity Agreement.\nOur Bitcoin mining operations have required significant amounts of electrical power, and, to the extent we purchase additional miners or acquire new miners which require higher energy inputs, our electricity requirements would grow. If we are unable to continue to obtain sufficient electrical power to operate our miners on a cost-effective basis, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our significant capital investments in new miners. Even at our current energy usage, there can be no guarantee that our operational costs will not increase in the future, as our current Electricity Agreement expired on September 30, 2021. While we are engaged in negotiations for a new contract for electricity with City of Lafayette, Georgia, a municipal corporation of the State of Georgia (\u201cthe City\u201d), there can be no assurance that we can reach an agreement with the City with acceptable price, volume and other terms, if at all. Currently we are in a month-to-month agreement with the City. The City is our only supplier of electricity at our location.\nAdditionally, our mining operations could be materially adversely affected by prolonged power outages, and we may have to reduce or cease our operations in the event of an extended power outage, or as a result of the unavailability or increased cost of electrical power. If this were to occur, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and investors in our securities could be harmed.\nInterruptions to internet access could disrupt our operations, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur cryptocurrency mining operations require access to high-speed internet to be successful. If we lose internet access for a prolonged period, we may be required to reduce our operations or cease them altogether. A disruption of the Internet may affect the use of cryptocurrencies and subsequently the value of our securities. Generally, cryptocurrencies and our business of mining cryptocurrencies is dependent upon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt a currency\u2019s network operations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on the price of Bitcoin and our ability to mine Bitcoin. If this occurs, our business and results of operations may suffer, and our investors may be materially and adversely effected.\nBitcoin has forked three times and additional forks may occur in the future which may affect the value of Bitcoin held or mined by the Company.\nTo the extent that a significant majority of users and miners on a cryptocurrency network install software that changes the cryptocurrency network or properties of a cryptocurrency, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency network would be subject to new protocols and software. However, if less than a significant majority of users and miners on the cryptocurrency network consent to the proposed modification, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a \u201cfork\u201d of the network, with one prong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of the cryptocurrency running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability and necessitating exchange-type transaction to convert currencies between the two forks. Additionally, it may be unclear following a fork which fork represents the original asset and which is the new asset. Different metrics adopted by industry participants to determine which is the original asset include: referring to the wishes of the core developers of a cryptocurrency, Blockchains with the greatest amount of hashing power contributed by miners or validators; or Blockchains with the longest chain. A fork in the network of a particular cryptocurrency could adversely affect an investment in our securities or our ability to operate.\nSince August 1, 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain was forked three times creating Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin SV. The forks resulted in a new Blockchain being created with a shared history, and a new path forward. The value of the newly created Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin SV may or may not have value in the long run and may affect the price of Bitcoin if interest is shifted away from Bitcoin to the newly created digital assets. The value of Bitcoin after the creation of a fork is subject to many factors including the value of the fork product, market reaction to the creation of the fork product, and the occurrence of forks in the future. As such, the value of Bitcoin could be materially reduced if existing and future forks have a negative effect on Bitcoin\u2019s value.\nOur reliance primarily on a single model of miner may subject our operations to increased risk of mine failure.\nThe performance and reliability of our miners and our technology is critical to our operations. Because we currently use mostly S17 miners, if there continue to be issues with those machines, such as a design flaw in the ASIC chips they employ, our entire system could be affected. We recently experienced this issue with our S17 miners, as of the 430 miners we currently own, 350 have defects that render them either unusable or unable to operate at their maximum designed capacity. Additionally, we have sold 923 of our S17 miners and had to scrap 153 S17 miners which lost their value. This results in both lost revenue from inhibited mining operations and increased costs to repair and replace our mining infrastructure. Therefore, any disruption in our ability to continue mining, even with a portion of our total miners, could result in a material reduction to Bitcoin reward yields which would harm our business. Any weakness, flaw, or error which arises with our miners such similar to or more severe and widespread than the problems we experienced with our S17 miners may affect all or a large portion of our miners; therefore, if a defect or other flaw exists, our entire mine could go offline simultaneously. Any such interruption, delay or inability to continue operations could result in financial losses, a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and reputational harm.\nOur mining operations, including the miners, the container, the land and the facility as a whole in which our miners are operated, are subject to real estate risks and potential damage and contingencies for which we are not covered by insurance.\nOur current mining operations are exclusively conducted at our Lafayette, GA facility. This facility is, and any future mines we may establish, will be subject to a variety of risks relating to housing all of our operations, which include expensive revenue generating equipment at a single physical location. We also face risks because we own the land underlying the facility rather than rent, and therefore face risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. While we have insurance covering general liability and property theft and damage, we may be underinsured for some of the risks we face due to our single facility and ownership of the underlying land, including:\n\u25cf the possibility of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage;\n\u25cf any noncompliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, noise, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements;\n\u25cf any damage resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms;\n\u25cf claims by employees and others for injuries sustained at our facility;\n\u25cf theft, arson or other crimes upon our facility;\n\u25cf adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions;\n\u25cf declines in the value of the real estate; and\n\u25cf the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses.\nFor example, our facility could be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of a fire or other natural disaster or by a terrorist or other attack on the facility. The security and other measures we take to protect against these risks may not be sufficient. Additionally, our mine could be materially adversely affected by a power outage or loss of access to the electrical grid or loss by the grid of cost-effective sources of electrical power generating capacity. Given our constant power requirement to operate our miners and generate revenue, it would not be feasible to run miners on back-up power generators in the event of a power outage. We do not carry insurance that would cover losses resulting from any of these events. In the event of an uninsured loss, including a loss in excess of insured limits, at any of the miners in our network, such miners may not be adequately repaired in a timely manner or at all and we may lose some or all of the future revenues which could have otherwise been derived from such miners. Additionally, to the extent the miners, the modified containers in which they are held, or the land itself is permanently damaged, we may not be able to bear the cost of repair or replacement. Should any of these events transpire, we may not be able to recover, could lose a material amount of potential revenue, and our business and results of operations could be materially harmed as a result. Further, we may be unable to replace our fire and theft insurance which exposes us to further risk of loss.\nThe Company\u2019s reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nWe receive Bitcoin mining rewards from our mining activity through a third-party mining pool operator. Mining pools allow miners to combine their processing power, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The rewards are distributed by the pool operator, proportionally to our contribution to the pool\u2019s overall mining power, used to generate each block. Should the pool operator\u2019s system suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack, software malfunction or other similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue. Furthermore, we are dependent on the accuracy of the mining pool operator\u2019s record keeping to accurately record the total processing power provided to the pool for a given Bitcoin mining application in order to assess the proportion of that total processing power we provided. We would have limited means of recourse against the mining pool operator if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect, other than leaving the pool. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our mining pool operators, we may experience reduced reward for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThere is a possibility of cryptocurrency mining algorithms transitioning to proof of stake validation and other mining related risks, which could make us less competitive and ultimately adversely affect our business and the value of our stock.\nProof of stake is an alternative method in validating cryptocurrency transactions that is less dependent on the consumption of electricity. Should the algorithm shift from a proof of work validation method to a proof of stake method, mining would likely require less energy, which may render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from lower priced electricity, processing, real estate, or hosting) less competitive. We, as a result of our efforts to optimize and improve the efficiency of our Bitcoin mining operations, may be exposed to the risk in the future of losing the relative competitive advantage we may have over some of our competitors as a result, and may be negatively impacted if a switch to proof of stake validation were to occur. This is because we have invested heavily in setting up our facility based on the mining algorithms method of validation. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or results of operations, the value of Bitcoin.\nWe may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe may be subject to legal claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Due to the open-source and constantly evolving nature of our business, we may not always be able to determine that we are using or accessing protected information or software. For example, there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our activities or the equipment or software we use may infringe. The ready availability of damages, royalties and the potential for injunctive relief has increased the defense litigation costs of patent infringement claims, especially those asserted by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. Such claims, even if not meritorious, may result in significant expenditure of financial and managerial resources, and the payment of damages or settlement amounts. Additionally, we may become subject to injunctions prohibiting us from using software or business processes we currently use or may need to use in the future or requiring us to obtain licenses from third parties when such licenses may not be available on financially feasible terms or terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Bitcoin\nThe trading price of shares of our common stock may increase or decrease as does the trading price of Bitcoin, which subject investors to pricing risks, including \u201cbubble\u201d type risks, and volatility.\nBecause of our dependence on Bitcoin, the trading prices of our common stock may at times be tied to the trading prices of Bitcoin. Specifically, we may experience adverse effects on our stock price when the value of Bitcoin drops. Furthermore, if the market for Bitcoin company stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to arbitrary pricing factors that are not necessarily associated with traditional factors that influence stock prices or the value of non-cryptocurrency assets such as revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth prospects or business activity since the value and price, as determined by the investing public, may be influenced by uncertain contingencies such as future anticipated adoption or appreciation in value of cryptocurrencies or Blockchains generally, and other factors over which we have little or no influence or control.\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrency market prices, which have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed below), are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. Furthermore, such prices may be subject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, or our share price, making their market prices more volatile or creating \u201cbubble\u201d type risks for the trading price of Bitcoin.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the trading price of Bitcoin has appreciated significantly, from a low closing value of approximately $30 per Bitcoin in January 2021, to a high closing value of approximately $68 per Bitcoin in November 2021, before closing the year at $46. There can be no assurances that similar volatility in the trading price of Bitcoin will not occur in the future. Accordingly, since the trading price of our securities may at times be connected to the trading price of Bitcoin, if the trading price of Bitcoin again experiences a significant decline, we could experience a similar decline in the trading price for shares of our common stock. If this occurs, you may not be able to sell the shares of our common stock which you purchased at or above the price you paid for them or at all.\nThe markets for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the existing markets may be under regulated and, as a result, the market price of Bitcoin may be subject to significant volatility or manipulation, which could decrease consumer confidence in cryptocurrencies and have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCryptocurrencies that are represented and trade on a ledger-based platform and those who hold them may not enjoy the same benefits as traditional securities available on trading markets and their investors. Stock exchanges have listing requirements and vet issuers, requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules, and monitor investors transacting on such platforms for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated on a distributed ledger platform, depending on the platform\u2019s controls and other policies. The more lax a distributed ledger platform is about vetting issuers of cryptocurrency assets or users that transact on the platform, the higher the potential risk for fraud or the manipulation of the ledger due to a control event.\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrency market prices have historically been volatile, are impacted by a variety of factors, and are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. Furthermore, such prices may be subject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, or our share price, making their market prices more volatile or creating \u201cbubble\u201d type risks for both Bitcoin and shares of our common stock.\nThese factors may inhibit consumer trust in and market acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire.\nThe development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\nThe use of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly evolving industry that employs cryptocurrency assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Large-scale acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment has not, and may never, occur. The growth of this industry in general, and the use of Bitcoin in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of developing protocols may occur unpredictably. The factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf the progress of worldwide growth in the adoption and use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange;\u2009\n\u25cf governmental and organizational regulation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the network or similar cryptocurrency systems;\n\u25cf changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences, including as may result from coverage of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies by journalists and other sources of information and media;\n\u25cf the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the network;\u2009\u2009\n\u25cf the increased consolidation of contributors to the Bitcoin Blockchain through mining pools and scaling of mining equipment by well-capitalized market participants;\n\u25cf the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;\u2009\u2009\n\u25cf the use of the networks supporting Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for developing smart contracts and distributed applications;\u2009\u2009\n\u25cf general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; and\u2009\u2009\n\u25cf the impact of regulators focusing on cryptocurrencies and the costs associated with such regulatory oversight.\n\u2009\nA decline in the popularity or acceptance of the Bitcoin network could adversely affect an investment in us.\nThe outcome of these factors could have negative effects on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as potentially negative effects on the value of any Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire, which would harm investors in our securities.\nCurrently, there is relatively small use of Bitcoins in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively large use by speculators, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect an investment in us.\nAs relatively new products and technologies, Bitcoins and the Bitcoin network have only recently become widely accepted as a means of payment for goods and services by many major retail and commercial outlets, and use of Bitcoins by consumers to pay such retail and commercial outlets remains limited. Conversely, a significant portion of Bitcoin demand is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of Bitcoins. A lack of expansion by Bitcoins into retail and commercial markets, or a contraction of such use, may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the price of Bitcoin, either of which could adversely impact an investment in us.\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities.\nA number of companies that engage in Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions in response to government action, particularly in China, where regulatory response to cryptocurrencies has been to exclude their use for ordinary consumer transactions within China. Specifically, in May 2021 the Chinese government banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The price of Bitcoin has declined dramatically beginning in May 2021 in response to this trend. The difficulty that many businesses that provide Bitcoin and/or derivatives on other cryptocurrency-related activities have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services may be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and harming public perception of cryptocurrencies, and could decrease their usefulness and harm their public perception in the future.\nThe usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and the public perception of cryptocurrencies could be damaged if banks or financial institutions were to close the accounts of businesses engaging in Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities. This could occur as a result of compliance risk, cost, government regulation or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock and derivatives on commodities exchanges, the over-the-counter market, and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities adopts or implements similar policies, rules or regulations, could negatively affect our relationships with financial institutions and impede our ability to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to monetize our mining efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and harm investors.\nPolitical or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of cryptocurrencies, which could result in a reduction in values of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and adversely affect an investment in us.\nGeopolitical crises may motivate large-scale sales of cryptocurrencies, which could rapidly decrease the price of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Alternatively, as an emerging asset class with limited acceptance as a payment system or commodity, global crises and general economic downturn may discourage investment in cryptocurrencies as investors focus their investment on less volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risk.\nAs an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of buying and selling goods and services, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events. Nevertheless, political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrencies either globally or locally. Large-scale sales of cryptocurrencies would result in a reduction in digital asset values and could adversely affect an investment in us.\nThe decentralized nature of cryptocurrency systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\nThe decentralized nature of the governance of cryptocurrency systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a network from overcoming emergent obstacles. Governance of many cryptocurrency systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear leadership structure or authority. To the extent lack of clarity in corporate governance of cryptocurrency systems leads to ineffective decision making that slows development and growth of such cryptocurrencies, the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use digital assets in one or more countries, and ownership of, holding or trading in our securities may also be considered illegal and subject to sanction.\nAs digital assets have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to digital assets; certain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact our ability to continue to operate, and such actions could affect our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nThe emergence of competing Blockchain platforms or technologies may harm our business as presently conducted.\nIf Blockchain platforms or technologies which compete with Bitcoin and its Blockchain, including competing cryptocurrencies which our miners may not be able to mine, such as cryptocurrencies being developed or may be developed by popular social media platforms, online retailers, or government sponsored cryptocurrencies, consumers may use such alternative platforms or technologies. If that were to occur, we would face difficulty adapting to emergent such digital ledgers, Blockchains, or alternative platforms or digital assets. This may adversely affect us by preventing us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments and forcing us to expend additional capital in an effort to adapt. Further, to the extent we cannot adapt, be it due to our specialized miners or otherwise, we could be forced to cease operations. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our business, and in turn investors\u2019 investments in our securities.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the volume of transactions may not be effective. Therefore, scaling cryptocurrencies will be essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, which widespread acceptance is necessary to the continued growth and development of our business. Many cryptocurrency networks face significant scaling challenges, such as limitations on how many transactions can occur per second. There can be no guarantee that any of the systems in place or being considered to increasing the scale of settlement of cryptocurrency transactions will be effective, or how long they will take to become effective, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.\nThe price of cryptocurrencies may be affected by the sale of such cryptocurrencies by other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking cryptocurrency markets.\nThe global market for cryptocurrency is characterized by supply constraints that differ from those present in the markets for commodities or other assets such as gold and silver. The mathematical protocols under which certain cryptocurrencies are mined permit the creation of a limited, predetermined amount of digital currency, while others have no limit established on total supply. Increased numbers of miners and deployed mining power globally will likely continue to increase the available supply of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which may depress their market price. Further, large \u201cblock sales\u201d involving significant numbers of Bitcoin following appreciation in the market price of Bitcoin may also increase the supply of Bitcoin available on the market, which, without a corresponding increase in demand, may cause its price to fall. Additionally, to the extent that other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking cryptocurrency markets form and come to represent a significant proportion of the demand for cryptocurrencies, large redemptions of the securities of those vehicles and the subsequent sale of cryptocurrencies by such vehicles could negatively affect cryptocurrency prices and therefore affect the value of the cryptocurrency inventory we hold. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine.\nThe Bitcoin we mine may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access.\nThere is a risk that some or all of the Bitcoin we mine could be lost or stolen. In general, cryptocurrencies are stored in cryptocurrency sites commonly referred to as \u201cwallets\u201d by holders of cryptocurrencies which may be accessed to exchange a holder\u2019s cryptocurrency assets. Access to our Bitcoin could also be restricted by cybercrime (such as a denial of service attack). While we take steps to attempt to secure the Bitcoin we hold, there can be no assurance our efforts to protect our digital assets will be successful.\nHackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure cryptocurrencies, such as by attacking the cryptocurrency network source code, exchange miners, third-party platforms, cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our ability to generate revenue and become profitable. The loss or destruction of a private key required to access our digital wallets may be irreversible and we may be denied access for all time to our Bitcoin holdings. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss relating to our digital wallets could adversely affect our business.\nCryptocurrencies are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which they are held, which wallet\u2019s public key or address is reflected in the network\u2019s public Blockchain. We are required to publish the public key relating to digital wallets in use when we verify the receipt of transfers and disseminate such information into the network, but we will need to safeguard the private keys relating to such digital wallets. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our Bitcoin rewards and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our mined Bitcoin could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to continue as a going concern, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any Bitcoin we mine.\nIncorrect or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions may be irreversible.\nCryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions, such as a result of a cybersecurity breach against our Bitcoin holdings, could adversely affect our investments and assets. This is because cryptocurrency transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the cryptocurrencies from the transaction. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to a Blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a cryptocurrency or a theft thereof generally will not be reversible and we may not have sufficient recourse to recover our losses from any such transfer or theft. Further, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, our cryptocurrency rewards could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts. If an errant or fraudulent transaction in our Bitcoin were to occur, we would have very limited means of seeking to reverse the transaction or seek recourse. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity threats to us could result in a loss of Company\u2019s Bitcoin holdings.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in the Bitcoin exchange market since the launch of the Bitcoin network. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses, could harm our business operations or result in loss of our Bitcoin and lost revenue. Furthermore we believe that to the extent we hold greater amounts of Bitcoin, we may become a more appealing target for security threats such as hackers and malware.\nThe security system and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee of ours, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our, private keys, data or Bitcoins. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of ours to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security system occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security system could be harmed, which could adversely affect an investment in us. In the event of a security breach, we may be forced to cease operations, or suffer a reduction in our digital assets, the occurrence of each of which could adversely affect an investment in us.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on a cryptocurrency network, such actor or botnet could manipulate Blockchains to adversely affect us, which would adversely affect an investment in us or our ability to operate.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining a cryptocurrency, it may be able to alter Blockchains on which transactions of cryptocurrency reside and rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new units or transactions using such control. The malicious actor could \u201cdouble-spend\u201d its own cryptocurrency (i.e., spend the same Bitcoin in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users\u2019 transactions for as long as it maintained control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its control of the processing power on the network or the cryptocurrency community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to Blockchains may not be possible. The foregoing description is not the only means by which the entirety of Blockchains or cryptocurrencies may be compromised but is only an example.\nAlthough there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of Blockchains achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing power on the network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded the 50% threshold in Bitcoin. The possible crossing of the 50% threshold indicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of Bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the Bitcoin community, and the administrators of mining pools, do not act to ensure greater decentralization of Bitcoin mining processing power, the feasibility of a botnet or malicious actor obtaining control of the Blockchain\u2019s processing power will increase, because such botnet or malicious actor could more readily infiltrate and seize control over the Blockchain by compromising a single mining pool, if the mining pool compromises more than 50% of the mining power on the Blockchain, than it could if the mining pool had a smaller share of the Blockchain\u2019s total hashing power. Conversely, if the Blockchain remains decentralized it is inherently more difficult for the botnet or malicious actor to aggregate enough processing power to gain control of the Blockchain. If this were to occur, the public may lose confidence in the Bitcoin Blockchain, and Blockchain technology more generally. This would likely have a material and adverse effect on the price of Bitcoin, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations, and harm investors.\nIf the Bitcoin rewards for solving blocks are not sufficiently high, miners may not have adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations, which may make the Blockchains they support with their mining activity less stable.\nAs the number of cryptocurrency rewards awarded for solving a block in a Blockchain decreases, the relative cost of producing a single cryptocurrency will also increase, unless there is a corresponding increase in demand for that cryptocurrency. Even relatively stable demand may not be sufficient to support the costs of mining, because as new miners begin working to solve blocks, the relative amount of energy expended to obtain a cryptocurrency award will tend to increase. This increased energy directly relates to an increased cost of mining, which means an increased cost of obtaining a cryptocurrency award. This increased cost, if not met with a corresponding increase in the market price for the cryptocurrency resulting from increased scarcity and demand, may lead miners, such as us, to conclude they do not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and, therefore, may cease their mining operations. This could in turn reduce the sustainability of the Bitcoin Blockchain, which is dependent upon continued mining to solve the block\u2019s algorithms and process transactions in Bitcoin. If this were to occur, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations.\nCryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\nAs with any computer code generally, flaws in cryptocurrency codes may be exposed by malicious actors. Several errors and defects have been found previously, including those that disabled some functionality for users and exposed users\u2019 information. Exploitations of flaws in the source code that allow malicious actors to take or create money have previously occurred. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our miners, computer systems and those of third parties that we use in our operations, are vulnerable to cyber security risks, including cyber-attacks such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our miners and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine.\nWe have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.\nAs cryptocurrency assets and Blockchain technologies become more widely available, we expect the services and products associated with them to evolve. In order to stay current with the industry, our business model may need to evolve as well. From time to time, we may modify aspects of our business model relating to our strategy. We cannot offer any assurance that these or any other modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to our business. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. Further, we cannot provide any assurance that we will successfully identify all emerging trends and growth opportunities in this business sector and we may lose out on those opportunities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nSince there has been limited precedence set for financial accounting of digital assets, it is unclear how we will be required to account for Bitcoin transactions in the future.\nSince there has been limited precedence set for the financial accounting of digital assets such as Bitcoin, it is unclear how we will be required to account for Bitcoin transactions or holdings. Furthermore, a change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the necessity to restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects or operations.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies; certain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade with no or minimal restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., cryptocurrencies are subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Ongoing and future regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nBecause cryptocurrencies may be determined to be investment securities, we may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 and be subject to comprehensive regulatory requirements that we would likely be unable to afford.\nWhile we do not believe that we are primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, nor do we hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities, we may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) based on our Bitcoin holdings. Under the 1940 Act, an entity may be deemed to be an investment company if the value of its investment securities is more than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nAs a result of our Bitcoin holdings resulting from our mining activities, to the extent Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency we may hold is determined by the SEC or a state legislator to be a security, our holdings could exceed 40% of our total assets such that we may trigger the threshold described above and become an inadvertent investment company unless we can rely an applicable exemption.\nClassification as an investment company under the 1940 Act requires registration with the SEC. Such registration is time consuming, expensive and restrictive and would require a substantial and onerous restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company. Further, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the 1940 Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in the Company incurring substantial additional expenses, and such costs or the failure to register if required would have a materially adverse impact on our operations.\nCurrent interpretations require the regulation of Bitcoin under the CEA by the CFTC, and we may be required to register and comply with such regulations. Any disruption of our operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to investors.\nCurrent and future legislation, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, derivatives on these assets are not excluded from the definition of \u201ccommodity future\u201d by the CFTC. We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under the law.\nBitcoins have been deemed to fall within the definition of a commodity and, we may be required to register and comply with additional regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d), including additional periodic report and disclosure standards and requirements. Moreover, we may be required to register as a commodity pool operator and to register us as a commodity pool with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in us. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in us.\nOur interactions with a Blockchain may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distributed ledger technology.\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its specially designated nationals (\u201cSDN\u201d) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of Blockchain transactions we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC\u2019s SDN list. Our Company\u2019s policy prohibits any transactions with such SDN individuals, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we transact with respect to selling cryptocurrency assets. Moreover, federal law prohibits any U.S. person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual depiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have imbedded such depictions on one or more Blockchains. Because our business requires us to download and retain one or more Blockchains to effectuate our ongoing business, it is possible that such digital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without our knowledge or consent. To the extent government enforcement authorities literally enforce these and other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger technology, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which could harm our reputation and affect the value of our common stock.\nGovernmental action against the Blockchain and Bitcoin mining may have a materially adverse effect on the industry, and could affect us if widely adopted.\nWe could become subject to regulations aimed at preventing what are perceived as some of the negative attributes of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining. For example, China has already made transacting in cryptocurrencies illegal for Chinese citizens in mainland China, and additional restrictions may follow. Further, on March 2, 2021, governmental authorities of the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia, began to take action to impose an outright ban on Bitcoin mining in the province due to the industry\u2019s high electrical consumption demands and negative environmental impacts. This could demonstrate the beginning of a regulatory trend in response to concerns of overconsumption as it relates to environmental impact and energy conservation, and similar action in a jurisdiction in which we operate could have devastating effects to our operations. If further regulation follows, it is possible that our industry may not be able to adjust to a sudden and dramatic overhaul to our ability to deploy energy towards the operation of mining equipment.\nBecause we are unable to influence or predict future regulatory actions taken by governments, we may face difficulty monitoring and responding to rapid regulatory developments affecting Bitcoin mining, which may have a materially adverse effect on our industry and, therefore, our business and results of operations. If further regulatory action is taken by governments in the United States or elsewhere, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and other federal securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d).\nThe costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to shareholders will cause our expenses to be higher than they would have been if we were privately held. It may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop, implement and maintain the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures.\nPublic company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, we expect these rules and regulations to increase our compliance costs and make certain activities more time consuming and costly. The impact of the SEC\u2019s July 25, 2017 report on Digital Securities (the \u201cDAO Report\u201d) as well as enforcement actions will increase our compliance and legal costs. As a public company, we also expect that these rules and regulations will make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers, and to maintain insurance at reasonable rates, or at all.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf changes in our industry including changes which adversely affect Bitcoin;\n\u25cf the continued volatility of the price of Bitcoin;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u25cf progress and publications of the commercial acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel including our executive officers;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf any public announcement of entering into new agreements and terms thereof, including with respect to the purchase of miners and contracts for the supply of electricity to our facility;\n\u25cf conversion of our convertible notes and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock;\n\u25cf business disruptions caused by earthquakes, tornadoes or other natural disasters;\u2009\u2009\n\u25cf our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u25cf loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u25cf adverse regulatory developments; and\n\u25cf economic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares at a desired price.\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nBecause our common stock does not trade on a national securities exchange, the prices of our common stock may be more volatile and lower than if we were listed.\nOur common stock trades on the OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. This market is not a national securities exchange. While our common stock trading has been relatively active, generally the OTCQB does not have the same level of activity as a national securities exchange like Nasdaq. Most institutions will not purchase a security unless it is on a national securities exchange. In addition, they do not purchase stocks that trade below $5.00 per share. We may, in the future, take certain steps, including utilizing investor awareness campaigns, press releases, road shows and conferences to increase awareness of our business and any steps that we might take to bring us to the awareness of investors may require we compensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on our trading volume. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business and trading may be at an inflated price relative to the performance of our company due to, among other things, availability of sellers of our shares.\nOur common stock is deemed a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which makes it more difficult for our investors to sell their shares.\nOur common stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules adopted under Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). The penny stock rules generally apply to companies whose common stock trades at less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exceptions. Such exceptions include among others any equity security listed on a national securities exchange and any equity security issued by an issuer that has (i) net tangible assets of at least $2,000, if such issuer has been in continuous operation for three years, (ii) net tangible assets of at least $5,000, if such issuer has been in continuous operation for less than three years, or (iii) average annual revenue of at least $6,000 for the last three years. The \u201cpenny stock\u201d designation requires any broker-dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules limit the ability of broker-dealers to solicit purchases of our common stock and therefore reduce its liquidity.\nMoreover, as a result of apparent regulatory pressure from the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a growing number of broker-dealers decline to permit investors, or otherwise make it difficult, to purchase and sell \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d The \u201cpenny stock\u201d designation may have a depressive effect upon our common stock price. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our securities. Because our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows for our board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our shareholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, provide holders of the preferred anti-dilution protection, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing shareholders.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock by us or by our existing shareholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nAdditional equity financings or other share issuances by us, including shares issued in connection with strategic alliances and corporate partnering transactions, and shares issued on the conversion of outstanding notes, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that additional sales could occur could cause the market price of our common stock to drop.\nFor these reasons and others, an investment in our securities is risky and you should invest only if you can withstand a total loss of, and wide fluctuations in, the value of your investment.", "PERMNO": 91050, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "MGTI"}
