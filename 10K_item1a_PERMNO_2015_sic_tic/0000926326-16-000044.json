RISK FACTORS\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe acquisition of Aesynt could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOn January 5, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Aesynt (the \"Aesynt Acquisition\"), a provider of automated medication management systems, including dispensing robots with storage solutions, medication storage and dispensing carts and cabinets, I.V. sterile preparation robotics and software, including software related to medication management. Uncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on employees, customers, distributors, partners and suppliers may have an adverse effect on the combined company. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers, distributors, suppliers, partners and others with whom we do business to seek to change existing business relationships. Any such change may materially and adversely affect our business. Any disruption in our operations could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, distributors, partners, suppliers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nAesynt\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Aesynt Acquisition.\nParties with which Aesynt currently conducts business or may conduct business in the future, including customers and suppliers, may experience uncertainty associated with the Aesynt acquisition, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us or Aesynt. As a result, Aesynt\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruptions if customers, suppliers and others attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us or Aesynt. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects following the closing.\nLoss of key personnel could impair the integration of the two businesses, lead to loss of customers and a decline in revenues, or otherwise adversely affect our operations and the operations of Aesynt.\nOur success after the completion of the Aesynt Acquisition depends, in part, upon our ability to retain key employees, especially during the integration phase of the two businesses. Current and prospective employees of ours and Aesynt might experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the Aesynt Acquisition, which might adversely affect our ability to retain key managers and other employees. In addition, competition for qualified personnel in the health care industry is very intense. If we or Aesynt lose key personnel or we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified individuals or the associated costs to us increase significantly, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our existing business, including those of Aeysnt, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nAs a part of our business strategy we may seek to acquire businesses, technologies or products in the future. For example, in August 2014, we acquired Surgichem Limited, in April 2015, we acquired Mach4 and the entire remaining issued share capital of Avantec not previously owned by us and, on January 5, 2016, we acquired Aesynt. We cannot provide assurance that any acquisition or any future transaction we complete will result in long-term benefits to us or our stockholders, or that our management will be able to integrate or manage the acquired business effectively. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including difficulties associated with the integration of operations, technologies, products and personnel that, if realized, could harm our operating results. Risks related to potential acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit and the complexity of managing a more dispersed organization as sites are acquired;\n\u2022\ncomplying with international labor laws that may restrict our ability to right-size organizations and gain synergies across acquired operations;\n\u2022\ncomplying with regulatory requirements, such as those of the Food and Drug Administration, that we were not previously subject to;\n\u2022\nthe substantial costs that may be incurred and the substantial diversion of management's attention from day-to-day business when evaluating and negotiating such transactions and then integrating an acquired business;\n\u2022\ndiscovery, after completion of the acquisition, of liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets acquired that are broader in scope and magnitude or are more difficult to manage than originally assumed;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties related to assimilating the products or key personnel of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nfailure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited previous experience; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating newly acquired products and solutions into a logical offering that our customers understand and embrace.\nSuccessful integration of acquired operations, products and personnel into Omnicell may place a significant burden on the combined company's management and internal resources. We may also experience difficulty in effectively integrating the different cultures and practices of any acquired entity. The challenges of integrating acquired entities could disrupt the combined company's ongoing business, distract its management focus from other opportunities and challenges, and increase expenses and working capital requirements. The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may fail to realize the potential benefits of the acquisition of Aesynt.\nWe acquired Aesynt in an effort to realize certain potential benefits, including expansion of the combined businesses and broader market opportunities. However, our ability to realize these potential benefits depends on our successfully combining the businesses of Omnicell and Aesynt. The combined company may fail to realize the potential benefits of the acquisition for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\ninability or failure to expand bookings and sales;\n\u2022\ninability or failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts to communicate the capabilities of the combined company;\n\u2022\ninability or failure to successfully integrate and harmonize financial reporting and information technology systems;\n\u2022\ninability or failure to achieve the expected operational and cost efficiencies; and\n\u2022\nloss of key employees.\nThe actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses or delays. If we are not able to successfully integrate Aesynt's business and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe have incurred substantial debt, which could impair our flexibility and access to capital and adversely affect our financial position.\nIn connection with the Aesynt Acquisition, we entered into a $400.0 million senior secured credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement, by and among us, the lenders from time to time party thereto, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $200.0 term loan facility and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility. At the closing of the Aesynt Acquisition, we incurred $255.0 million in secured debt under the Credit Agreement, consisting of $200.0 million of term loans and $55.0 million of revolving loans. Our debt may:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient funds to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or restructure all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell securities, none of which we can assure you that we would be able to do in a timely manner, or at all.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement includes customary restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that could be in our best interests. These restrictive covenants include operating covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, effect certain acquisitions or make other fundamental changes. The Credit Agreement also includes financial covenants requiring us not to exceed a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio of 3.00:1 (subject to certain exceptions) and to maintain a minimum\nfixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50:1. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants that are included in the Credit Agreement could result in a default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, which could permit the lenders to declare all or part of any outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable, or to refuse to permit additional borrowings under the revolving loan facility, which could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions to take advantage of certain business opportunities that may be presented to us. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, the administrative agent and the lenders under the Credit Agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt, which would seriously harm our business.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets that we record in connection with the Aesynt Acquisition, or have recorded in connection with prior acquisitions, become impaired, we could be required to take significant charges against earnings.\nIn connection with the accounting for the Aesynt Acquisition, it is expected that we will record a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, and we maintain significant goodwill and other intangible assets relating to prior acquisitions, such as our acquisition of MTS. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets has been impaired. Amortizing intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity in future periods.\nUnfavorable economic and market conditions, a decreased demand in the capital equipment market and uncertainty regarding the rollout of government legislation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our operating results.\nCustomer demand for our products is significantly linked to the strength of the economy. If decreases in demand for capital equipment caused by weak economic conditions and decreased corporate and government spending, including any effects of fiscal budget balancing at the federal level, deferrals or delays of capital equipment projects, longer time frames for capital equipment purchasing decisions or generally reduced expenditures for capital solutions occurs, we will experience decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, as the U.S. Federal government implements healthcare reform legislation, and as Congress, regulatory agencies and other state governing organizations continue to review and assess additional healthcare legislation and regulations, there may be an impact on our business. Healthcare facilities may decide to postpone or reduce spending until the implications of such healthcare enactments are more clearly understood, which may affect the demand for our products and harm our business.\nThe medication management and supply chain solutions market is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies with greater resources and/or existing business relationships with our current and potential customers.\nThe medication management and supply chain solutions market is intensely competitive. We expect continued and increased competition from current and future competitors, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Our current direct competitors in the medication management and supply chain solutions market include Becton Dickinson/CareFusion Corporation, ARxIUM (through its acquisition of MedSelect, Inc. and Automed), Cerner Corporation, Talyst, Inc., Emerson Electronic Co. (through its acquisition of medDispense, L.P.), Swisslog Holding AG (which was acquired by KUKA), WaveMark Inc., ParExcellence Systems, Inc., Vanas N.V., Infor (formally Lawson Software, Inc.), Willach Pharmacy Solutions, DIH Technologies Co., Yuyama Co., Ltd, Robopharma B.V., Apostore GmbH, KlS Steuerungstechnik GmbH and Suzhou Iron Technology (China). Our current direct competitors in the medication packaging solutions market include Drug Package, Inc., AutoMed Technologies, Inc. (a subsidiary of now part of ARxIUM), Manchac Technologies, LLC (through its Dosis product line) and RX Systems, Inc. in the United States, and Jones Packaging Ltd., Synergy Medical Systems, Manrex Ltd, Global Factories and WebsterCare outside the United States.\nThe competitive challenges we face in the medication management and supply chain solutions market include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ncertain competitors may offer or have the ability to offer a broader range of solutions in the marketplace that we are unable to match;\n\u2022\ncertain competitors may develop alternative solutions to the customer problems our products are designed to solve that may provide a better customer outcome or a lower cost of operation;\n\u2022\ncertain competitors may develop new features or capabilities for their products not previously offered that could compete directly with our products;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures could result in increased price competition for our products and services, fewer customer orders and reduced gross margins, any of which could harm our business;\n\u2022\ncurrent and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including larger, more established healthcare supply companies, such as the acquisition of CareFusion Corporation by Becton Dickenson Corporation, thereby increasing their ability to develop and offer a broader suite of products and services to address the needs of our prospective customers;\n\u2022\nour competitive environment is currently experiencing a significant degree of consolidation which could lead to competitors developing new business models that require us to adapt how we market, sell or distribute our products;\n\u2022\nother established or emerging companies may enter the medication management and supply chain solutions market with products and services that are preferred by our current and potential customers based on factors such as features, capabilities or cost;\n\u2022\nour competitors may develop, license or incorporate new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we do;\n\u2022\ncertain competitors have greater brand name recognition and a more extensive installed base of medication and supply dispensing systems or other products and services than we do, and such advantages could be used to increase their market share;\n\u2022\ncertain competitors may have existing business relationships with our current and potential customers, which may cause these customers to purchase medication and supply dispensing systems or automation solutions from these competitors; and\n\u2022\nour competitors may secure products and services from suppliers on more favorable terms or secure exclusive arrangements with suppliers or buyers that may impede the sales of our products and services.\nAny reduction in the demand for or adoption of our medication and supply systems, related services, or consumables would reduce our revenues.\nOur medication and supply dispensing systems represent only one approach to managing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and supplies at acute healthcare facilities and our medication packaging systems represent only one way of managing medication distribution at non-acute care facilities. While a significant portion of domestic acute care facilities have adopted some level of medication and/or supply automation, a significant portion of domestic and international healthcare facilities still use traditional approaches in some form that do not include fully automated methods of medication and supply management. As a result, we must continuously educate existing and prospective customers about the advantages of our products, which requires significant sales efforts, particularly when we are seeking to replace an incumbent supplier of medication and supply automation solutions and can cause longer sales cycles. Despite our significant efforts and extensive time commitments in sales to healthcare facilities, we cannot be assured that our efforts will result in sales to these customers.\nIn addition, our medication and supply dispensing systems and our more complex automated packaging systems typically represent a sizable initial capital expenditure for healthcare organizations. Changes in the budgets of these organizations and the timing of spending under these budgets can have a significant effect on the demand for our medication and supply dispensing systems and related services. These budgets are often supported by cash flows that can be negatively affected by declining investment income and influenced by limited resources, increased operational and financing costs, macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment rates and conflicting spending priorities among different departments. Any decrease in expenditures by healthcare facilities or increased financing costs could decrease demand for our medication and supply dispensing systems and related services and reduce our revenues.\nChanging customer requirements could decrease the demand for our products and services and our new product solutions may not achieve market acceptance.\nThe medication management and supply chain solutions market is characterized by evolving technologies and industry standards, frequent new product introductions and dynamic customer requirements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive. The medication management and supply chain solutions market could erode rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products, as well as the pricing models for such products. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing customer requirements. The process of developing products and services such as those we offer is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly more complex and expensive in the future as new technologies are introduced. If we are unable to enhance our existing products or develop new products to meet changing\ncustomer requirements, and bring such enhancements and products to market in a timely manner, demand for our products could decrease.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in marketing any new products or services that we introduce, that new products or services will compete effectively with similar products or services sold by our competitors, or that the level of market acceptance of such products or services will be sufficient to generate expected revenues and synergies with our other products or services. Deployment of new products or services often requires interoperability with other Omnicell products or services as well as with healthcare facilities' existing information management systems. If these products or services fail to satisfy these demanding technological objectives, our customers may be dissatisfied and we may be unable to generate future sales.\nThe healthcare industry faces financial constraints and consolidation that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services.\nThe healthcare industry has faced, and will likely continue to face, significant financial constraints. U.S. government legislation such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, the Budget Control Act of 2011, and other health reform legislation may cause customers to postpone purchases of our products due to reductions in federal healthcare program reimbursement rates and/or needed changes to their operations in order to meet the requirements of legislation. Our automation solutions often involve a significant financial commitment from our customers and, as a result, our ability to grow our business is largely dependent on our customers' capital and operating budgets. To the extent legislation promotes spending on other initiatives or healthcare providers spending declines or increases more slowly than we anticipate, demand for our products and services could decline.\nMany healthcare providers have consolidated to create larger healthcare delivery organizations in order to achieve greater market power. If this consolidation continues, it would increase the size of certain target customers, which could increase the cost, effort and difficulty in selling our products to such target customers, or could cause our existing customers or potential new customers to begin utilizing our competitors' products if such customers are acquired by healthcare providers that prefer our competitors' products to ours. In addition, the resulting organizations could have greater bargaining power, which may lead to price erosion.\nDemand for our consumable medication packages is time-sensitive and if we are not able to supply the demand from our institutional and retail pharmacy customers on schedule and with quality packaging products, they may use alternative means to distribute medications to their customers.\nApproximately 17% of our revenue is generated from the sale of consumable medication packages, which are produced in our St. Petersburg, Florida facilities on a continuous basis and shipped to our institutional pharmacy and retail pharmacy customers shortly before they are required by those customers. The demands placed on institutional pharmacies and retail pharmacies by their customers represent real time requirements of those customers. Our customer agreements for the sale of consumable medication packages are typically short-term in nature and typically do not include any volume commitments on the part of the customer. Although our packaging may be considered the preferred method of maintaining control of medications during the medication distribution and administration process, institutional and retail pharmacies have alternative methods of distributing medications, including bulk and alternative packaging, and medication adherence packaging may be supplied by our competitors. To the extent that we are unable to supply quality packaging to our customers in a timely manner, that demand will be met via alternative distribution methods, including consumable medication packaging sold by our competitors, and our revenue will decline. Any disruption in the production capabilities of our St. Petersburg facilities will adversely affect our ability to ship our consumable medication packages and would reduce our revenue.\nOur international operations may subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.\nWe currently have operations outside of the United States, including sales efforts centered in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions and supply chain efforts in Asia. We intend to continue to expand our international operations, particularly in certain markets that we view as strategic, including China and the Middle East. Our international operations subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\nour reliance on distributors for the sale and post-sale support of our automated dispensing systems outside the United States and Canada;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of managing an organization operating in various countries;\n\u2022\npolitical sentiment against international outsourcing of production;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights, particularly in jurisdictions that have less developed intellectual property regimes;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe requirement to comply with a variety of international laws and regulations, including privacy, labor, import, export, environmental standards, tax, anti-bribery and employment laws and changes in tariff rates;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and difficulties in repatriating funds from certain countries;\n\u2022\nadditional investment, coordination and lead-time necessary to successfully interface our automation solutions with the existing information systems of our customers or potential customers outside of the United States; and\n\u2022\npolitical unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities in areas in which we have facilities.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and address these risks properly, our business or operating results will be harmed.\nWhen we experience delays in installations of our medication and supply dispensing systems or our more complex medication packaging systems, resulting in delays in our ability to recognize revenue, our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe purchase of our medication and supply dispensing systems or our more complex medication packaging systems is often part of a customer's larger initiative to re-engineer its pharmacy and their distribution and materials management systems. As a result, our sales cycles are often lengthy. The purchase of our systems often entail larger strategic purchases by customers that frequently require more complex and stringent contractual requirements and generally involve a significant commitment of management attention and resources by prospective customers. These larger and more complex transactions often require the input and approval of many decision-makers, including pharmacy directors, materials managers, nurse managers, financial managers, information systems managers, administrators, lawyers and boards of directors. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with the sale of our medication and supply dispensing systems is often lengthy and subject to a number of delays over which we have little or no control. A delay in, or loss of, sales of our medication and supply dispensing systems could have an adverse effect upon our operating results and could harm our business.\nIn addition, and in part as a result of the complexities inherent in larger transactions, the time between the purchase and installation of our systems can range from two weeks to one year. Delays in installation can occur for reasons that are often outside of our control. We have also experienced fluctuations in our customer and transaction size mix, which makes our ability to forecast our product bookings more difficult. Because we recognize revenue for our medication and supply dispensing systems and our more complex medication packaging systems only upon installation at a customer's site, any delay in installation by our customers will also cause a delay in the recognition of the revenue for that system.\nGovernment regulation of the healthcare industry could reduce demand for our products, or substantially increase the cost to produce our products.\nThe manufacture and sale of most of our current products are not regulated by the FDA, or the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\"). Through, our acquisition of Aesynt, we now have a Class I, 510(k) exempt medical device that is subject to FDA regulation and will require compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulation as well as medical device reporting. Additional products may be regulated in the future by the FDA, DEA or other federal agencies due to future legislative and regulatory initiatives or reforms. Direct regulation of our business and products by the FDA, DEA or other federal agencies could substantially increase the cost to produce our products and increase the time required to bring those products to market, reduce the demand for our products and reduce our revenues. In addition, healthcare providers and facilities that use our equipment and dispense controlled substances are subject to regulation by the DEA. The failure of these providers and facilities to comply with DEA requirements, including the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, could reduce demand for our products and harm our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. Pharmacies are regulated by individual state boards of pharmacy that issue rules for pharmacy licensure in their respective jurisdictions. State boards of pharmacy do not license or approve our medication and supply dispensing systems; however, pharmacies using our equipment are subject to state board approval. The failure of such pharmacies to meet differing requirements from a significant number of state boards of pharmacy could decrease demand for our products and harm our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, hospitals must be accredited by The Joint Commission in order to be eligible for Medicaid and Medicare funds. The Joint Commission does not approve or accredit medication and supply dispensing systems; however, disapproval of our customers' medication and supply dispensing management methods and their failure to meet The Joint Commission requirements could decrease demand for our products and harm our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we have implemented a Privacy and Use of Information Policy and adhere to established privacy principles, use of customer information guidelines and related federal and state statutes, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with all federal and state healthcare information privacy and security laws that we are directly or indirectly subject to, including, without limitation, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"). Among other things, this legislation required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt national standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health information transactions and protecting the privacy and security of personally identifiable health\ninformation maintained or transmitted by \"covered entities,\" which include pharmacies and other healthcare providers with which we do business.\nThe standards adopted to date include, among others, the \"Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information,\" which restrict the use and disclosure of personally identifiable health information by covered entities, and the \"Security Standards,\" which require covered entities to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the integrity and security of certain electronic health information. Under HIPAA, we are considered a \"business associate\" in relation to many of our customers that are covered entities, and as such, most of these customers have required that we enter into written agreements governing the way we handle and safeguard certain patient health information we may encounter in providing our products and services and may impose liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations. Further, pursuant to changes in HIPAA under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\"ARRA\"), we are now also covered under HIPAA similar to other covered entities and in some cases, subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as a covered entity. A number of states have also enacted privacy and security statutes and regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than HIPAA and may also apply directly to us. If our past or present operations are found to violate any of these laws, we may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions.\nFollowing the theft in November 2012 of Omnicell electronic device containing customer medical dispensing cabinets log files, we were subject to a putative class action complaint. The complaint was subsequently dismissed without prejudice and plaintiff failed to file an appeal within the requisite deadlines. There is no guarantee that, if we are involved in any similar litigation in the future, such an outcome will result. Any similar unauthorized disclosure of personal health information could cause us to experience contractual indemnification obligations under business associate agreements with certain customers, litigation against us, reputational harm and a reduction in demand from our customers. To the extent that this disclosure is deemed to be a violation of HIPAA or other privacy or security laws, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties and other sanctions.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the potential impact of future HIPAA standards and other federal and state privacy and security laws that may be enacted at any time on our customers or on Omnicell. These laws could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, which could reduce the demand for our products or force us to redesign our products in order to meet regulatory requirements.\nCovenants in our credit agreement restrict our business and operations in many ways and if we do not effectively manage our compliance with these covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Credit Agreement contains various customary covenants that limit our ability and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations or other persons;\n\u2022\nissue redeemable preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments, acquisitions (including acquisitions of exclusive licenses) and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nThe Credit Agreement also includes financial covenants requiring us not to exceed a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio of 3.00:1 (subject to certain exceptions) and to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50:1. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants under the Credit Agreement could result in a default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, which could permit the administrative agent or the lenders to declare all or part of any outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable, or to refuse to permit additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions to take advantage of certain business opportunities that may be presented to us. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, the administrative agent and the lenders under the Credit Agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt, which would seriously harm our business.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel, our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the continuing contributions of our key management, sales, technical and engineering staff. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel. As more of our products are installed in increasingly complex environments, greater technical expertise will be required. As our installed base of customers increases, we will also face additional demands on our customer service and support personnel, requiring additional resources to meet these demands. We may experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel. Competition for qualified technical, engineering, managerial, sales, marketing, financial reporting and other personnel can be intense and may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Competitors have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to recruit our employees.\nIn addition, we have historically used stock options, restricted stock units and other forms of equity compensation as key components of our employee compensation program in order to align employees' interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation packages. The effect of managing share-based compensation expense and minimizing shareholder dilution from the issuance of new shares may make it less favorable for us to grant stock options, restricted stock units or other forms of equity compensation, to employees in the future. In order to continue granting equity compensation at competitive levels, we must seek stockholder approval for any increases to the number of shares reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans, such as the share increase that was approved at our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and we cannot assure you that we will receive such approvals in the future. Any failure to receive approval for current or future proposed increases could prevent us from granting equity compensation at competitive levels and make it more difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees. Further, to the extent that we expand our business or product lines through the acquisition of other businesses, any failure to receive any such approvals could prevent us from securing employment commitments from such newly acquired employees. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could harm our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the past, we have experienced substantial fluctuations in customer demand, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to respond proactively to future changes in customer demand.\nOur ability to adjust to fluctuations in our revenue while still achieving or sustaining profitability is dependent upon our ability to manage costs and control expenses. If our revenue increases or decreases rapidly, we may not be able to manage these changes effectively. Future growth is dependent on the continued demand for our products, the volume of installations we are able to complete, our ability to continue to meet our customers' needs and provide a quality installation experience and our flexibility in manpower allocations among customers to complete installations on a timely basis.\nRegarding our expenses, our ability to control expense is dependent on our ability to continue to develop and leverage effective and efficient human and information technology systems, our ability to gain efficiencies in our workforce through the local and worldwide labor markets and our ability to grow our outsourced vendor supply model. Our expense growth rate may equal or exceed our revenue growth rate if we are unable to streamline our operations, or fail to reduce the costs or increase the margins of our products. In addition, we may not be able to reduce our expenses to keep pace with any reduction in our revenue, which could harm our results of operations and financial position.\nIf we fail to develop new products or enhance our existing products to react to rapid technological change and market demands in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business will suffer.\nWe must develop new products or enhance our existing products with improved technologies to meet rapidly evolving customer requirements. We are constantly engaged in the development process for next generation products, and we need to successfully design our next generation and other products for customers who continually require higher performance and functionality at lower costs. The development process for these advancements is lengthy and usually requires us to accurately anticipate technological innovations and market trends. Developing and enhancing these products can be time-consuming, costly and complex. Our ability to fund product development and enhancements partially depends on our ability to generate revenues from our existing products.\nThere is a risk that these developments or enhancement, will be late, will have technical problems, fail to meet customer or market specifications and will not be competitive with other products using alternative technologies that offer comparable performance and functionality. We may be unable to successfully develop additional next generation products, new products or product enhancements. Our next generation products or any new products or product enhancements may not be accepted in new or existing markets. Our business will suffer if we fail to continue to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner or on a cost-effective basis.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or breaches of data security, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties and operate other critical functions, including sales and manufacturing processes. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to disruption due to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses or environmental impact. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in our information technology systems, it could negatively impact the coordination of our sales, planning and manufacturing activities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, in order to maximize our information technology efficiency, we have physically consolidated our primary corporate data and computer operations. This concentration, however, exposes us to a greater risk of disruption to our internal information technology systems. Although we maintain offsite back-ups of our data, if operations at our facilities were disrupted, it may cause a material disruption in our business if we are not capable of restoring function on an acceptable time frame.\nIn addition, our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches-whether by employees or others-which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of sensitive and confidential information of our employees, customers, suppliers and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, a security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of, or prevents access to, patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nWhile we have implemented a number of protective measures, including firewalls, antivirus and malware detection tools, patches, log monitors, routine back-ups, system audits, routine password modifications and disaster recovery procedures, such measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events, and in some cases we may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. If we are unable to prevent such security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive patient data. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above.\nIf we are unable to successfully interface our automation solutions with the existing information systems of our customers, they may choose not to use our products and services.\nFor healthcare facilities to fully benefit from our automation solutions, our systems must interface with their existing information systems. This may require substantial cooperation, incremental investment and coordination on the part of our customers and may require coordination with third-party suppliers of the existing information systems. There is little uniformity in the systems currently used by our customers, which complicates the interfacing process. If these systems are not successfully interfaced, our customers could choose not to use or to reduce their use of our automation solutions, which would harm our business. Also, these information systems are impacted by regulatory forces, such as the HITECH Act, Meaningful Use Stages, and HIPAA Omnibus Rules, and may evolve their interoperability functionality accordingly. We expect to comply with the mandatory standards and certifications that enable us to continuously interoperate with partner information system, but such symbiotic evolution in a changing regulatory environment can at times create an execution risk.\nAdditionally, our competitors may enter into agreements with providers of hospital information management systems that are designed to increase the interoperability of their respective products. To the extent our competitors are able to increase the interoperability of their products with those of the major hospital information systems providers, customers who utilize such information systems may choose not to use our products and services. In addition, hospital information systems providers may choose to develop their own solutions that could compete with ours. Furthermore, we expect the importance of interoperability to increase in the next few years. Regulations such as the HITECH Act Meaningful Use Stage 3 are expected to heavily focus on evidence and outcomes. Given our role in care delivery process, the data generated by our products may be a key input for assessing and reporting on clinical outcomes. This may elevate interoperability with information systems to a relative importance to our customers creating a business opportunity and risk.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights could negatively affect our ability to compete.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for technology and processes and our ability to preserve our trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. We have pursued patent protection in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe to be proprietary and for technology that offers us a potential competitive advantage for our products. We intend to continue to pursue such protection in the future. Our issued patents relate to various features of our medication and supply dispensing systems and our packaging systems. We cannot assure you that we will file\nany patent applications in the future, and that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that, if issued, such patents will provide significant protection for our technology and processes. As an example, in September 2014, an action was brought against us, to, among other matters, correct the inventorship of certain patents owned by us. For additional details, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in this annual report. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or that others will not design around the patents we own. All of our system software is copyrighted and subject to the protection of applicable copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, which could harm our competitive position.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary in the future depending on many factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully install our products on a timely basis and meet other contractual obligations necessary to recognize revenue;\n\u2022\nthe size, product mix and timing of orders for our medication and supply dispensing systems, and our medication packaging systems, and their installation and integration;\n\u2022\nthe overall demand for healthcare medication management and supply chain solutions;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe number, timing and significance of product enhancements and new product announcements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and significance of any acquisition or business development transactions that we may consider or negotiate and the revenues, costs and earnings that may be associated with these transactions;\n\u2022\nthe relative proportions of revenues we derive from products and services;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the percentage of sales attributable to our international business;\n\u2022\nour customers' budget cycles;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating expenses and our ability to stabilize expenses;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred to remediate product quality or safety issues;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate cash from our accounts receivable on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe performance of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in our business strategy;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic and political conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates, tax increases and availability of credit markets; and\n\u2022\nvolatility in our stock price and its effect on equity-based compensation expense.\nDue to all of these factors, our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate, which in turn may cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nIf we are unable to maintain our relationships with group purchasing organizations or other similar organizations, we may have difficulty selling our products and services to customers represented by these organizations.\nA number of group purchasing organizations, including Amerinet, Inc., Federal Supply Schedule, First Choice Management Services, Healthcare Purchasing Alliance, LLC, HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P., Magnet, Performance Management Solutions, Vizient (formerly Novation LLC), Premier Healthcare Alliance, L.P. and Resource Optimization & Innovation, LLC have negotiated standard contracts for our products on behalf of their member healthcare organizations. Members of these group purchasing organizations may purchase under the terms of these contracts, which obligate us to pay the group purchasing organization a fee. We have also contracted with the United States General Services Administration, allowing the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Department of Defense and other Federal Government customers to purchase our products. These contracts enable us to more readily sell our products and services to customers represented by these organizations. Some of our contracts with these organizations are terminable at the convenience of either party. The loss of any of these relationships could impact the breadth of our customer base and could impair our ability to meet our revenue targets or increase our revenues. These organizations may not renew our contracts on similar terms, if at all, and they may choose to terminate our contracts before they expire, any of which could cause our revenues to decline.\nIf we are unable to maintain our relationships with major institutional pharmacies, we may experience a decline in the sales of blister cards and other consumables sold to these customers.\nThe institutional pharmacy market consists of significant national suppliers of medications to non-acute care facilities, smaller regional suppliers, and very small local suppliers. Although none of these customers comprised more than 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, they may, in some periods, comprise up to 16% of our Medication\nAdherence segment revenues. If these larger national suppliers were to purchase consumable blister card components from alternative sources, or if alternatives to blister cards were used for medication control, our revenues would decline.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could cause our stock price to decline.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm attesting to the effectiveness of internal control. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting.\nIf the market price of our common stock continues to be highly volatile, the investment value of our common stock may decline.\nOur common stock traded between $26.08 and $40.80 per share during the year ended December 31, 2015. The market price for shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile. In addition, our announcements or external events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. These announcements or external events may include:\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating results;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our relationships with corporate customers;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to the Aesynt Acquisition;\n\u2022\nchanges in the ratings of our common stock by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new products;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies; or\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock market as a whole from time to time has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for technology companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline irrespective of our performance. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. For example, on March 19, 2015, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against Omnicell and two of our executive officers in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California purporting to assert claims on behalf of a class of purchasers of Omnicell stock between May 2, 2014 and March 2, 2015. The complaint alleged that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by purportedly making false and misleading statements regarding the existence of a \u201cside letter\u201d arrangement and the adequacy of internal controls that allegedly resulted in false and misleading financial statements. The Company and the individual defendants were not served with the complaint and on May 20, 2015, the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit without prejudice.\nCircumstances may arise that could prevent the timely reporting of our financial information, which could harm our stock price and quotation on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nOn March 17, 2015, we announced that we were delaying the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 ( the \"Annual Report\") beyond the automatic 15-day extension period permitted under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission because of the internal investigation that we commenced following receipt of a notice from an Omnicell employee on February 27, 2015 alleging, among other matters, the existence of a \u201cside letter\u201d arrangement with an Omnicell customer for certain discounts and Omnicell products that were to be provided at no cost, but which were not reflected in the final invoices paid by such customer.\nBecause we were unable to timely file the Annual Report, on March 18, 2015, we received an expected written notification (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from the NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that Omnicell was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing, due to the delay in filing the Annual Report beyond the extended filing due date. Under the Nasdaq continued listing rules, we had 60 calendar days from the date of the letter to either file the Annual Report or submit a plan to regain compliance.\nDuring the period between the date the Annual Report was due and the date of its filing, our stock price experienced some volatility. We have concluded the investigation causing the delay of the filing of the Annual Report. Even though the results of the investigation led the Company to determine that effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects and that there are no changes required to be made to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements,\nwe cannot assure you that similar circumstances will not arise in the future that will cause us to delay the filing of our periodic financial reports, which could harm our stock price and, if such delay were to continue for a period of time, impact our continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for our products and our business may suffer if we were required to change suppliers to obtain an adequate supply of components, equipment and raw materials on a timely basis.\nAlthough we generally use parts and components for our products with a high degree of modularity, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials that are necessary in the production of our consumable medication packages. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of all components and raw materials in a timely manner from existing sources, or where necessary, from alternative sources of supply. We engage multiple single source third-party manufacturers to build several of our sub-assemblies. The risk associated with changing to alternative vendors, if necessary, for any of the numerous components used to manufacture our products could limit our ability to manufacture our products and harm our business. Due to our reliance on a few single source partners to build our hardware sub-assemblies and on a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials that are necessary in the production of our consumable medication packages, a reduction or interruption in supply from our partners or suppliers, or a significant increase in the price of one or more components could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. In certain circumstances, the failure of any of our suppliers or us to perform adequately could result in quality control issues affecting end users' acceptance of our products. These impacts could damage customer relationships and could harm our business.\nThe conflict minerals provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act could result in additional costs and liabilities.\nIn accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established new disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that use \"conflict minerals\" mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These new requirements could affect the sourcing of materials used in our products as well as the companies we use to manufacture our products. In circumstances where conflict minerals in our products are found to be sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or surrounding countries, we may take actions to change materials or designs to reduce the possibility that our purchase of conflict minerals may fund armed groups in the region. These actions could add engineering and other costs to the manufacture of our products.\nWe expect to incur costs on an ongoing basis to comply with the requirements related to the discovery of the origin of the tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold used in our products, including components we purchase from third parties, and to audit our conflict minerals disclosures. Our reputation may also suffer if we have included conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or surrounding countries in our products.\nOur U.S. government lease agreements are subject to annual budget funding cycles and mandated unilateral changes, which may affect our ability to enter into such leases or to recognize revenue and sell receivables based on these leases.\nU.S. government customers that lease our equipment typically sign contracts with five-year payment terms that are subject to one-year government budget funding cycles. Further, the government has in certain circumstances mandated unilateral changes in its Federal Supply Services contract that could render our lease terms with the government less attractive. In our judgment and based on our history with these accounts, we believe these receivables are collectible. However, in the future, the failure of any of our U.S. government customers to receive their annual funding, or the government mandating changes to the Federal Supply Services contract could impair our ability to sell lease equipment to these customers or to sell our U.S. government receivables to third-party leasing companies. In addition, the ability to collect payments on unsold receivables could be impaired and may result in a write-down of our unsold receivables from U.S. government customers. The balance of our unsold leases to U.S. government customers was $12.1 million as of December 31, 2015.\nIf we fail to manage our inventory properly, our revenue, gross margin and profitability could suffer.\nManaging our inventory of components and finished products is a complex task. A number of factors, including, but not limited to, the need to maintain a significant inventory of certain components that are in short supply or that must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing, the general unpredictability of demand for specific products and customer requests for quick delivery schedules, may result in us maintaining large amounts of inventory. Other factors, including changes in market demand, customer requirements and technology, may cause our inventory to become obsolete. Any excess or obsolete inventory could result in inventory write-downs, which in turn could harm our business and results of operations.\nIntellectual property claims against us could harm our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect that developers of medication and supply dispensing systems and medication packaging systems, will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. In the future, third parties may claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights with respect to current or future products. We do not carry special insurance that covers intellectual property infringement claims; however, such claims may be covered under our traditional insurance policies. These policies contain terms, conditions and exclusions that make recovery for intellectual property infringement claims difficult to guarantee. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management's attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. These royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could harm our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur software products are complex and may contain defects, which could harm our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe market products that contain software and products that are software only. Although we perform extensive testing prior to releasing software products, these products may contain undetected errors or bugs when first released. These may not be discovered until the product has been used by customers in different application environments. Failure to discover product deficiencies or bugs could require design modifications to previously shipped products or cause delays in the installation of our products and unfavorable publicity or negatively impact system shipments, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProduct liability claims against us could harm our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur products provide medication management and supply chain management solutions for the healthcare industry. Despite the presence of healthcare professionals as intermediaries between our products and patients, if our products fail to provide accurate and timely information or operate as designed, customers, patients or their family members could assert claims against us for product liability. Moreover, failure of health-care facility employees to use our products for their intended purposes could result in product liability claims against us. Litigation with respect to product liability claims, regardless of any outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management's attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. We possess a variety of insurance policies that include coverage for general commercial liability and technology errors and omissions liability. We attempt to mitigate these risks through contractual terms negotiated with our customers. However, these policies and protective contractual terms may not be adequate against product liability claims. A successful claim brought against us, or any claim or product recall that results in negative publicity about us, could harm our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. Also, in the event that any of our products is defective, we may be required to recall or redesign those products.\nWe are dependent on technologies provided by third-party vendors, the loss of which could negatively and materially affect our ability to market, sell, or distribute our products.\nSome of our products incorporate technologies owned by third parties that are licensed to us for use, modification, and distribution. If we lose access to third-party technologies, or we lose the ongoing rights to modify and distribute these technologies with our products, we will have to devote resources to independently develop, maintain and support the technologies ourselves, pay increased license costs, or transition to another vendor. Any independent development, maintenance or support of these technologies by us or the transition to alternative technologies could be costly, time consuming and could delay our product releases and upgrade schedules. These factors could negatively and materially affect our ability to market, sell or distribute our products.\nComplications in connection with our ongoing business information system upgrades, including those required to transition acquired entities onto information systems already utilized, and those implemented to adopt new accounting standards, may impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe continue to upgrade our enterprise-level business information system with new capabilities and transition acquired entities onto information systems already utilized in the company. In 2015, we replaced legacy Enterprise Requirements Planning systems used in the acquired Surgichem business with systems currently in use in other parts of Omnicell. In 2016, we intend to replace the legacy enterprise Requirements Planning systems used in Avantec and Mach4 with systems currently in use in other parts of Omnicell. Based upon the complexity of some of the upgrades, there is risk that we will not see the expected benefit from the implementation of these upgrades in accordance with their anticipated timeline and will incur costs in addition to those we have already planned for. In addition, in future years, we may need to begin efforts to comply with final converged accounting standards to be established by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") for revenues, leases and other components of our financial reporting. These new standards could require us to modify our accounting policies. We further anticipate that integration of these and possibly other new standards may require a substantial\namount of management's time and attention and require integration with our enterprise resource planning system. The implementation of the system and the adoption of future new standards, in isolation as well as together, could result in operating inefficiencies and financial reporting delays, and could impact our ability to record certain business transactions timely. All of these potential results could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOutstanding employee stock options have the potential to dilute stockholder value and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe grant stock options to certain of our employees as incentives to join Omnicell or as an on-going reward and retention vehicle. We had options outstanding to purchase approximately 2.7 million shares of our common stock, at a weighted-average exercise price of $22.89 per share as of December 31, 2015. If some or all of these shares are sold into the public market over a short time period, the price of our common stock may decline, as the market may not be able to absorb those shares at the prevailing market prices. Such sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future on terms that we deem acceptable.\nChanges in our tax rates, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: changes in the mix of earnings with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. We are also subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results.\nWe rely on our network infrastructure, data centers, enterprise applications, and technology systems for the development, marketing, support and sales of our products, and for the internal operation of our business. These systems are susceptible to disruption or failure in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic event. Many of these systems are housed or supported in or around our corporate headquarters located in Northern California, near major earthquake faults, and where a significant portion of our research and development activities and other critical business operations take place. Other critical systems, including our manufacturing facilities for our consumable medication packages, are housed in St. Petersburg, Florida, in communities that have been subject to significant tropical storms. Disruptions to or the failure of any of these systems, and the resulting loss of critical data, which is not quickly recoverable by the effective execution of disaster recovery plans designed to reduce such disruption, could cause delays in our product development, prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders, and could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, the result of which would adversely affect our operating results.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law, and any stockholders' rights plan we may adopt in the future, make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Certain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult, even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders. Our anti-takeover provisions include provisions in our certificate of incorporation providing that stockholders' meetings may only be called by our Board of Directors and provisions in our bylaws providing that the stockholders may not take action by written consent and requiring that stockholders that desire to nominate any person for election to our Board of Directors or to make any proposal with respect to business to be conducted at a meeting of our stockholders be submitted in appropriate form to our Secretary within a specified period of time in advance of any such meeting. Delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of 15% or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, our Board of Directors approves the transaction. Our Board of Directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.\nThe stockholder rights plan adopted by our Board of Directors in February 2003 expired by its terms in February 2013. Our Board of Directors could adopt a similar plan in the future if it determines that such action is in the best interests of our stockholders. Such a plan may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 89110, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "OMCL"}
