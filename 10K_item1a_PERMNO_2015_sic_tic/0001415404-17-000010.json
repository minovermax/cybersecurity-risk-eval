{"cik": "1415404", "company": "EchoStar CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operation, prospects or ability to fund a share repurchase program, invest capital in our business or return capital to our shareholders could be materially and adversely affected.\nGENERAL RISKS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our primary customer, DISH Network. If the Share Exchange is not consummated, the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from, or a decrease in selling prices of digital set-top boxes, broadband equipment and services, provision of satellite services and digital broadcast services, and/or other products, components or services to DISH Network would significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely impact our results of operations.\nDISH Network accounted for 52.3%, 53.5% and 57.3% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. DISH Network is currently our primary customer of digital set-top boxes, digital broadcast operation services and our satellite services. DISH Network is also a wholesale distributor of the Hughes satellite internet service, and in connection with such wholesale distribution, purchases certain broadband equipment from us to support the sale of the Hughes service. In addition, DISH Network has no obligations to continue to purchase our products and only certain obligations to continue to purchase certain of our services. Therefore, our relationship with DISH Network could be terminated or substantially curtailed with little or no advance notice. Any material reduction in or termination of our sales to DISH Network or reduction in the prices it pays for the products and services it purchases from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nDISH Network is involved in several legal proceedings relating to products, components and services purchased from us. Adverse decisions against DISH Network in these proceedings could decrease the number of products, components and/or services we provide to DISH Network, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nIn addition, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from DISH Network, our success also depends to a significant degree on the continued success of DISH Network in attracting new subscribers and marketing programming packages and other services and features to subscribers that will result in the purchase of new digital set-top boxes, and in particular, new digital set-top boxes at the high-end of our product range that incorporate high-definition, multiple tuners, and other advanced technology.\nIn addition, the timing of orders for digital set-top boxes from DISH Network could vary significantly depending on equipment promotions offered to its subscribers, changes in technology, and its use of remanufactured digital set-top boxes, which may cause our revenue to vary significantly quarter over quarter and could expose us to the risks of inventory shortages or excess inventory. These inventory risks are particularly acute during product end-of-life transitions in which a new generation of digital set-top boxes is being deployed and inventory of older generation digital set-top boxes is at a higher risk of obsolescence. This in turn could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nThere are a relatively small number of potential new customers for our digital set-top boxes and digital broadcast operations, and we expect this customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. If we lose DISH Network as a customer, it may be difficult for us to replace, in whole or in part, our historical revenue from DISH Network as we have had limited success in attracting such potential new customers in the past. Furthermore, because of the maturing and competitive nature of the digital set-top box business, the limited number of potential new customers, and the short-term nature of our purchase orders with DISH Network, we have experienced, and could in the future continue to experience, downward pricing pressure on our digital set-top boxes sold to DISH Network, which in turn would adversely affect our gross margins and profitability. Historically, many potential customers have perceived us as a competitor due to our affiliation with DISH Network. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into any commercial relationships with potential new customers who are competitors of DISH Network (particularly if we continue to be perceived as affiliated with DISH Network as a result of common ownership and certain shared services). If we do not develop relationships with new customers, we may not be able to expand our customer base or maintain or increase our revenue.\nOur strategic initiatives may not be successfully implemented, may not elicit the expected customer response in the market and may result in competitive reactions.\nWe have identified a number of strategic initiatives that we intend to pursue which are discussed in more detail in Item 1. - Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The successful implementation of those strategic initiatives requires an investment of time, talent and money and is dependent upon a number of factors some of which are not within our control. Those factors include the ability to execute such initiatives in the market, the response of existing and potential new customers, and the actions or reactions of competitors. We may allocate significant resources for long-term initiatives that may not have a short or medium term or any positive impact on our revenue, results of operations, or cash flow. If we fail to properly execute or deliver products or services that address customers\u2019 expectations, it may have an adverse effect on our ability to retain and attract customers and may increase our costs and reduce our revenue. Similarly, competitive actions or reactions to our initiatives or advancements in technology or competitive products or services could impair our ability to execute those strategic initiatives or advancements. In addition, new strategic initiatives may face barriers to entering existing markets with established competitors. There can be no assurance that we will successfully implement these strategic initiatives or that, if successfully pursued, they will have the desired effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe could face decreased demand and increased pricing pressure to our products and services due to competition.\nOur business operates in an intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment and competes with a growing number of companies that provide products and services to consumers. Risks to our business from competition include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nThe digital set-top box market is intensely competitive, and market leadership changes frequently as a result of new products, designs, pricing and regulations. We currently face competition from well-established companies, from new, rapidly growing companies, and from digital video providers who have developed their own digital set-top boxes, and in the future we may face competition from new and existing companies that do not currently compete in the market for set-top boxes. If we do not distinguish our products, particularly our retail products, through distinctive, technologically advanced features and design, as well as build and strengthen our brand recognition, our business could be harmed as we may not be able to effectively compete on price alone against new low cost market entrants. Increased pricing pressure may also make it particularly difficult for us to make profitable sales in international markets where new competitors are present and in which we have not previously made sales of set-top boxes. In addition, it can be difficult to acquire additional market share in the digital set-top box market because gaining additional market share would require displacing well-established companies who have had long-term contracts with major cable operators in the U.S., which results in relatively high costs for cable operators to change set-top box providers making it more difficult for us to displace potential customers from their current relationships with our competitors. Any of these competitive threats, alone or in combination with others, could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition if the Share Exchange is not consummated.\n\u2022\nOur EchoStar Satellite Services segment (\u201cESS\u201d) competes against larger, well-established satellite service companies, such as Intelsat, SES, Telesat, and Eutelsat. Because the satellite services industry is relatively mature, our growth strategy depends largely on our ability to displace current incumbent providers, which often have the benefit of long-term contracts with customers. These long-term contracts and other factors result in relatively high costs for customers to change service providers, making it more difficult for us to displace customers from their current relationships with our competitors. In addition, the supply of satellite capacity available in the market has increased in recent years, which makes it more difficult for us to sell our services in certain markets and to price our capacity at acceptable levels. Competition may cause downward pressure on prices and further reduce the utilization of our capacity, both of which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. Our ESS segment also competes with both fiber optic cable and terrestrial delivery systems, which may have a cost advantage, particularly in point-to-point applications where such delivery systems have been installed, and with new delivery systems being developed, which may have lower latency and other advantages.\n\u2022\nIn our consumer market, we face competition primarily from DSL, fiber and cable internet service providers. Also, other telecommunications, satellite and wireless broadband companies have launched or are planning the launch of consumer internet access services in competition with our service offerings in North America and Brazil. Some of these competitors offer consumer services and hardware at lower prices than ours. In addition, terrestrial alternatives do not require our external dish, which may limit customer acceptance of our products. We may be unsuccessful in competing effectively against DSL, fiber and cable internet service providers and other satellite broadband providers, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u2022\nIn our enterprise network communications market, we face competition from providers of terrestrial-based networks, such as fiber, DSL, cable modem service, multiprotocol label switching and internet protocol-based virtual private networks, which may have advantages over satellite networks for certain customer applications. Although we also sell terrestrial services to this market, we may not be as cost competitive and it may become more difficult for us to compete. The network communications industry is characterized by competitive pressures to provide enhanced functionality for the same or lower price with each new generation of technology. Terrestrial-based networks are offered by telecommunications carriers and other large companies, many of which have substantially greater financial resources and greater name recognition than us. As the prices of our products decrease, we will need to sell more products and/or reduce the per-unit costs to improve or maintain our results of operations. The costs of a satellite network may exceed those of a terrestrial-based network or other networks, especially in areas that have experienced significant DSL and cable internet build-out. It may become more difficult for us to compete with terrestrial and other providers as the number of these areas increases and the cost of their network and hardware services declines. Terrestrial networks also have a competitive edge because of lower latency for data transmission.\nThe average selling price and gross margins of our digital set-top boxes have been decreasing and may decrease even further, which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nThe average selling price and gross margins of our digital set-top boxes have been decreasing and may decrease even further if the Share Exchange is not consummated due to, among other things, an increase in the sales of lower-priced digital set-top boxes to DISH Network, increased competitive pricing pressure and production costs. Furthermore, our ability to increase the average selling prices of our digital set-top boxes is limited and our average selling price may decrease even further in response to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors, lack of demand for our new product introductions or other factors. If we are unable to increase or at least maintain the average selling prices of our digital set-top boxes, or if such selling prices further decline, and we are unable to respond in a timely manner by developing and introducing new products and continually reducing our product costs, our revenue and gross margin may be negatively affected, which will harm our financial position and results of operations if the Share Exchange is not consummated.\nIf significant numbers of television viewers are unwilling to pay for pay-TV services that utilize digital set-top boxes, we may not be able to sustain our current revenue level if the Share Exchange is not consummated.\nWe are substantially dependent upon the ability of our customers to promote the delivery of pay-TV services, including, among others, premium programming packages and services that utilize technology incorporated into our digital set-top boxes, such as HD technology and IPTV, to generate future revenue. Our customers face emerging competition from other providers of digital media and potential government action preventing them from using security systems in connection with set-top boxes. In particular, programming offered over the internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved.\nOur customers may be unsuccessful in promoting value-added services or may promote alternative packages, such as free programming packages, in lieu of promoting packages that utilize our high-end digital set-top box offerings. If our customers are unable to develop and effectively market compelling reasons for their subscribers to continue to purchase their pay-TV services that utilize our more advanced digital set-top boxes, it will be difficult for us to sustain our historical revenue. Furthermore, as technologies develop, other means of delivering information and entertainment to television viewers have evolved and contributed to, and will likely continue to evolve and contribute to, increasing consumer demand for online platforms that provide for the distribution and viewing of movies, television and other video programming that competes with our customers\u2019 pay-TV services. To the extent that these online platforms and other new technologies compete successfully against our customers for viewers, the ability of our existing customer base to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected. As a result, demand for our satellite television digital set-top boxes could decline, and we may not be able to sustain our current revenue levels.\nWe may have available satellite capacity in our ESS segment, and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we are not able to provide satellite services on this capacity to third parties, including DISH Network.\nWe have available satellite capacity in our ESS segment. While we are currently evaluating various opportunities to make profitable use of our available satellite capacity (including, but not limited to, supplying satellite capacity for new international ventures), there can be no assurance that we can successfully develop these business opportunities. If we are unable to utilize our available satellite capacity for providing satellite services to third parties, including DISH Network, our margins could be negatively impacted, and we may be required to record impairments related to our satellites.\nThe failure to adequately anticipate the need for satellite capacity or the inability to obtain satellite capacity for our Hughes segment could harm our results of operations.\nOur Hughes segment has made substantial contractual commitments for satellite capacity based on our existing customer contracts and backlog. If our existing customer contracts were to be terminated prior to their respective expiration dates, we may be committed to maintaining excess satellite capacity for which we will have insufficient revenue to cover our costs, which would have a negative impact on our margins and results of operations. Alternatively, we may not have sufficient satellite capacity to meet demand. We have satellite capacity commitments, generally for two to five year terms, with third parties to cover different geographical areas or support different applications and features; therefore, we may not be able to quickly or easily adjust our capacity to changes in demand. We generally only purchase satellite capacity based on existing contracts and bookings. Therefore, capacity for certain types of coverage in the future may not be readily available to us, and we may not be able to satisfy certain needs of our customers, which could result in a loss of possible new business and could negatively impact the margins for those services. At present, until the launch and operation of additional satellites, there is limited availability of capacity on the frequencies we use in North America, including within our own fleet of satellites. Our ability to provide additional capacity for subscriber growth in our North American consumer market could also be adversely affected by regulations in the U.S. recently adopted by the FCC that enable the use of a portion of the frequency bands, including without limitation, the Ka-band, where we operate our broadband gateway earth stations, for 5G mobile terrestrial services, which could limit our flexibility to change the way in which we use the Ka-band in the future. In addition, the FSS industry has seen consolidation in the past decade, and today, the main FSS providers in North America and a number of smaller regional providers own and operate the current satellites that are available for our capacity needs. The failure of any of these FSS providers to replace existing satellite assets at the end of their useful lives or a downturn in their industry as a whole could reduce or interrupt the satellite capacity available to us. If we are not able to renew our capacity leases at economically viable rates, or if capacity is not available due to problems experienced by these FSS providers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon third-party providers for components, manufacturing, installation services, and customer support services, and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if any of these third-party providers fail to appropriately deliver the contracted goods or services.\nWe are dependent upon third-party services and products provided to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nComponents. A limited number of suppliers manufacture, and in some cases a single supplier manufactures, some of the key components required to build our products. These key components may not be continually available and we may not be able to forecast our component requirements sufficiently in advance, which may have a detrimental effect on supply. If we are required to change suppliers for any reason, we would experience a delay in manufacturing our products if another supplier is not able to meet our requirements on a timely basis. In addition, if we are unable to obtain the necessary volumes of components on favorable terms or prices on a timely basis, we may be unable to produce our products at competitive prices and we may be unable to satisfy demand from our customers. Our reliance on a single or limited group of suppliers, particularly foreign suppliers, and our reliance on subcontractors, involves several risks. These risks include a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, reduced control over pricing, quality, and timely delivery of these components, and the potential bankruptcy, lack of liquidity or operational failure of our suppliers. We do not generally maintain long-term agreements with any of our suppliers or subcontractors for our products. An inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstances requiring us to seek alternative sources of supply could affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis, which could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our business, resulting in a loss of market share, and reduced revenue and income.\n\u2022\nCommodity Price Risk. Fluctuations in pricing of raw materials can affect our product costs. To the extent that component pricing does not decline or increases, whether due to inflation, increased demand, decreased supply or other factors, we may not be able to pass on the impact of increasing raw materials prices, component prices or labor and other costs, to our customers, and we may not be able to operate profitably. Such changes could have an adverse impact on our product costs.\n\u2022\nManufacturing. While we develop and manufacture prototypes for certain of our products, we use contract manufacturers to produce a significant portion of our hardware. If these contract manufacturers fail to provide products that meet our specifications in a timely manner, then our customer relationships and revenue may be harmed.\n\u2022\nInstallation and customer support services . Some of our products and services, such as our North American and international operations, utilize a network of third-party installers to deploy our hardware. In addition, a portion of our customer support and management is provide\nd by offshore call centers. A decline in levels of service or attention to the needs of our customers could adversely affect our reputation, renewal rates and ability to win new business.\n\u2022\nOther services. Some of our products rely on third parties to provide services necessary for the operation of functionalities of the products, such as third party cloud computing services. The failure of these services could disrupt the operation of certain functionalities of our products, which could harm our customer relationship and result in a loss of sales. In addition, if the agreements for the provision of these services are terminated or not renewed, we could face difficulties replacing these service providers, which would adversely affect our ability to obtain and retain customers and result in reduced revenue and income.\nOur foreign operations expose us to regulatory risks and restrictions not present in our domestic operations.\nOur sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 14.2%, 14.6% and 14.1% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Collectively, we expect our foreign operations to continue to represent a significant portion of our business. Over the last 10 years, we have sold products in over 100 countries. Our foreign operations involve varying degrees of risk and uncertainties inherent in doing business abroad. Such risks include:\n\u2022\nComplications in complying with restrictions on foreign ownership and investment and limitations on repatriation. We may not be permitted to own our operations in some countries and may have to enter into partnership or joint venture relationships. Many foreign legal regimes restrict our repatriation of earnings to the U.S. from our subsidiaries and joint venture entities. Applicable law in such foreign countries may also limit our ability to distribute or access our assets in certain circumstances. In such event, we will not have access to the cash flow and assets of our subsidiaries and joint ventures.\n\u2022\nDifficulties in following a variety of laws and regulations related to foreign operations. Our international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of many different jurisdictions that may differ significantly from U.S. laws and regulations. For example, local political or intellectual property law may hold us responsible for the data that is transmitted over our network by our customers. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or giving or promising to give anything of value to foreign officials and other individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining a competitive advantage. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. However, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree. Compliance with these laws may lead to increased operations costs or loss of business opportunities. Violations of these laws could result in fines or other penalties or sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022\nRestrictions on space station landing/terrestrial rights. Satellite market access and landing rights and terrestrial wireless rights are dependent on the national regulations established by foreign governments, including, but not limited to obtaining national authorizations or approvals and meeting other regulatory, coordination and registration requirements for satellites. Because regulatory schemes vary by country, we may be subject to laws or regulations in foreign countries of which we are not presently aware. Non-compliance with these requirements may result in the loss of the authorizations and licenses to conduct business in these countries, as well as fines or other financial and non-financial penalties for non-compliance with regulations. If that were to be the case, we could be subject to sanctions and/or other actions by a foreign government that could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate in that country. There is no assurance that any current regulatory approvals held by us are, or will remain, sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities, or that any additional necessary approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all, in all jurisdictions in which we wish to operate new satellites, or that applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions will not be unduly burdensome. Violations of laws or regulations may result in various sanctions including fines, loss of authorizations and the denial of applications for new authorizations or for the renewal of existing authorizations, and the failure to obtain or comply with the authorizations and regulations governing our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and our overall competitive position.\n\u2022\nFinancial and legal constraints and obligations. Operating pursuant to foreign licenses subjects us to certain financial constraints and obligations, including, but not limited to: (a) tax liabilities that may or may not be dependent on revenue; (b) the burden of creating and maintaining additional entities, branches, facilities and/or staffing in foreign jurisdictions; and (c) legal regulations requiring that we make certain satellite capacity available for \u201cfree,\u201d which may impact our revenue. In addition, if we need to pursue legal remedies against our customers or our business partners located outside of the U.S., it may be difficult for us to enforce our rights against them.\n\u2022\nCompliance with applicable export control laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries . We must comply with all applicable export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, ITAR, EAR and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by OFAC. The export of certain hardware, technical data and services\nrelating to satellites is regulated by BIS under EAR. Other items are controlled for export by the DDTC under ITAR. We cannot provide equipment or services to certain countries subject to U.S. trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from OFAC. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, debarments from export privileges, or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of ITAR or the other regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nChanges in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. We conduct our business and incur cost in the local currency of a number of the countries in which we operate. Accordingly, our applicable results of operations are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to U.S. dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. In addition, we sell our products and services and acquire supplies and components from countries that historically have been, and may continue to be, susceptible to recessions or currency devaluation. These fluctuations in currency exchange rates, recessions and currency devaluations have affected, and may in the future affect, revenue, profits and cash earned on international sales.\n\u2022\nGreater exposure to the possibility of economic instability, the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances, expropriation or war. As we conduct operations throughout the world, we could be subject to regional or national economic downturns or instability, acts of terrorism, labor or political disturbances or conflicts of various sizes, including wars. Any of these disruptions could detrimentally affect our sales in the affected region or country or lead to damage to, or expropriation of, our property or danger to our personnel.\n\u2022\nCompetition with large or state-owned enterprises and/or regulations that effectively limit our operations and favor local competitors. Many of the countries in which we conduct business have traditionally had state owned or state granted monopolies on telecommunications services that favor an incumbent service provider. We face competition from these favored and entrenched companies in countries that have not deregulated. The slower pace of deregulation in these countries, particularly in Asia and Latin America, has adversely affected the growth of our business in these regions.\n\u2022\nCustomer credit risks. Customer credit risks are exacerbated in foreign operations because there is often little information available about the credit histories of customers in certain of the foreign countries in which we operate.\nWe may experience loss from some of our customer contracts.\nWe provide access to our telecommunications networks to customers that use a variety of platforms such as satellite, wireless 3G and 4G, cable, fiber optic and DSL. These customer contracts may require us to provide services at a fixed price for the term of the contract. To facilitate the provision of this access, we may enter into contracts with terrestrial platform providers. Our agreements with these subcontractors may allow for prices to be changed during the term of the contracts. We assume greater financial risk on these customer contracts than on other types of contracts because if we do not estimate costs accurately and there is an increase in our subcontractors\u2019 prices, our net profit may be significantly reduced or there may be a loss on the contracts.\nWe may experience significant financial losses on our existing investments.\nWe have entered into certain strategic transactions and investments. These investments involve a high degree of risk and could diminish our financial condition or our ability to fund a share repurchase program, invest capital in our business or return capital to our shareholders. The overall sustained economic uncertainty, as well as financial, operational and other difficulties encountered by certain companies in which we have invested increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our debt and equity investments will differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. In addition, the companies in which we invest or with whom we partner may not be able to compete effectively or there may be insufficient demand for the services and products offered by these companies. These investments could also expose us to significant financial losses and may restrict our ability to make other investments or limit alternative uses of our capital resources. If our investments suffer losses, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, capital expenditures and other strategic transactions to complement or expand our business, which may not be successful and we may lose a portion or all of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions.\nOur future success may depend on the existence of, and our ability to capitalize on, opportunities to acquire or develop other businesses or technologies or partner with other companies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business, services or products or that may otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or other\nbusiness combination or development activities to complement or expand our business. Any such acquisitions, transactions or investments that we are able to identify and complete which may become substantial over time, involve a high degree of risk, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business, technology or joint venture;\n\u2022\nthe ability and capacity of our management team to carry out all of our business plans, including with respect to our existing businesses and any businesses we acquire or embark on in the future;\n\u2022\npossible adverse effects on our and our targets\u2019 and partners\u2019 business, financial condition or operating results during the integration process;\n\u2022\nexposure to significant financial losses if the transactions, investments and/or the underlying ventures are not successful; and/or we are unable to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction or investment;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain in the anticipated time frame, or at all, any regulatory approvals required to complete proposed acquisitions, transactions or investments;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with complying with regulations applicable to the acquired or developed business or technologies which may cause us to incur substantial expenses;\n\u2022\nthe inability to realize anticipated benefits or synergies from an acquisition; and\n\u2022\nthe disruption of relationships with employees, vendors or customers.\nNew acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other transactions may require the commitment of significant capital that may otherwise be directed to investments in our existing businesses or be distributed to shareholders. Commitment of this capital may cause us to defer or suspend any share repurchases or capital expenditures that we otherwise may have made.\nWe may not be able to generate cash to meet our debt service needs or fund our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was approximately $3.66 billion. Our ability to make payments on or to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject in part to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may need to raise additional debt in order to fund ongoing operations or to capitalize on business opportunities. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our operations or other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash, we may be forced to take actions such as revising or delaying our strategic plans, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to implement any of these actions on satisfactory terms, or at all. The indentures governing our indebtedness limit our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions. Therefore, we may not be able to consummate those dispositions on satisfactory terms, or at all, or to use those proceeds in a manner we may otherwise prefer.\nIn addition, conditions in the financial markets could make it difficult for us to access capital markets at acceptable terms or at all. Instability or other conditions in the equity markets could make it difficult for us to raise equity financing without incurring substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. In addition, sustained or increased economic weaknesses or pressures or new economic conditions may limit our ability to generate sufficient internal cash to fund investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other strategic transactions. We cannot predict with any certainty whether or not we will be impacted by economic conditions. As a result, these conditions make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities because we may not have access to funding sources necessary for us to pursue organic and strategic business development opportunities.\nCovenants in our indentures restrict our business in many ways.\nThe indentures governing the Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation (\u201cHSS\u201d), a subsidiary of EchoStar, 6 1/2% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the \u201c2019 Senior Secured Notes\u201d), 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2021 (the \u201c2021 Senior Unsecured Notes\u201d), 5.250% Senior Secured Notes due August 1, 2026 (the \u201c2026 Senior Secured Notes\u201d) and 6.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due August 1, 2026 (the \u201c2026 Senior Unsecured Notes\u201d and together with the 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d) contain various covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on HSS\u2019 capital stock or repurchase HSS\u2019 capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another company;\n\u2022\ntransfer and sell assets; and\n\u2022\nallow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of certain of HSS\u2019 subsidiaries to pay dividends, make distributions, make other payments, or transfer assets to HSS or its subsidiaries.\nFailure to comply with these and certain other financial covenants, if not cured or waived, may result in an event of default under the indentures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the respective indenture, the trustee under that indenture or the requisite holders of the notes under that indenture may declare all such notes to be immediately due and payable and, in the case of the indentures governing any of our secured notes, could proceed against the collateral that secures the applicable secured notes. We and certain of our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure the 2019 Senior Secured Notes and the 2026 Senior Secured Notes. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt or fund other liquidity needs, we may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from the holders of the notes, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies can be implemented on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could result in the trustee declaring the notes to be immediately due and payable and/or foreclosing on the collateral.\nWe rely on key personnel and the loss of their services may negatively affect our businesses.\nWe believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the performance of Mr. Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, and certain other key executives. The loss of Mr. Ergen or of certain other key executives or of the ability of Mr. Ergen or certain other key executives to devote sufficient time and effort to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although most of our key executives have agreements limiting their ability to work for or consult with competitors, under certain circumstances, we generally do not have employment agreements with them. To the extent Mr. Ergen or other officers are performing services to both DISH Network and us, their attention may be diverted away from our business and therefore adversely affect our business.\nPursuant to the terms of our preferred tracking stock and related agreements and policies, we could be required to use assets attributed to one group to pay liabilities attributed to the other group if the Share Exchange is not consummated.\nEven though we attribute, for financial reporting purposes, all of our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows to either the EchoStar Group or the Hughes Retail Group (see Note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report for definitions and a further discussion of the preferred tracking stock, the EchoStar Group and the Hughes Retail Group) and prepare separate attributed financial information for the Hughes Retail Group, we retain legal title to all of our assets and our capitalization will not limit our legal responsibility, or that of our subsidiaries, for the liabilities included in our financial statements and such attributed financial information. As such, the assets attributed to one group are potentially subject to the liabilities attributed to the other group, even if those liabilities arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness that are attributed to such other group. Although the policy statement (the \u201cPolicy Statement\u201d) regarding the relationships between the EchoStar Group and the Hughes Retail Group with respect to matters such as the attribution and allocation of costs, tax liabilities and benefits, attribution of assets, corporate opportunities and similar items generally requires that all changes in the attribution of assets from one group to the other group will be made on a fair value basis as determined in accordance with certain guiding principles, these policies and our articles of incorporation generally do not prevent us from satisfying liabilities of one group with assets of the other group, and our creditors are not limited by our tracking stock capitalization from proceeding against any assets they could have proceeded against if we did not have a tracking stock capitalization.\nWe may be subject to risks relating to the referendum of the United Kingdom\u2019s membership of the European Union.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union and its member states (\u201cEU\u201d), commonly referred to as the \u201cBrexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the U.K. government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and EU countries.\nAdditionally, with the U.K. no longer being a part of the EU, we anticipate that there may be certain regulatory changes that may impact the regulatory regime under which we operate in both the U.K. and the EU. These and other changes, implications and consequences of the Brexit may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA natural disaster could diminish our ability to provide service to our customers.\nNatural disasters could damage or destroy our ground stations, resulting in a disruption of service to our customers. We currently have backup systems and technology in place to safeguard our antennas and protect our ground stations during natural disasters such as tornadoes, but the possibility still exists that our ground facilities could be impacted during a major natural disaster. If a future natural disaster impairs or destroys any of our ground facilities, we may be unable to provide service to our customers in the affected area for a period of time which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments are required in determining our provisions for income taxes. In the course of preparing our tax provisions and returns, we must make calculations where the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain. Our tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), state, and foreign tax authorities. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SATELLITES\nOur owned and leased satellites in orbit are subject to significant operational and environmental risks that could limit our ability to utilize these satellites.\nSatellites are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, which have occurred and may occur in the future in our satellites and the satellites of other operators as a result of various factors, such as satellite design and manufacturing defects, problems with the power systems or control systems of the satellites and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh environment of space.\nAlthough we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of anomalies in new satellites and provide for redundancies of many critical components in the satellites, we may not be able to prevent anomalies from occurring and may experience anomalies in the future, whether of the types described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components.\nAny single anomaly or series of anomalies could materially and adversely affect our ability to utilize the satellite, our operations and revenue as well as our relationships with current customers and our ability to attract new customers. In particular, future anomalies may result in, among other things, the loss of individual transponders/beams on a satellite, a group of transponders/beams on that satellite or the entire satellite, depending on the nature of the anomaly. Anomalies may also reduce the expected capacity or useful life of a satellite, thereby reducing the revenue that could be generated by that satellite, or create additional expenses due to the need to provide replacement or back-up satellites or satellite capacity earlier than planned.\nThe loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance, which we may not be able to mitigate by using available capacity on other satellites. There can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in-orbit satellites were to fail. In addition, the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could affect our ability to comply with FCC and other regulatory obligations and our ability to fund the construction or acquisition of replacement satellites for our in-orbit fleet in a timely fashion, or at all. There can be no assurance that anomalies will not impact the remaining useful life and/or the commercial operation of any of the satellites in our fleet. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in-orbit satellites were to fail.\nMeteoroid events pose a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites. The probability that meteoroids will damage those satellites increases significantly when the Earth passes through the particulate stream left behind by comets. Occasionally, increased solar activity also poses a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites.\nSome decommissioned spacecraft are in uncontrolled orbits, which pass through the geostationary belt at various points and present hazards to operational spacecraft, including our satellites. We may be required to perform maneuvers to avoid\ncollisions and these maneuvers may prove unsuccessful or could reduce the useful life of the satellite through the expenditure of fuel to perform these maneuvers. The loss, damage or destruction of any of our satellites as a result of an electrostatic storm, collision with space debris, malfunction or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe historically have not carried in-orbit insurance on many of our satellites because we assessed that the cost of insurance was uneconomical relative to the risk of failures. If one or more of our in-orbit uninsured satellites fail, we could be required to record significant impairment charges for the satellite.\nOur satellites have minimum design lives ranging from 12 to 15 years, but could fail or suffer reduced capacity before then.\nGenerally, the minimum design life of each of our satellites ranges from 12 to 15 years. We can provide no assurance, however, as to the actual operational lives of our satellites, which may be shorter or longer than their design lives. Our ability to earn revenue depends on the continued operation of our satellites, each of which has a limited useful life. A number of factors affect the useful lives of the satellites, including, among other things, the quality of their design and construction, the durability of their component parts, the ability to continue to maintain proper orbit and control over the satellite\u2019s functions, the efficiency of the launch vehicle used, and the remaining on-board fuel following orbit insertion. In addition, continued improvements in satellite technology may make obsolete our existing satellites, or any satellites we may acquire in the future, prior to the end of their design lives.\nIn the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may relocate another satellite and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, such relocation would require governmental approval. We cannot be certain that we could obtain such governmental approval. In addition, we cannot guarantee that another satellite will be available for use as a replacement for a failed or lost satellite, or that such relocation can be accomplished without a substantial utilization of fuel. Any such utilization of fuel would reduce the operational life of the replacement satellite.\nOur satellites under construction are subject to risks related to construction and launch that could limit our ability to utilize these satellites.\nSatellite construction and launch are subject to significant risks, including delays, anomalies, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement. Certain launch vehicles that may be used by us have either unproven track records or have experienced launch failures in the past. The risks of launch delay, launch anomalies and launch failure are usually greater when the launch vehicle does not have a track record of previous successful flights. Launch anomalies and failures can result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites, which can take more than three years, and to obtain other launch opportunities. Such significant delays could materially and adversely affect our business, expenses and results of operations, our ability to meet regulatory or contractual required milestones, the availability and our use of other or replacement satellite resources and our ability to provide services to customers as capacity becomes full on existing satellites. In addition, significant delays in a satellite program could give customers who have purchased or reserved capacity on that satellite a right to terminate their service contracts relating to the satellite. We may not be able to accommodate affected customers on other satellites until a replacement satellite is available. A customer\u2019s termination of its service contracts with us as a result of a launch delay or failure would reduce our contracted backlog and our ability to generate revenue. One of our launch services providers is a Russian Federation state-owned company. Recent ongoing political events have created uncertainty as to the stability of U.S. and Russian Federation relations. This could add to risks relative to scheduling uncertainties and timing. Historically, we have not always carried launch insurance for the launch of our satellites. If a launch delay, anomaly or failure were to occur, it could result in the revocation of the applicable license to operate the satellite, undermine our ability to implement our business strategy or develop or pursue existing or future business opportunities with applicable licenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, expenses, assets, revenue, results of operations and ability to fund future satellite procurement and launch opportunities. In addition, the occurrence of launch anomalies and failures, whether on our satellites or those of others, may significantly reduce our ability to place launch insurance for our satellites or make launch insurance uneconomical.\nOur use of certain satellites is often dependent on satellite coordination agreements, which may be difficult to obtain.\nSatellite transmissions and the use of frequencies often are dependent on coordination with other satellite systems operated by U.S. or foreign satellite operators, including governments, and it can be difficult to determine the outcome of these coordination agreements with these other entities and governments. The impact of a coordination agreement may result in the loss of rights\nto the use of certain frequencies or access to certain markets. The significance of such a loss would vary and it can therefore be difficult to determine which portion of our revenue will be impacted.\nFurthermore, the satellite coordination process is conducted under the guidance of the ITU radio regulations and the national regulations of the satellites involved in the coordination process. These rules and regulations could be amended and could therefore materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face interference from other services sharing satellite spectrum.\nThe FCC and other regulators have adopted rules or may adopt rules in the future that allow non-geostationary orbit satellite services to operate on a co-primary basis in the same frequency band as DBS and FSS. The FCC has also authorized the use of multichannel video and data distribution service (\u201cMVDDS\u201d) in the DBS band. Several MVDDS systems are now being commercially deployed. Despite regulatory provisions designed to protect DBS and FSS operations from harmful interference, there can be no assurance that operations by other satellites or terrestrial communication services in the DBS and FSS bands will not interfere with our DBS and FSS operations and adversely affect our business.\nOur dependence on outside contractors could result in delays related to the design, manufacture and launch of our new satellites, which could in turn adversely affect our operating results.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that are able to design and build satellites according to the technical specifications and standards of quality we require, including Airbus Defence and Space, Boeing Satellite Systems, Lockheed Martin, SS/L and Thales Alenia Space. There are also a limited number of launch service providers that are able to launch such satellites, including International Launch Services, Arianespace, Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services and Space Exploration. The loss of any of our manufacturers or launch service providers could increase the cost and result in the delay of the design, construction or launch of our satellites. Even if alternate suppliers for such services are available, we may have difficulty identifying them in a timely manner or we may incur significant additional expense in changing suppliers, and this could result in difficulties or delays in the design, construction or launch of our satellites. Any delays in the design, construction or launch of our satellites could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY\nIf we are unable to properly respond to technological changes, our business could be significantly harmed.\nOur business and the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards and frequent product and service introductions and enhancements. If we or our suppliers are unable to properly respond to or keep pace with technological developments, fail to develop new technologies, or if our competitors obtain or develop proprietary technologies that are perceived by the market as being superior to ours, our existing products and services may become obsolete and demand for our products and services may decline. Even if we keep up with technological innovation, we may not meet the demands of the markets we serve. Furthermore, after we have incurred substantial research and development costs, one or more of the technologies under our development, or under development by one or more of our strategic partners, could become obsolete prior to its introduction. If we are unable to respond to or keep pace with technological advances on a cost-effective and timely basis, or if our products, applications or services are not accepted by the market, then our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur response to technological developments depends, to a significant degree, on the work of technically skilled employees. Competition for the services of such employees is intense. Although we strive to attract, retain and motivate these employees, we may not succeed in these respects.\nWe have made and will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services and related technologies, as well as entry into new business areas. Investments in new technologies and business areas are inherently speculative and commercial success thereof depends on numerous factors including innovativeness, quality of service and support, and effectiveness of sales and marketing. We may not achieve revenue or profitability from such investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, even if such products, services, technologies and business areas become profitable, their operating margins may be minimal.\nOur future growth depends on growing demand for advanced technologies.\nFuture demand and effective delivery for our products will depend significantly on the growing demand for advanced technologies, such as broadband internet connectivity and, if the Share Exchange is not consummated, Ultra HDTV, 3D TV, whole-home HD DVR features, mobile internet delivery of video content, and on digital television operators developing and building infrastructure to provide these advanced technologies. If the deployment of, or demand for, advanced technologies is not as widespread or as rapid as we or our customers expect, our revenue growth will be negatively impacted.\nOur business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. The loss of our intellectual property rights or our infringement of the intellectual property rights of others could have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties, to use our technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims by third parties of intellectual property infringement could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted, which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively or could otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business.\nMoreover, due to the rapid pace of technological change, we rely in part on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses or other required intellectual property rights from these third parties on reasonable terms, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. Technology licensed from third parties may have undetected errors that impair the functionality or prevent the successful integration of our products or services. As a result of any such changes or loss, we may need to incur additional development costs to ensure continued performance of our products or suffer delays until replacement technology, if available, can be obtained and integrated.\nIn addition, we work with third parties such as vendors, contractors and suppliers for the development and manufacture of components that are integrated into our products and our products may contain technologies provided to us by these third parties. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether any such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others. Our vendors, contractors and suppliers may not be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount, above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages. Legal challenges to these intellectual property rights may impair our ability to use the products and technologies that we need in order to operate our business and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are, and may become, party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual property.\nWe are, and may become, subject to various legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of our business. Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services related to those that we offer. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products or services infringes valid intellectual property rights held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing those products or services, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost, or to redesign those products or services in such a way as to avoid infringement. If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we may be unable to license the necessary intellectual property rights at any price, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe may not be aware of all patents and other intellectual property rights that our products and services may potentially infringe. In addition, patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries are confidential until the Patent and Trademark Office either publishes the application or issues a patent (whichever arises first) and, accordingly, our products may infringe claims contained in pending patent applications of which we are not aware. Further, the process of determining definitively whether a patent claim is valid and whether a particular product infringes a valid patent claim often involves expensive and protracted litigation, even if we are ultimately successful on the merits.\nWe cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to intellectual property rights held by others and the availability and cost of any such licenses. Those costs, and their impact on our results of operations, could be material. Damages in patent infringement cases can be substantial, and in certain circumstances, can be trebled. To the extent that we are required to pay unanticipated royalties to third parties, these increased costs of doing business could negatively affect our liquidity and operating results. We are currently defending multiple patent infringement actions and may assert our own actions against parties we suspect of infringing our patents and trademarks. We cannot be certain the courts will conclude these companies do not own the rights they claim, that these rights are not valid, or that our products and services do not infringe on these rights. We also cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain licenses from these persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses, that we would be able to redesign our products and services to avoid infringement. The legal costs associated with defending patent suits and pursuing patent claims against others may be borne by us if we are not awarded reimbursement through the legal process. See further discussion under Item 1. - Business - Patents and Trademarks and Item 3. - Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFuture litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, consumer claims and governmental and other legal proceedings arising from of our business, including new products and services that we may offer. Some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments, settlements or liabilities, any of which could require substantial payments or have other adverse impacts on our revenue, results of operations or cash flow.\nIf the encryption and related security technology used in our products is compromised, sales of our products may decline.\nOur customers use encryption and related security technology obtained from us or our suppliers in the products that they purchase from us to control access to their programming content and to protect their data and products from unauthorized access to the features or functionalities of such products. Such encryption and related security technology has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult. It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our customers\u2019 programming content. As a result, sales of our products may decline, our reputation and customer relationship could be damaged and we may incur additional costs or financial liability in the future if security of our customers\u2019 system is compromised.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies and a disruption, cyber-attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems or technologies may disrupt or harm our business and damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure are important to the operation of our business, which would suffer in the event of system disruptions or failures, such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities. Security breaches, attacks, unauthorized access and other malicious activities have significantly increased in recent years, and some of them have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on computer networks. Our networks, systems and technologies and those of our third-party service providers and our customers may also be vulnerable to such security breaches, attacks, malicious activities and unauthorized access, resulting in misappropriation, misuse, leakage, corruption, unscheduled downtime, falsification and accidental or intentional release or loss of information maintained on our and our third party service providers\u2019 information technology systems and networks, including but not limited to customer, personnel and vendor data. If such risks were to materialize, we could be exposed to significant costs and interruptions, delays or malfunctions in our operations, any of which could damage our reputation and credibility and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be required to expend significant resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches. Although we have significantly invested in and continue to implement generally recognized security measures, these measures may prove to be inadequate and we could be subject to regulatory penalties, fines, sanctions, enforcement actions, remediation obligations, and/or private litigation by parties whose information was improperly accessed, disclosed or misused which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the amount and scope of insurance that we maintain against losses resulting from these events may not be sufficient to compensate us adequately for any disruptions to our business or otherwise cover our losses, including reputational harm and negative publicity\nas well as any litigation liability. In addition, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs is important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. A security breach or attack could impact our ability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure which could have adverse consequences, including the delayed implementation of new offerings, product or service interruptions, and the diversion of development resources.\nIf our products contain defects, we could be subject to significant costs to correct such defects and our product and network service contracts could be delayed or cancelled, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nThe products and the networks we deploy are highly complex, and some may contain defects when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, despite testing and our quality control procedures. For example, our products may contain software \u201cbugs\u201d that can unexpectedly interfere with their operation. Defects may also occur in components and products that we purchase from third parties. In addition, many of our products and network services are designed to interface with our customers\u2019 existing networks, each of which has different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards. Our products and services must interoperate with the other products and services within our customers\u2019 networks, as well as with future products and services that might be added to these networks, to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix all defects in the products and networks we sell. The occurrence of any defects, errors or failures in our products or network services could result in: (i) additional costs to correct such defects; (ii) cancellation of orders and lost revenue; (iii) a reduction in revenue backlog; (iv) product returns or recalls; (v) diversion of our resources; (vi) the issuance of credits to customers and other losses to us, our customers or end-users; (vii) liability for harm to persons and property caused by defects in or failures of our products or services; and (viii) harm to our reputation if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing or warranty repairs. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services and loss of sales, which would harm our reputation and our business and materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE REGULATION OF OUR BUSINESS\nOur business is subject to risks of adverse government regulation.\nOur business is subject to varying degrees of regulation in the U.S. by the FCC, and other federal, state and local entities, and in foreign countries by similar entities and internationally by the ITU. These regulations are subject to the administrative and political process and do change, for political and other reasons, from time to time. For example, the FCC recently adopted an order in its \u201cSpectrum Frontiers\u201d proceeding under which a portion of the Ka-band, in which we operate our broadband gateway earth stations, has been enabled for 5G mobile terrestrial services, which could limit our flexibility to change the way in which we use Ka-band in the future. Other countries in which we currently, or may in the future, operate are also considering regulations that could limit access to the Ka-band or other frequency bands. The FCC has also opened a proceeding on non-geostationary satellites, which may adversely impact our ability to use certain spectrum for user terminals. Moreover, a substantial number of foreign countries in which we have, or may in the future make, an investment, regulate, in varying degrees, the ownership of satellites and other telecommunication facilities/networks and foreign investment in telecommunications companies. Violations of laws or regulations may result in various sanctions including fines, loss of authorizations and the denial of applications for new authorizations or for the renewal of existing authorizations. Further material changes in law and regulatory requirements may also occur, and there can be no assurance that our business and the business of our subsidiaries and affiliates will not be adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation. The failure to obtain or comply with the authorizations and regulations governing our operations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and our overall competitive position and could result in our suffering serious harm to our reputation.\nOur business depends on regulatory authorizations issued by the FCC and state and foreign regulators that can expire, be revoked or modified, and applications for licenses and other authorizations that may not be granted.\nGenerally all satellite, earth stations and other licenses granted by the FCC and most other countries are subject to expiration unless renewed by the regulatory agency. Our satellite licenses are currently set to expire at various times. In addition, we occasionally receive special temporary authorizations that are granted for limited periods of time (e.g., 180 days or less) and subject to possible renewal. Generally, our licenses and special temporary authorizations have been renewed on a routine basis, but there can be no assurance that this will continue. There can be no assurance that the FCC or other regulators will continue granting applications for new licenses or for the renewal of existing ones. If the FCC or other regulators were to cancel, revoke, suspend, or fail to renew any of our licenses or authorizations, or fail to grant our applications for FCC or other licenses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, loss of a frequency authorization would reduce the amount of spectrum available to us, potentially reducing the amount of services\nwe provide to our customers. The significance of such a loss of authorizations would vary based upon, among other things, the orbital location, the frequency band and the availability of replacement spectrum. In addition, the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government and foreign governments often consider legislation and regulatory requirements that could affect us, as could the actions that the FCC and foreign regulatory bodies take. We cannot predict the outcomes of these legislative or regulatory proceedings or their effect on our business.\nIn addition, third parties have or may oppose some of our license applications and pending and future requests for extensions, modifications, waivers and approvals of our licenses. Even if we have fully complied with all of the required reporting, filing and other requirements in connection with our authorizations, it is possible a regulator could decline to grant certain of our applications or requests for authority, or could revoke, terminate, condition or decline to modify, extend or renew certain of our authorizations or licenses.\nOur ability to sell our digital set-top boxes to certain operators if the Share Exchange is not consummated depends on our ability to obtain licenses to use the conditional access systems utilized by these operators.\nOur commercial success in selling our digital set-top boxes to cable television and other operators depends significantly on our ability to obtain licenses to use the conditional access systems deployed by these operators in our digital set-top boxes. In many cases, the intellectual property rights to these conditional access systems are owned by the set-top box manufacturer that currently provides the system operator with its set-top boxes. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain required licenses on commercially favorable terms, or at all. If we do not obtain the necessary licenses, we may be delayed or prevented from pursuing the development of some potential products with cable or other television operators. If the Share Exchange is not consummated, our failure to obtain a license to use the conditional access systems that we may require to develop or commercialize our digital set-top boxes with cable television or other operators, in turn, would harm our ability to grow our customer base and our financial condition, revenue and results of operation.\nWe may face difficulties in accurately assessing and collecting contributions towards the Universal Service Fund.\nBecause our customer contracts often include both telecommunications services, which create obligations to contribute to the USF, and other goods and services, which do not, it can be difficult to determine what portion of our revenue forms the basis for our required contribution to the USF and the amount that we can recover from our customers. If the FCC, which oversees the USF, or a court or other governmental entity were to determine that we computed our USF contribution obligation incorrectly or passed the wrong amount onto our customers, we could become subject to additional assessments, liabilities, or other financial penalties. In addition, the FCC is considering substantial changes to its USF contribution and distribution rules. These changes could impact our future contribution obligations and those of third parties that provide communication services to our business. Any such change to the USF contribution rules could adversely affect our costs of providing service to our customers. In addition, changes to the USF distribution rules could intensify the competition we face by offering subsidies to competing firms and/or technologies.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE PENDING SHARE EXCHANGE\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with the pending Share Exchange.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the pending Share Exchange including, among others, the potential failure to satisfy the conditions to closing, including the conditions related to obtaining required governmental approvals. To the extent that the market price of our Class A common stock reflects an assumption that the Share Exchange will be consummated in the time frame and the manner currently anticipated, any delay or failure to close could cause a decline in such market price. Similarly, any delay or failure to complete the Share Exchange could negatively impact our relationships with DISH Network, other customers, suppliers and employees and could adversely affect our business.\nPending completion of the Share Exchange, the attention of our management may be focused on the transaction and related matters, and diverted from our day-to-day business operations, including from other opportunities that might benefit us. In addition, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, prior to closing of the Share Exchange, we have agreed to conduct the transferring businesses in the ordinary course and not to undertake certain actions without the written consent of DISH Network. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing certain beneficial business opportunities.\nIf we successfully complete the Share Exchange, thus divesting the transferring businesses, our revenues will decrease accordingly and our business will be subject to concentration of the risks that affect our retained businesses. In addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs, expenses and fees for professional services in connection with the pending Share Exchange, which are payable by us regardless of whether the Share Exchange is consummated.\nWe might not be able to engage in certain strategic transactions because we have agreed to certain restrictions to comply with U.S. federal income tax requirements for a tax-free split-off.\nTo preserve the intended tax-free treatment of the Share Exchange, we will undertake upon closing of the Share Exchange to comply with certain restrictions under current U.S. federal income tax laws for split-offs, including (i) refraining from engaging in certain transactions that would result in a fifty percent or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership, (ii) continuing to own and manage our historic businesses, and (iii) limiting sales or redemptions of our and our subsidiary Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation\u2019s common stock. If these restrictions, among others, are not followed, the Share Exchange could be taxable to us and possibly our stockholders. In addition, we could be required to indemnify DISH Network for any tax liability incurred by DISH Network as a result of our non-compliance with these restrictions.\nOTHER RISKS\nWe are controlled by one principal stockholder who is our Chairman.\nCharles W. Ergen, our Chairman, beneficially owns approximately 43.3% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B common stock held by Mr. Ergen into Class A common stock and giving effect to the exercise of options held by Mr. Ergen that are either currently exercisable or may become exercisable within 60 days of February 15, 2017) and possesses approximately 63.6% of the total voting power of all classes of shares (assuming no conversion of the Class B common stock and no conversion of the preferred tracking stock and giving effect to the exercise of options held by Mr. Ergen that are either currently exercisable or may become exercisable within 60 days of February 15, 2017). Mr. Ergen\u2019s beneficial ownership excludes 1,640 shares of our Class A common stock and 14,493,094 shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of our Class B common stock, in each case, currently held by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. These trusts beneficially own approximately 23.6% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B common stock held by such trusts into Class A common stock) and possess approximately 27.6% of our total voting power of all classes of shares (assuming no conversion of the Class B common stock and no conversion of the preferred tracking stock). Thus, Mr. Ergen has the ability to elect a majority of our directors and to control all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. As a result of Mr. Ergen\u2019s voting power, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in the Nasdaq listing rules and, therefore, are not subject to Nasdaq requirements that would otherwise require us to have (i) a majority of independent directors; (ii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (iv) director nominees selected, or recommended for the Board\u2019s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors.\nWe have potential conflicts of interest with DISH Network due to our common ownership.\nQuestions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between DISH Network and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. Areas in which conflicts of interest between DISH Network and us could arise include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nCross officerships, directorships and stock ownership. We have certain overlap in our directors, executive officers and Chairman position with DISH Network, which may lead to conflicting interests. Our board of directors includes persons who are officers or members of the board of directors of DISH Network, including Charles W. Ergen, who serves as the Chairman of and is employed by both companies. Our Chairman, the members of our board of directors and executive officers who overlap with DISH Network also have fiduciary duties to DISH Network\u2019s shareholders. Mr. Vivek Khemka, who remains employed as DISH Network\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, currently also provides services to us pursuant to a Professional Services Agreement as President - EchoStar Technologies L.L.C. Therefore, these individuals may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. For example, there is potential for a conflict of interest when we or DISH Network look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for both companies. In addition, many of our directors and officers own DISH Network stock and options to purchase DISH Network stock, certain of which they acquired or were granted prior to the Spin-off, including Mr. Ergen. Furthermore, until consummation of the Share Exchange, DISH Network holds shares of preferred tracking stock in us and HSS that in the aggregate represents an 80.0% economic interest in our residential retail satellite broadband business. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and DISH Network.\n\u2022\nIntercompany agreements with DISH NetWe have entered into various agreements with DISH Network. Pursuant to certain agreements, DISH Network provides us certain professional services, for which we pay DISH Network an amount equal to DISH Network\u2019s cost plus a fixed margin. Certain other intercompany agreements cover matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by DISH Network for certain of our businesses. We have also entered into certain commercial agreements with DISH Network. The terms of certain of these agreements were established while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network and were not the result of arm\u2019s length negotiations.

DISH Network retains its interests in various companies that have subsidiaries or controlled affiliates that own or operate domestic or foreign services that may compete with services offered by our businesses. In addition, pursuant to a distribution agreement, DISH Network has the right, but not the obligation, to market, sell and distribute our Hughes segment\u2019s satellite broadband internet service under the dishNET brand which could compete with sales by our Hughes segment. DISH Network also has a distribution agreement with ViaSat, a competitor of our Hughes segment, to sell services similar to those offered by our Hughes segment. We may also compete with DISH Network when we participate in auctions for spectrum or orbital slots for our satellites.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts of interest with DISH Network and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nExcept for certain arrangements with Sling TV Holding L.L.C. (\u201cSling TV Holding,\u201d formerly DISH Digital Holding L.L.C.) that we entered into with DISH Network, which, subject to certain exceptions, limits DISH Network\u2019s and our ability to operate an internet protocol television (\u201cIPTV\u201d) service other than that operated by Sling TV Holding, we do not have any agreements not to compete with DISH Network. However, many of our potential customers who compete with DISH Network have historically perceived us as a competitor due to our affiliation with DISH Network. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into any commercial relationships with potential customers who are competitors of DISH Network (particularly if we continue to be perceived as affiliated with DISH Network as a result of common ownership, certain shared management services and other arrangements with DISH Network).\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders, because of our capital structure.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\na capital structure with multiple classes of common stock: a Class A that entitles the holders to one vote per share; a Class B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share; a Class C that entitles the holders to one vote per share, except upon a change in control of our company in which case the holders of Class C are entitled to ten votes per share and a non-voting Class D; and, if the Share Exchange is not consummated, a class of preferred stock, the Hughes Retail Tracking Stock, that entitles the holders to one-tenth of one vote per share;\n\u2022\na provision that authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\na provision limiting who may call special meetings of shareholders; and\n\u2022\na provision establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nIn addition, Charles W. Ergen owns a majority of our common stock, including Class B common stock, which results in Mr. Ergen having the power to elect all of our directors and control shareholder decision on matters on which all classes of our common stock vote together.\nIn addition, pursuant to our articles of incorporation we have a significant amount of authorized and unissued stock that would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nThe preferred tracking stock in our capital structure may create conflicts of interest for our board of directors and management, and our board of directors may make decisions that could adversely affect only one group of holders.\nIf the Share Exchange is not consummated, our preferred tracking stock capital structure could give rise to occasions when the interests of holders of stock of one group might diverge or appear to diverge from the interests of holders of stock of the other group and our board of directors or officers could make decisions that could adversely affect only one group of holders. Nevada law requires that our board of directors and officers act in good faith and with a view to the interest of the company and are not required to consider, as a dominant factor, the effect of a proposed corporate action upon any particular group of stockholders. Decisions deemed to be in the interest of our company may not always align with the best interest of a particular group of our stockholders when considered independently. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the terms of any business relationships that may be created between the EchoStar Group and the Hughes Retail Group and the terms of any reattributions of assets between the groups;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the groups, especially where the opportunities might meet the strategic business objectives of both groups;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one group but beneficial to the other;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to either of our groups;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the payment of dividends on our common stock or preferred tracking stock; and\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the disposition of assets of either of our groups.\nIn addition, as our preferred tracking stock is currently held by DISH Network, if the Share Exchange is not consummated questions relating to conflicts of interest may also arise between DISH Network and us due to our common ownership and Chairman. Provisions of Nevada law and our articles of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors and officers that have a disparate impact on one group of holders. Our stockholders may have limited or no legal remedies under Nevada law with respect to such decisions even if the actions of our directors or officers adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nIf the Share Exchange is not consummated, our board of directors has the ability to change our attribution policies at any time without a vote of our common stockholders.\nOur board of directors has adopted the Policy Statement. Our board of directors may at any time change or make exceptions to the Policy Statement with only the consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our preferred tracking stock. Because these policies relate to matters concerning the day-to-day management of our company as opposed to significant corporate actions, such as a merger involving the Company or a sale of substantially all of our assets, no approval from the holders of our Class A common stock is required with respect to the changes or exceptions to these policies. A decision to change, or make exceptions to the Policy Statement or adopt additional policies could disadvantage one group of shareholders while advantaging another.\nIf the Share Exchange is not consummated, the preferred tracking stock results in, and may result in further, vote dilution for existing holders of common stock.\nEach share of preferred tracking stock is entitled to one-tenth (1/10th) of one vote per share. This voting right will cause a reduction in the relative voting power of our exiting common stock holders. Additionally, if the Share Exchange is not consummated, we may be required to register some or all of the outstanding shares of the preferred tracking stock. Following such registration, these shares of preferred tracking stock may be converted or exchanged into shares of EchoStar Class A common stock. Such conversion may result in further reducing the relative voting power of our existing common stock holders. As a result of the dilutive effect of the preferred tracking stock, the ability of existing holders of common stock to elect our directors or to control all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders may be reduced.\nWe generally may dispose of assets of the Hughes Retail Group without shareholder approval.\nNevada law requires stockholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, taken as a whole, and our amended articles of incorporation do not require a separate class vote in the case of a sale of a significant amount of assets of any of our groups. As long as the assets attributed to the Hughes Retail Group proposed to be disposed of represent less than substantially all of our assets, we may approve sales and other dispositions of any amounts of the assets of such group without any shareholder approval. Based on the current composition of the Hughes Retail Group and our Company, if the Share Exchange is not consummated, we believe that a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Hughes Retail Group would not be considered a sale of substantially all of our assets requiring stockholder approval. Our board of directors would determine how best to proceed in any such sale consistent with its fiduciary duties to all of our shareholders. Ultimately, however, our board of directors is not required under Nevada law to select the option that would result in the highest value to any particular group of stockholders.\nIf the Share Exchange is not consummated, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected by events involving the assets and businesses attributed to only the Hughes Retail Group.\nBecause we are the issuer of common stock and preferred tracking stock, events relating to the assets and businesses attributed to the Hughes Retail Group, such as earnings announcements or announcements of new products or services, or acquisitions or dispositions that the market does not view favorably, may cause an adverse reaction to our common stock. This could occur even if the triggering event is not material to us as a whole.\nOur articles of incorporation designate the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County of the State of Nevada as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County of the State of Nevada will be the sole and exclusive forum for any and all actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, administrative or investigative or that asserts any claim or counterclaim brought in our name or on our behalf, asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, arising or asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Nevada Restated Statutes Chapters 78 or 92A, our articles of incorporation or our bylaws, interpreting, applying, enforcing or determining the validity of our articles of incorporation or bylaws or asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our articles of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring certain claims, including claims against our directors, officers or employees, in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable and therefore the choice of forum provision may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Nevada. The Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our articles of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance.\nThe FASB is currently working together with the International Accounting Standards Board to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow GAAP and those that are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards. In connection with this initiative, the FASB issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition and accounting for leases. For information regarding new accounting standards, please refer to Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report under the heading \u201cNew Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d These and other such standards may result in different accounting principles, which may\nsignificantly impact our reported results or could result in volatility of our financial results. In addition, we may need to significantly change our customer and vendor contracts, accounting systems and processes. The cost and effect of these changes may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may face other risks described from time to time in periodic and current reports we file with the SEC.", "PERMNO": 92469, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "SATS"}
