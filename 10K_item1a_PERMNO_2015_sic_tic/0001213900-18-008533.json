{"cik": "1681941", "company": "iFresh Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-06-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Common Stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, before deciding to invest in our Common Stock. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect iFresh\u2019s business, prospects, sales, revenues, gross profit, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are currently in default under our Credit Facility with Key Bank, which limits our liquidity and could result in Key Bank accelerating amounts we owe to it under the facility.\nOn December 23, 2016, NYM, as borrower, entered into a $25 million senior secured Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Key Bank National Association (\u201cKey Bank\u201d or \u201cLender\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for (1) a revolving credit of $5,000,000 for making advance and issuance of letter of credit, (2) $15,000,000 of effective date term loan and (3) $5,000,000 of delayed draw term loan. The interest rate is equal to (1) the Lender\u2019s \u201cprime rate\u201d plus 0.95%, or (b) the Adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.95%. Although the Company has been repaying the Key Bank facility in accordance with its terms, the Company failed to timely pay taxes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,187,693, which resulted in a tax lien being imposed upon the Company by the IRS on June 11, 2018 in the amount of $1,236,831.08. Due to these outstanding taxes owed and the tax lien, the Company is currently in default under the Credit Agreement. We have advised Key Bank of the default, and while Key Bank has not yet acted to accelerate payment of the facility, Key Bank does consider us to be in default and will not make any further advances under the Credit Facility until we comply with our obligations under the Credit Agreement. Our inability to draw down amounts under the credit facility significantly impairs the Company\u2019s growth plans and limits its liquidity. In addition, if Key Bank were to decide to accelerate repayment of the Credit Facility, our financial condition and results of operation would be negatively impacted. By June 29, 2018, the Company had paid the full amount of the outstanding IRS obligation. Although the Company anticipates being able to obtain a waiver from Key Bank regarding the Company\u2019s default, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so.\nThere is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we incurred operating losses, did not meet the financial covenant required in the Credit Agreement and are currently in default of the Credit Agreement due to our failure to pay certain tax obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\niFresh\u2019s continued growth depends on new store acquisitions and openings and on increasing same store sales, and iFresh\u2019s failure to achieve these goals could negatively impact its results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends, in large part, on acquiring and opening new stores in existing and new areas and operating those stores successfully. Successful implementation of this strategy is dependent on sufficient capital support from financing, finding suitable stores to acquire, identifying suitable locations and negotiating acceptable lease terms for store sites, as it faces competition from other retailers for such sites. There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through new store acquisitions and openings. We may not be able to obtain sufficient capital support for the expansion plan, or successfully implement the plan to acquire or open new stores timely or within budget or operate them successfully, and there can be no assurance that store acquisition or opening costs for, net sales of, contribution margin of and average payback period on initial investment for new stores will conform to our operating model discussed elsewhere in this report. Lower contribution margins from new stores, along with the impact of related store acquisition, opening and store management relocation costs, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we acquire stores in the future, it may not be able to successfully integrate those stores into its existing store base and those stores may not be as profitable as its existing stores.\nAlso, we may not be able to successfully hire, train and retain new store employees or integrate those employees into the programs, policies and culture of us. We or our third party vendors may not be able to adapt our distribution, management and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores at competitive prices so that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner. We may not have the level of cash flow or financing necessary to support our growth strategy.\nAdditionally, our acquisition and opening of new stores will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause the Company to operate its existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our existing stores. If the Company experiences a decline in performance, it may slow or discontinue store openings, or may decide to close stores that it is unable to operate in a profitable manner.\nAdditionally, some of our new stores may be located in areas where the Company has little experience or a lack of brand recognition. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause these new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets.\nOur operating results and stock price will be adversely affected if we fail to implement our growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful.\nOur newly opened stores may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term and may not achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our mature store base on a timely basis or at all.\nThe Company has actively pursued new store growth and plans to continue doing so in the future. The Company cannot assure you that its new store acquisitions or openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability. New store openings may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term due to the effect of store opening costs and lower sales and contribution margin during the initial period following opening. New stores build their sales volume and their customer base over time and, as a result, generally have lower margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, than our more mature stores. A new store can take more than a year to achieve a level of operating performance comparable to our similarly existing stores. Further, we have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, some sales volume transfer from our existing stores to our new stores as some of our existing customers switch to new, closer locations. As a result, part of the increase of the overall sales to us arising from a new store opening or a store acquisition may be offset by the \u201csales volume transfer\u201d phenomena.\nThe competition from competitors may increase intensively in the future.\nFood retail is a large and highly competitive industry. However, iFresh believes that the market participants in the Chinese supermarket industry are highly fragmented and immature. Currently, iFresh faces competition from smaller or dispersed competitors focusing on the niche market of Chinese consumers. However, with the rapid growth of the Chinese and other Asian population and their consumption power, other competitors may also begin operating in this niche market in the future. Those competitors include: (i) national conventional supermarkets, (ii) regional supermarkets, (iii) national superstores, (iv) alternative food retailers, (v) local foods stores, (vi) small specialty stores, and (vii) farmers\u2019 markets.\nThe national and regional supermarket chains are experienced in operating multiple stores locations, expanding management and they have greater marketing or financial resources than iFresh does. Even though they currently offer only a limited selection of Chinese and Asian specialty foods, they may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products if they choose to do so. On the contrary, the local food stores and markets are small in size with a deep understanding of local preferences, but their lack of scale results in high risk and limited growth potential.\nIf more and more competitors devote into this market segment aiming to serve Chinese and other Asian customers in the future, the competition will increase. Our operating results may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, reduction in margin from competitive price changes and/or greater operating costs such as marketing, due to the increase of competition.\niFresh relies on a combination of product offerings, customer service, store format, location and pricing to compete.\niFresh competes with other food retailers on a combination of factors, primarily product selection and quality, customer service, store layout and decoration, location and price. Our success depends on its ability to offer products that appeal to its customers\u2019 preferences. Failure to offer such products, or to accurately forecast changing customer preferences, could lead to a decrease in the number of customer transactions at Our stores and in the amount customers spend at our stores.\nPricing in particular is a significant driver of consumer choice in Our industry and iFresh expects competitors to continue to apply pricing and other competitive pressures. To the extent that Our competitors lower prices, its ability to maintain gross profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted. Some of Our competitors may have greater resources than it does. These competitors could use these advantages to take measures, including reducing prices, which could adversely affect Our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf iFresh does not succeed in offering attractively priced products that consumers intend to purchase or are unable to provide a convenient and appealing shopping experience, Our sales, operating margins and market share may decrease, resulting in reduced profitability.\nEconomic conditions that impact consumer spending could materially affect our business.\nOngoing economic uncertainty continues to negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending. iFresh\u2019s operating results may be materially affected by changes in economic conditions nationwide or in the regions in which iFresh operates that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. This risk may be exacerbated if customers choose lower-cost alternatives to iFresh\u2019s product offerings in response to economic conditions. In particular, a decrease in discretionary spending could adversely impact sales of certain of iFresh\u2019s higher margin product offerings. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of consumer credit, interest rates, tax rates and fuel and energy costs, could reduce overall consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors. In addition, inflation or deflation can impact iFresh\u2019s business. Food deflation could reduce sales growth and earnings, while food inflation, combined with reduced consumer spending, could reduce gross profit margins. As a result, iFresh\u2019s results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nFresh\u2019s existing stores are mainly located in Northeastern American metropolitan areas. The geographic concentration of its stores creates an exposure to the economy of the Northeastern United States and any downturn in this region could materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPerishable products make up a significant portion of iFresh\u2019s sales, and ordering errors or product supply disruptions may have an adverse effect on iFresh\u2019s profitability and operating results.\niFresh has a significant focus on perishable products. Sales of perishable products accounted for approximately 64% of iFresh\u2019s net sales in fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. iFresh has self-owned wholesale facilities and stable supply relationship with farm partners, which significantly reduces ordering errors and product disruption. However, iFresh still relies on various suppliers and vendors to provide and deliver its product inventory on a continuous basis. iFresh could suffer significant perishable product inventory losses in the event of the loss of a major supplier or vendor, disruption of its supply chain, extended power outages, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences. While iFresh has implemented certain systems to ensure that its ordering is in line with demand, it cannot assure you that its ordering systems will always work efficiently, in particular in connection with the new additional stores, which have no, or a limited, ordering history. If iFresh were to over-order, it could suffer inventory losses, which would negatively impact its operating results.\nInterruption of exclusive distribution of brands or imports relating to iFresh\u2019s wholesale operations may adversely impact iFresh\u2019s financial conditions and operating results.\niFresh conducts wholesale business through its two subsidiaries, Strong America and NYMG, which enables iFresh to have stronger negotiating power with vendors as well as a way to source products from China, Thailand and Taiwan to its own retail stores. Strong America is also the exclusive distributor of nine famous oversea brands. If iFresh can\u2019t renew its exclusive distribution contracts relating to those brands, iFresh\u2019s sales, both retail and wholesale, may be adversely affected. Furthermore, importing products from other countries is subject to the impact of various international factors, including international trading policies, shipping costs, currency fluctuations, tariffs and customs procedures for imports, which may affect the supply and purchase prices of the products to be imported by iFresh\u2019s wholesale distributors and sold by them to iFresh. If iFresh fails to obtain or maintain a sustainable supply of these products from its vendors, its financial conditions and operating results will be adversely impacted.\nThe operation of new stores and online sales may cannibalize sales in iFresh\u2019s stores and its financial results can be affected by economic and competitive conditions in this area.\nAll of iFresh\u2019s existing stores are located in the Northeastern United States and it intends to grow its store base in this area. New stores are expected to be opened in the Greater New York City and Boston metropolitan areas. As iFresh opens new stores in closer proximity to its customers who currently travel longer distances to shop at iFresh\u2019s stores, iFresh expects some of these customers to take advantage of the convenience of iFresh\u2019s new locations. Simultaneously, iFresh will develop online sales to cover the customers living in a 2.5-hour drive radius, which may satisfy the demand from those Chinese customers living in the suburbs.\nSome sales volume may transfer from iFresh\u2019s existing stores to its new stores as some of its existing customers switch to these new, closer locations, or convenient online shopping. Consequently, iFresh\u2019s new stores and online sales may adversely impact sales at iFresh\u2019s existing stores.\nDisruption of relationships with vendors could negatively affect iFresh\u2019s business.\niFresh purchases vegetables and fruits directly from farms and other vendors and maintains stable relationships with the vendors to ensure reliable supplies of popular seasonal Chinese specialty of vegetables and fruits. iFresh also depends on third-party suppliers for exclusive third-party brands. The cancellation of iFresh\u2019s supply arrangement with any of its suppliers or the disruption, delay or inability in supply from its suppliers could adversely affect iFresh\u2019s sales. If iFresh\u2019s suppliers fail to comply with food safety or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted. iFresh cannot assure you that it would be able to find replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms.\niFresh may be unable to protect or maintain its intellectual property, which could result in customer confusion, a negative perception of its brand and adversely affect its business.\niFresh believes that its intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of iFresh\u2019s business. In particular, iFresh\u2019s trademarks, including New York Mart, are valuable assets that reinforce iFresh\u2019s customers\u2019 favorable perception of its stores.\nFrom time to time, third parties have used names similar to iFresh\u2019s, have applied to register trademarks similar to iFresh\u2019s and, as iFresh believes, have infringed or misappropriated iFresh\u2019s intellectual property rights. iFresh responds to these actions on a case-by-case basis, including, where appropriate, by sending cease and desist letters and commencing opposition actions and litigation. The outcomes of these actions have included both negotiated out-of-court settlements as well as litigation. iFresh cannot assure you that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property rights are adequate, that its intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, iFresh\u2019s trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect iFresh\u2019s trademark rights could prevent iFresh in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to iFresh\u2019s trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect consumers\u2019 perception of iFresh\u2019s brand and products, and eventually adversely affect iFresh\u2019s sales and profitability. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether iFresh is successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject iFresh to liabilities, force iFresh to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force iFresh to enter into licenses with others. Any one of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on iFresh\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf iFresh experiences a data security breach and confidential customer information is disclosed, iFresh may be subject to penalties and experience negative publicity, which could affect iFresh\u2019s customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its business.\niFresh and its customers could suffer harm if customer information was accessed by third parties due to a security failure in iFresh\u2019s systems. The collection of data and processing of transactions requires iFresh to receive, transmit and store a large amount of personally identifiable and transaction related data. This type of data is subject to legislation and regulation in various jurisdictions. Recently, data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting state and federal legislative proposals addressing data privacy and security. If some of the current proposals are adopted, iFresh may be subject to more extensive requirements to protect the customer information that it processes in connection with the purchases of iFresh\u2019s products. iFresh may become exposed to potential liability with respect to the data that it collects, manages and processes, and may incur legal costs if its information security policies and procedures are not effective or if it is required to defend its methods of collection, processing and storage of personal data. Future investigations, lawsuits or adverse publicity relating to iFresh\u2019s methods of handling personal data could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to the costs and negative market reaction relating to such developments. Additionally, if iFresh suffers data breaches, one or more of the credit card processing companies that it relies on may refuse to allow it to continue to participate in their network, which would limit iFresh\u2019s ability to accept credit cards at its stores and could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nData theft, information espionage or other criminal activity directed at the retail industry or computer or communications systems may materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s business by causing iFresh to implement costly security measures in recognition of actual or potential threats, by requiring iFresh to expend significant time and expense developing, maintaining or upgrading its information technology systems and by causing it to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages. Such activities may also materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by reducing consumer confidence in the marketplace and by modifying consumer spending habits.\nIf iFresh is unable to renew or replace current store leases or if it is unable to enter into leases for additional stores on favorable terms, or if one or more of its current leases are terminated prior to expiration of their stated term, and it cannot find suitable alternate locations, iFresh\u2019s growth and profitability could be negatively impacted.\niFresh currently leases all of its store locations. Many of iFresh\u2019s current leases provide unilateral option to renew for several additional rental periods at specific rental rates. iFresh\u2019s ability to re-negotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or to negotiate favorable terms for a suitable alternate location, and iFresh\u2019s ability to negotiate favorable lease terms for additional store locations, could depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties, its relationships with current and prospective landlords, or other factors that are not within iFresh\u2019s control. Any or all of these factors and conditions could negatively impact iFresh\u2019s growth and profitability.\niFresh leases certain of its stores and related properties from related parties.\nLong Deng, one of iFresh\u2019s directors and executive officers, owns 50% of Dragon Development LLC, which leases to iFresh the premises at which Strong America, one of iFresh\u2019s wholesale subsidiaries, is located. During fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, rental payments (excluding maintenance and taxes that iFresh is obligated to pay) under the leases from Dragon Development LLC were $637,273. The leases with Dragon Development LLC renewed on May 1, 2016, and their remaining terms are 10 years. iFresh has no assurance that these related parties will renew the lease agreements with it after expiration. If iFresh cannot renew the leases, it will have to move its stores and warehouses locations, which increases the uncertainty of finding suitable locations for those stores and the reputation recognition in new locations, which may adversely affect iFresh\u2019s sales, expenses, profit and financial position.\nFailure to retain iFresh\u2019s senior management and other key personnel may adversely affect its operations.\niFresh\u2019s success is substantially dependent on the continued service of its senior management and other key personnel. These executives, and in particular Long Deng, iFresh\u2019s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of iFresh\u2019s business and for executing its growth strategy and are integral to its brand and culture, and the reputation iFresh enjoys with suppliers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on iFresh\u2019s business and prospects, as iFresh may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause iFresh\u2019s stock price to decline. The loss of key employees could negatively affect iFresh\u2019s business.\nIf iFresh is unable to attract, train and retain employees, it may not be able to grow or successfully operate its business.\nThe retail store industry is labor intensive, and iFresh\u2019s success depends in part upon its ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate iFresh\u2019s culture and are able to represent its brand effectively and establish credibility with its business partners and consumers. iFresh\u2019s ability to meet its labor needs, while controlling wage and labor-related costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the workforce in the markets in which iFresh is located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. In the event of increasing wage rates, if iFresh fails to increase its wages competitively, the quality of its workforce could decline, causing its customer service to suffer, while increasing its wages could cause its earnings to decrease. If iFresh is unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting its business needs and expectations, its business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet iFresh\u2019s staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of iFresh\u2019s employees may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in and enforcement of immigration laws could increase iFresh\u2019s costs and adversely affect iFresh\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified store-level employees.\nFederal and state governments from time to time implement immigration laws, regulations or programs that regulate iFresh\u2019s ability to attract or retain qualified foreign employees. Some of these changes may increase iFresh\u2019s obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject iFresh to additional costs and make iFresh\u2019s hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although iFresh has implemented, and is in the process of enhancing, procedures to ensure its compliance with the employment eligibility verification requirements, there can be no assurance that these procedures are adequate and some of its employees may, without iFresh\u2019s knowledge, be unauthorized workers. The employment of unauthorized workers may subject iFresh to fines or civil or criminal penalties, and if any of iFresh\u2019s workers are found to be unauthorized, iFresh could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts its brand and makes it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. iFresh may be required to terminate the employment of certain of its employees who were determined to be unauthorized workers. The termination of a significant number of employees may disrupt iFresh\u2019s operations, cause temporary increases in iFresh\u2019s labor costs as it trains new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. iFresh\u2019s financial performance could be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.\nProlonged labor disputes with employees and increases in labor costs could adversely affect iFresh\u2019s business.\nA considerable amount of iFresh\u2019s operating costs is attributable to labor costs and, therefore, its financial performance is greatly influenced by increases in wage and benefit costs, including pension and health care costs. As a result, iFresh is exposed to risks associated with a competitive labor market. Rising health care and pension costs and the nature and structure of work rules will be important issues. Any work stoppages or labor disturbances as a result of employees\u2019 dissatisfaction of their current employment terms could have a material adverse effect on iFresh\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. iFresh also expects that in the event of a work stoppage or labor disturbance, it could incur additional costs and face increased competition.\nVarious aspects of iFresh\u2019s business are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. iFresh\u2019s compliance with these regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could materially adversely affect its ability to conduct its business as planned.\niFresh is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, environmental protection, workplace safety, food safety, public health, community right-to-know and alcoholic beverage and tobacco sales. In particular, the states in which iFresh operates and several local jurisdictions regulate the licensing of supermarkets and the sale of alcoholic beverages. In addition, certain local regulations may limit iFresh\u2019s ability to sell alcoholic beverages at certain times. iFresh is also subject to laws governing its relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, immigration, disabled access and work permit requirements. Compliance with new laws in these areas, or with new or stricter interpretations of existing requirements, could reduce the revenue and profitability of iFresh\u2019s stores and could otherwise materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. iFresh\u2019s new store openings could be delayed or prevented or its existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in iFresh\u2019s ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. iFresh\u2019s stores are subject to unscheduled inspections on a regular basis, which, if violations are found, could result in the assessment of fines, suspension of one or more needed licenses and, in the case of repeated \u201ccritical\u201d violations, closure of the store until a re-inspection demonstrates that iFresh has remediated the problem. Certain of iFresh\u2019s parking lots and warehouses either have only temporary certificates of occupancy or are awaiting a certificate of occupancy which, if not granted, would require iFresh to stop using such property. Additionally, a number of federal, state and local laws impose requirements or restrictions on business owners with respect to access by disabled persons. iFresh\u2019s compliance with these laws may result in modifications to iFresh\u2019s properties, or prevent iFresh from performing certain further renovations. iFresh cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on iFresh\u2019s business in the future.\niFresh\u2019s plans to acquire and open new stores requires iFresh to spend capital. Failure to use its capital efficiently could have an adverse effect on iFresh\u2019s profitability.\niFresh\u2019s growth strategy depends on its acquisition of and opening new stores, which will require iFresh to use cash generated by its operations and a portion of the net proceeds of future equity or debt financing and borrowing under bank credit line. iFresh cannot assure you that cash generated by its operations, the net proceeds of future equity or debt financing and borrowing under bank credit line will be sufficient to allow iFresh to implement its growth strategy. If any of these initiatives prove to be unsuccessful, iFresh may experience reduced profitability and it could be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate planned store openings, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and future operating performance and the price of its common stock.\nLitigation may materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\niFresh\u2019s operations are characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and by transactions involving a wide variety of product selections. These operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in many other industries. Consequently, iFresh may be a party to individual personal injury, product liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of its business, including litigation arising from food-related illness. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in iFresh\u2019s businesses, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether iFresh is ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased commodity prices and availability may impact profitability.\nMany of iFresh\u2019s products include ingredients such as wheat, corn, oils, milk, sugar, cocoa and other commodities. Commodity prices worldwide have been increasing. While commodity price inputs do not typically represent the substantial majority of iFresh\u2019s product costs, any increase in commodity prices may cause its vendors to seek price increases from iFresh. Although iFresh is typically able to mitigate vendor efforts to increase its costs, it may be unable to continue to do so, either in whole or in part. In the event iFresh is unable to continue mitigating potential vendor price increases, it may in turn consider raising its prices, and its customers may be deterred by any such price increases. iFresh\u2019s profitability may be impacted through increased costs to it which may impact gross margins, or through reduced revenue as a result of a decline in the number and average size of customer transactions.\nSevere weather, natural disasters and adverse climate changes may materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather conditions and other natural disasters in areas where iFresh has stores or from which iFresh obtains the products it sells may materially adversely affect its retail operations or its product offerings and, therefore, its results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to, or temporary or permanent closure of, one or more of iFresh\u2019s stores, an insufficient workforce in iFresh\u2019s markets and/or temporary disruption in the supply of products, including delays in the delivery of goods to iFresh\u2019s stores or a reduction in the availability of products in its stores. In addition, adverse climate conditions and adverse weather patterns, such as drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops may materially adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within its supply chain. Any of these factors may disrupt iFresh\u2019s businesses and materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe occurrence of a widespread health epidemic may materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\niFresh\u2019s business may be severely impacted by wartime activities, threats or acts of terror or a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic, such as pandemic flu. Such activities, threats or epidemics may materially adversely impact iFresh\u2019s business by disrupting production and delivery of products to iFresh\u2019s stores, by affecting iFresh\u2019s ability to appropriately staff its stores or by causing customers to avoid public gathering places or otherwise change their shopping behaviors.\niFresh needs approximately $50 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 in order to achieve its planned growth for that year and if it cannot successfully obtain sufficient capital, the financial results and stock price of iFresh after the business combination will be adversely affected.\niFresh believes that it needs approximately $50 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 mainly for the purpose of acquiring additional stores to achieve its planned growth for that year. If it is not able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms in connection with the Business Combination, as is contemplated by the parties, it may not be able to implement its growth plan. If it is unable to affect its growth plan, iFresh\u2019s financial results will be significantly worse than anticipated and its stock price may decline as a result.\niFresh is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make its securities less attractive to investors.\niFresh is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. It may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. However, if its non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or the market value of its common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, iFresh would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, iFresh is not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, has reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and is exempt from the requirements of holding a non binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth company, iFresh has elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, iFresh\u2019s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. As a result, potential investors may be less likely to invest in our securities.", "PERMNO": 16590, "SIC": 5411, "TIC": "IFMK"}
