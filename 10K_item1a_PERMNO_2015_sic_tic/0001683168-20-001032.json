{"cik": "1355848", "company": "Genius Brands International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on Page of this Form 10-K.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nCoronavirus (COVID-19)\nWith respect to the ongoing and evolving coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was designated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, the outbreak has caused substantial disruption in international and U.S. economies and markets. The outbreak has potential to have an adverse impact on the entertainment industry and, if repercussions of the outbreak are prolonged, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, which could be material. The Company\u2019s management cannot at this point estimate the impact of the outbreak on it\u2019s business and no provision for this outbreak are reflected in the accompanying financial statements.\nWe have incurred net losses since inception.\nWe have a history of operating losses and incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated net revenues of $5,907,899 and incurred a net loss of $11,481,245, while for the previous year, we generated net revenue of $993,452 and incurred a net loss of $9,003,901. These losses, among other things, have had an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, stockholders\u2019 equity, net current assets and working capital.\nWe will need to generate additional revenue and/or reduce costs to achieve profitability. We are beginning to generate revenues derived from our existing properties, properties in production, and new brands being introduced into the marketplace. However, the ability to sustain these revenues and generate significant additional revenues or achieve profitability will depend upon numerous factors some of which are outside of our control.\nWe will need additional financing to continue our operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we will need to curtail or cease our development plans and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $305,000 of available cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Following various financings during the first quarter of 2020, as of March 28, 2020, we had approximately $2.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. Additional funds may be required to fund operations and repay our outstanding debt which could be raised through the issuance of equity securities and/or debt financing. There is no assurance that any type of financing on terms acceptable to us will be available or will otherwise occur. Debt financing must be repaid regardless of whether we generate revenues or cash flows from operations and may be secured by substantially all of our assets. Any equity financing or debt financing that requires the issuance of warrants or other equity securities to the lender would cause the percentage ownership by our current stockholders to be diluted, which dilution may be substantial. Also, any additional equity securities issued may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we obtain stockholder approval, any equity financing at a price below the then current conversion price of our March 2020 Secured Convertible Notes or the exercise price of the March 2020 Warrants will result in an adjustment to the conversion price or exercise price applicable to such securities, resulting in the potential issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon the conversion or exercise of such securities, which would further dilute our other stockholders.\nIf we are not able to obtain sufficient capital, we may then be forced to limit the scope of our operations.\nWe expect that as our business continues to evolve, we will need additional working capital. If adequate additional debt and/or equity financing is not available on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to continue to expand our business, and we will have to modify our business plans accordingly. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and our financial condition.\nIf we reach a point where we are unable to raise needed additional funds to continue as a going concern, we could be forced to cease our activities and dissolve our company. In such an event, we will need to satisfy various creditors and other claimants, severance, lease termination and other dissolution-related obligations.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period.\nCash flow and projections for any entertainment company producing original content can be expected to fluctuate until the animated content and ancillary consumer products are in the market and could fluctuate thereafter even when the content and products are in the marketplace. There is significant lead time in developing and producing animated content before that content is in the marketplace. Unanticipated delays in entertainment production can delay the release of the content into the marketplace. Structured retail windows that dictate when new products can be introduced at retail are also out of our control. While we believe that we have mitigated this in part by creating a slate of properties at various stages of development or production as well as representing certain established brands which contribute immediately to cash flow, any delays in the production and release of our content and products or any changes in the preferences of our customers could result in lower than anticipated cash flows.\nAs with our cash flows, our revenues and results of operations depend significantly upon the appeal of our content to our customers, the timing of releases of our products and the commercial success of our products, none of which can be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period. The results of one period may not be indicative of the results of any future period. Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. This could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate.\nProduction cost will be amortized according to the individual film forecasting methodology. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue, we would be required to adjust amortization of related production costs. These adjustments would adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the United States, global or regional economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nA decrease in economic activity in the United States or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. A decline in economic conditions could reduce demand for and sales of our products. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the animated content and consumer products we offer, which could also decrease our revenues, increase our costs, or both.\nInaccurately anticipating changes and trends in popular culture, media and movies, fashion, or technology can negatively affect our sales.\nWhile trends in the toddler to tween sector change quickly, we respond to trends and developments by modifying, refreshing, extending, and expanding our product offerings on an on-going basis. However, we operate in extremely competitive industries where the ultimate appeal and popularity of content and products targeted to this sector can be difficult to predict. We believe our focus on \u201ccontent with a purpose\u201d serves an underrepresented area of the toddler to tween market; however, if the interest of our audience trends away from our current properties toward other offerings based on current media, movies, animated content or characters, and if we fail to accurately anticipate trends in popular culture, movies, media, fashion, or technology, our products may not be accepted by children, parents, or families and our revenues, profitability, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe face competition from a variety of retailers that sell similar merchandise and have better resources than we do.\nThe industries in which we operate are competitive, and our results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, competitive pricing, promotional pressures, additional competitor offerings and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Indirectly through our licensing arrangements, we compete for retailers as well as other outlets for the sale and promotion of our licensed merchandise. Our primary competition comes from competitors such as The Walt Disney Company, Nickelodeon Studios, and the Cartoon Network.\nWe have sought a competitive advantage by providing \u201ccontent with a purpose\u201d which are both entertaining and enriching for children and offer differentiated value that parents seek in making purchasing decisions for their children. While we do not believe that this value proposition is specifically offered by our competitors, our competitors have greater financial resources and more developed marketing channels than we do which could impact our ability, through our licensees, to secure shelf space thereby decreasing our revenues or affecting our profitability and results of operations.\nThe production of our animated content is accomplished through third-party production and animation studios around the world, and any failure of these third-parties could negatively impact our business.\nAs part of our business model to manage cash flows, we have partnered with a number of third-party production and animation studios around the world for the production of our new content in which these partners fund the production of the content in exchange for a portion of revenues generated in certain territories. We are reliant on our partners to produce and deliver the content on a timely basis meeting the predetermined specifications for that product. The delivery of inferior content could result in additional expenditures by us to correct any problems to ensure marketability. Further, delays in the delivery of the finished content to us could result in our failure to deliver the product to broadcasters to which it has been pre-licensed. While we believe we have mitigated this risk by aligning the economic interests of our partners with ours and managing the production process remotely on a daily basis, any failures or delays from our production partners could negatively affect our profitability.\nWe cannot assure you that our original programming content will appeal to our distributors and viewers or that any of our original programming content will not be cancelled or removed from our distributors\u2019 platforms.\nOur business depends on the appeal of our content to distributors and viewers, which is difficult to predict. Our business depends in part upon viewer preferences and audience acceptance of our original programming content. These factors are difficult to predict and are subject to influences beyond our control, such as the quality and appeal of competing programming, general economic conditions and the availability of other entertainment activities. We may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in markets. A change in viewer preferences could cause our original programming content to decline in popularity, which could jeopardize renewal of agreements with distributors. Low ratings or viewership for programming content produced by us may lead to the cancellation, removal or non-renewal of a program and can negatively affect future license fees for such program. If our original programming content does not gain the level of audience acceptance we expect, or if we are unable to maintain the popularity of our original programming, we may have a diminished negotiating position when dealing with distributors, which could reduce our revenue. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the success of any of our current original programming content or generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for new original programming content in the future. This could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may be required to pay significant penalties if we are not able to meet our obligations under our outstanding registration rights agreements.\nWe have entered into registration rights agreements in connection with certain of our securities offerings. We may be obligated to pay liquidated damages if we do not meet our obligations under those agreements.\nIf we are required to pay significant amounts, such as the liquidated damages described above, under these or future registration rights agreements, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to finance our operations.\nFailure to successfully market or advertise our products could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Our ability to sell products is dependent in part upon the success of these programs. If we or our licensees do not successfully market our products or if media or other advertising or promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe failure of others to promote our products may adversely affect our business.\nThe availability of retailer programs relating to product placement, co-op advertising and market development funds, and our ability and willingness to pay for such programs, are important with respect to promoting our properties. In addition, although we may have agreements for the advertising and promotion of our products through our licensees, we will not be in direct control of those marketing efforts and those efforts may not be done in a manner that will maximize sales of our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological advances.\nThe entertainment industry in general, and the music and motion picture industries in particular, continue to undergo significant changes, primarily due to technological developments. Because of the rapid growth of technology, shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment, it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on potential revenue from, and profitability of, distributing entertainment programming. As it is also impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on our ability to compete effectively in a changing market, if we are not able to keep pace with these technological advances, our revenues, profitability and results from operations may be materially adversely affected.\nFailure in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.\nOur ability to execute our business plan and maintain operations depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. IT systems are vulnerable to risks and damages from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our and our vendors\u2019 servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If our computer systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, litigation and enforcement actions, and we could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm our business. Despite precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption and cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future collaborators and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we do not believe that we have experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could adversely affect our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of such information could result in legal claims or proceedings and damage our reputation.\nLoss of key personnel may adversely affect our business.\nOur success greatly depends on the performance of our executive management team, including Andy Heyward, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of any member of our core executive management team or other key persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur management team currently owns a substantial interest in our voting stock.\nAs of March 29, 2019, our management team and Board of Directors beneficially own or control (including conversions, options or warrants exercisable or convertible within 60 days) a combined 3,436,505 shares or 11.24-%, of our shares currently outstanding (including conversions, options or warrants exercisable or convertible within 60 days). Sales of significant amounts of shares held by our directors and executive officers, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, management has the ability to control any proposals submitted to shareholders, including corporate actions and board changes which may not be in accordance with the votes of other shareholders.\nLitigation may harm our business or otherwise distract management.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and could distract management. For example, lawsuits by licensors, consumers, employees or stockholders could be very costly and disrupt business. While disputes from time to time are not uncommon, we may not be able to resolve such disputes on terms favorable to us.\nOur vendors and licensees may be subject to various laws and government regulations, violation of which could subject these parties to sanctions which could lead to increased costs or the interruption of normal business operations that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur vendors and licensees may operate in a highly regulated environment in the US and international markets. Federal, state and local governmental entities and foreign governments may regulate aspects of their businesses, including the production or distribution of our content or products. These regulations may include accounting standards, taxation requirements (including changes in applicable income tax rates, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations), product safety and other safety standards, trade restrictions, regulations regarding financial matters, environmental regulations, advertising directed toward children, product content, and other administrative and regulatory restrictions. While we believe our vendors and licensees take all the steps necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that they are compliant or will be in compliance in the future. Failure to comply could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could increase our costs or decrease our revenue resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProtecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete in the animated content and entertainment industry depends, in part, upon successful protection of our proprietary and intellectual property. We protect our property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable companies in specific territories and media for limited durations. Despite these precautions, existing copyright and trademark laws afford only limited, or no, practical protection in some jurisdictions. It may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy and distribute our productions or portions of our productions. In addition, although we own most of the music and intellectual property included in our products, there are some titles which the music or other elements are in the public domain and for which it is difficult or even impossible to determine whether anyone has obtained ownership or royalty rights. It is an inherent risk in our industry that people may make such claims with respect to any title already included in our products, whether or not such claims can be substantiated. If litigation is necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the resulting diversion of resources could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nA substantial number of shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to the terms of the 2020 Convertible Notes, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe 2020 Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $1.375 per share, for an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares, or approximately 33.8% of our outstanding common stock as of March 29, 2020 (without taking into account the limitations on the conversion of the 2020 Convertible Notes as described elsewhere in this Report). If we obtain stockholder approval, the 2020 Convertible Notes will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.21 per share, for an aggregate of 65,476,190 shares, or approximately 221.2% of our outstanding common stock as of March 29, 2020 (without taking into account the limitations on the conversion of the 2020 Convertible Notes as described elsewhere in this Report). Furthermore, the number of shares of common stock to be issued may be substantially greater, if upon stockholder approval, the 2020 Convertible Notes are converted into shares of common stock in accordance with the installment conversion process, each as described elsewhere in this Report. In such case, the number of shares of common stock issued will be determined based on a discount to the then current market price. We cannot predict the market price of our common stock at any future date, and therefore, we are unable to accurately forecast or predict the total amount of shares that ultimately may be issued under the 2020 Convertible Notes. The number of shares of common stock to be issued also may be substantially greater if we voluntarily reduce the conversion price of the 2020 Convertible Notes as permitted under the 2020 Convertible Notes (if stockholder approval is obtained).\nThe 2020 Convertible Notes likely will be converted only at times when it is economically beneficially for the holder to do so, and we are entitled to make installment conversions only at a price per share that is at a discount to the then current market price. The issuance of these shares will dilute our other equity holders, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe requirement that we repay the 2020 Convertible Notes and interest thereon in cash under certain circumstances, and the restrictive covenants contained in the 2020 Convertible Notes, could adversely affect our business plan, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to repay the 2020 Convertible Notes and interest thereon in cash if we do not meet certain customary equity conditions (including minimum price and volume thresholds) or in certain other circumstances. For example, we will be required to repay the outstanding principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, along with a premium, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the 2020 Convertible Notes). In addition, the 2020 Convertible Notes contain restrictive covenants, including a cash burn covenant. These obligations and covenants could have important consequences on our business. In particular, they could:\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on the 2020 Convertible Notes;\n\u25cf limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds and otherwise raise additional capital, and our ability to conduct acquisitions, joint, ventures or similar arrangements, as a result of our obligations to make such payments and comply with the restrictive covenants in the 2020 Convertible Notes;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lower fixed costs.\nIn the event we are required to repay the 2020 Convertible Notes in cash, we may seek to refinance the remaining balance, by either refinancing with the holders of the 2020 Convertible Notes, by raising sufficient funds through a sale of equity or debt securities or by obtaining a credit facility. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in making the required payments under the 2020 Convertible Notes, or in refinancing our obligations on favorable terms, or at all. Should we determine to refinance, it could be dilutive to shareholders.\nIf we are unable to make the required cash payments, there could be a default under the 2020 Convertible Notes. In such event, or if a default otherwise occurs under the 2020 Convertible Notes, including as a result of our failure to comply with the financial or other covenants contained therein, the holders of the 2020 Convertible Note could require us to immediately repay the outstanding principal and interest on the 2020 Convertible Note in cash, plus a significant premium.\nOur stock price may be subject to substantial volatility, and stockholders may lose all or a substantial part of their investment.\nOur common stock currently trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market. There is limited public float, and trading volume historically has been low and sporadic. As a result, the market price for our common stock may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of our fair market value. The price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the number of shares available for sale in the market, quarterly variations in our operating results, actual or anticipated announcements of new releases by us or competitors, the gain or loss of significant customers, changes in the estimates of our operating performance, market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our Common Stock.\nOn September 4, 2019, we received a notification letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) informing us that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of the our Common Stock had closed below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum required closing bid price for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cRule\u201d).\nThis notice has no immediate effect on our Nasdaq listing or trading of its Common Stock. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had 180 calendar days, or until March 2, 2020, to regain compliance. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our Common Stock must have been at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If we did not regain compliance by March 2, 2020, we were potentially eligible for additional time to regain compliance or if we were otherwise not eligible, we were able to request a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (\u201cPanel\u201d).\nOn March 3, 2020, we received notification from Nasdaq that we were granted an additional 180-day compliance period, or until August 31, 2020, to regain compliance with the minimum $1.00 bid price per share requirement of the Rule. Nasdaq\u2019s determination to grant the additional 180-day compliance period was based on our meeting the continued listing requirement for the market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market with the exception of the bid price requirement, and our provision of written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, including effecting a reverse stock split if necessary.\nIf at any time before August 31, 2020, the bid price of our Common Stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we will regain compliance with the Rule, and the matter will be closed.\nIf we do not meet the minimum bid requirement during the additional 180-day grace period, Nasdaq will provide written notification to us that our Common Stock will be subject to delisting. At such time, we may appeal the delisting determination to a Panel. We would remain listed pending the Panel\u2019s decision. There can be no assurance that, if we do appeal a subsequent delisting determination by the Staff to the Panel, that such appeal would be successful.\nThis current notification from Nasdaq has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our Common Stock, which will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cGNUS\u201d\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Capital Market, such as minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our Common Stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our Common Stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our Common Stock, prevent our Common Stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements.\nIf our Common Stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell our Common Stock.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The OTC Bulletin Board does not meet such requirements and if the price of our Common Stock is less than $5.00 and our Common Stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange such as Nasdaq, our stock may be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, at least two business days prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver to the customer a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information and to obtain from the customer a signed and date acknowledgment of receipt of that document. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive: (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our Common Stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation, the disclosure of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require an annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, and for certain issuers an attestation of this assessment by the issuer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal controls over financial reporting as effective are evolving and complex, and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We expect to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is difficult for us to predict how long it will take or costly it will be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis. In addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. Any additional preferred stock that we issue in the future may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than our common stock. In addition, such preferred stock may contain provisions allowing those shares to be converted into shares of common stock, which could dilute the value of common stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price, if any, of our common stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of authorized preferred stock, there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. Our current intention is to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future to increasing our capital base and development and marketing efforts. There can be no assurance that we will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our common stock, and in any event, a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because the return on investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144, or shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d and, in anticipation of which, the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nIn general, under Rule 144, a non-affiliated person who has held restricted shares of our common stock for a period of six months may sell into the market all of their shares, subject to us being current in our periodic reports filed with the Commission.\nAs of March 29, 2020, approximately 29,592,229 shares of common stock of the 29,592,229 shares of common stock issued and outstanding are free trading. Additionally, as of March 29, 2019, there are 2,047,619 shares of common stock underlying the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that could be sold pursuant to Rule 144. As of the same date, there are 62,630,757 shares of common stock underlying outstanding warrants that could be sold pursuant to Rule 144 to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements as well as 928,263 shares of common stock underlying registered warrants. Lastly, as of March 29, 2019, there are 1,289,866 shares of common stock underlying outstanding options granted and 877,801 shares reserved for issuance under our Genius Brands International, Inc. Amended 2015 Incentive Plan, all of which are unregistered but will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Following the six month anniversary of the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 2020 Convertible Notes become eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and depress our stock price.\nBased on the number of shares outstanding as of March 29, 2020, our officers, directors and stockholders who hold at least 5% of our stock beneficially own a combined total of approximately 85.19% of our outstanding common stock, including shares of common stock subject to preferred shares, stock options, and warrants that are currently convertible or exercisable or will be convertible or exercisable within 60 days after March 29, 2020. If these officers, directors, and principal stockholders or a group of our principal stockholders act together, they will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of mergers, business combinations or other significant transactions. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. For instance, officers, directors, and principal stockholders, acting together, could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider. Similarly, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company otherwise favored by our other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 16463, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "GNUS"}
