In addition, certain statements in future filings by Park with the SEC, in press releases, and in oral and written statements made by or with the approval of Park which are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Examples of forward-looking statements include: (i) projections of income or expense, earnings per share, the payment or non-payment of dividends, capital structure and other financial items; (ii) statements of plans and objectives of Park or our management or Board of Directors, including those relating to products or services or to potential or pending acquisitions; (iii) statements of future economic performance; and (iv) statements of assumptions underlying such statements. Words such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201ctargeted\u201d and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Park desires to take advantage of the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those predicted by the forward-looking statements because of various factors and possible events, including those factors and events identified below. There is also the risk that Park\u2019s management or Park's Board of Directors incorrectly analyzes these risks and uncertainties or that the strategies Park develops to address such risks and uncertainties are unsuccessful. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except as may be required by law, Park undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Park or any person acting on Park\u2019s behalf are qualified in their entirety by the preceding cautionary statements.\nEconomic, Political and Market Risks\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 or any other pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has negatively impacted global, national and local economies, disrupted global and national supply chains, lowered equity market valuations, and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. In addition, the pandemic resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities and may result in the same or similar restrictions in the future. As a result, the demand for our products and services have been and may continue to be significantly impacted, which could adversely affect\nour revenue and results of operations. Furthermore, the pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, particularly if businesses remain required to operate at diminished capacities or are required to close again, the impact on the global, national and local economies worsens, or more customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses.\nThe effects of COVID-19 could be particularly pronounced with respect to certain of the higher risk portions of PNB's loan portfolio:\n\u2022Strip shopping centers, due to declining interest in such spaces by their users and declining interest in visiting shared spaces. As of December 31, 2021, excluding PPP loans, this portfolio was $265.5 million, or 3.9% of PNB's loan portfolio.\n\u2022Restaurants and food service, due to stay at home orders and requirements that restaurants provide carry-out only service. As of December 31, 2021, excluding PPP loans, this portfolio was $53.3 million, or 0.8% of PNB's loan portfolio.\n\u2022Hotel and accommodations, due to travel limitations implemented by governments and businesses as well as declining interest in travel, generally. As of December 31, 2021, excluding PPP loans, this portfolio was $220.1 million, or 3.2% of PNB's loan portfolio.\nAdditionally, there is risk in our non-bank consumer finance companies and indirect consumer (auto) lending, due to the impact of the disrupted global supply chains on the availability and price of automobiles--both new and used. As of December 31, 2021, excluding PPP loans, the portions of these portfolios dedicated to automobile-based loans aggregated to $1.8 billion, or 26.3% of PNB's loan portfolio.\nOur business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we hold and service PPP loans. These PPP loans are subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and to complex and evolving rules and guidance issued by the SBA and other government agencies. While a large number of our PPP borrowers have applied for and received full or partial forgiveness of their loan obligations, we still have credit risk on the remaining PPP loans in the event the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced such PPP loans, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive funding. We could face additional risks in our administrative capabilities to service our PPP loans and to properly determine loan forgiveness. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced the PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency.\nThe spread of COVID-19, including new variants thereof, has also caused us to modify our business practices, including associate travel, associate work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. Further, technology in associates\u2019 homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications and other tools available to such employees to be more limited or less reliable. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk from phishing, malware and other cybersecurity attacks, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\nCOVID-19, the rise of new strains thereof, or a new pandemic could subject us to any of the following risks, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u2022demand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u2022if the economy continues to be unable to fully re-open, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n\u2022collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022our allowance for credit losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u2022the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022a prolonged weakness in economic conditions resulting in a reduction of future projected earnings could result in our recording a valuation allowance against our current outstanding deferred tax assets;\n\u2022we rely on third-party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to COVID-19 could have an adverse effect on us; and\n\u2022continued adverse economic conditions could result in protracted volatility in the price of our Common Shares.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depend on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key associates due to COVID-19, including new variants thereof, or any similar pandemic could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy will likely require time to recover, the length of which is unknown and during which the United States may experience a recession or market correction. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by any such recession or market correction.\nWe continue to closely monitor COVID-19 and related risks as they evolve. To the extent the effects of COVID-19 adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Item.\nChanges in economic and political conditions could adversely affect our earnings and capital through declines in deposits, quality of investment securities, loan demand, our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans, and the value of the collateral securing our loans.\nOur success depends, to a certain extent, upon local and national economic and political conditions, as well as governmental fiscal and monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, fiscal and monetary policy, tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from or significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars, and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our deposit levels and composition, the quality of our assets including investment securities available for purchase and the demand for loans, which, in turn, may adversely affect our earnings and capital. Recent political developments have resulted in substantial changes in economic and political conditions for the United States and the remainder of the world. Disruptions in United States and global financial markets and changes in oil production in the Middle East affect the economy and stock prices in the United States, which can affect our earnings and our capital, as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans. Because we have a significant number of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Adverse changes in the economy, including those resulting from COVID-19, including new variants thereof, may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows.\nChanges in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur earnings and cash flows depend substantially on our interest rate spread, which is the difference between: (i) the rates we earn on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets; and (ii) the interest rates we pay on deposits and our borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy influence the origination of loans, the prepayment speed of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and rates of interest received and paid. If market interest rates rise, Park will have competitive pressure to increase the rates that Park pays on deposits, which could result in a decrease of Park's net interest income. If market rates decline, Park could experience fixed-rate loan prepayments and higher investment portfolio cash flows, resulting in a lower yield on earning assets. Park's earnings can also be impacted by the spread between short-term and long-term market interest rates.\nWhile we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk, especially in light of the continued economic effects of COVID-19. Information pertaining to the impact changes in interest rates could have on our net income is included in \"Table 38 - Interest Rate Sensitivity\" in \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in the general economic conditions and real estate valuations in our primary market areas could adversely impact results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur lending and deposit gathering activities are concentrated primarily in Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina and South Carolina. Our success depends on the general economic conditions of our primary market areas, particularly given that a significant portion of our lending relates to real estate located in these regions. Adverse changes in the regional and general economic conditions could reduce our growth rate, impair our ability to collect payments on loans, increase loan delinquencies, increase problem assets and foreclosures, increase claims and lawsuits, increase devaluations recognized within our OREO portfolio, decrease the demand for our products and services and decrease the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate values, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a reference rate for financial instruments could negatively affect our income and expenses and the value of various financial instruments.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the United States and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, to facilitate an orderly LIBOR transition, the OCC, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Board jointly announced that entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create a safety and soundness risk. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of one-week and two-month LIBOR, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining LIBOR settings. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\"ARRC\") has recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate.\nThese differences could lead to a greater disconnect between our costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. For cash products and loans, ARRC has also recommended Term SOFR, which is a forward-looking SOFR based on SOFR futures and may in part reduce differences between SOFR and LIBOR. There are operational issues which may create a delay in the transition to SOFR or other substitute indices, leading to uncertainty across the industry. These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit.\nPark has limited exposure to LIBOR, with total exposure as of December 31, 2021 of approximately $686.4 million. We do not believe the change to a benchmark like SOFR will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nBusiness Operations Risks\nWe are exposed to operational risk.\nSimilar to any large organization, we are exposed to many types of operational risk, including those discussed in more detail elsewhere in this Item, such as reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. These risks are heightened in light of COVID-19.\nWe may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, spikes in transaction volume and/or customer activity, electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters. We could be adversely affected by operating systems disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into existing operating systems. Although we have programs in place related to business continuity, disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our operating systems, business applications and customer information, such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers, loss of data privacy, and loss or liability to us.\nAny failure or interruption in our operating or information systems, or any security or data breach, could cause reputational damage, jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to\nregulatory intervention or expose us to civil litigation and financial loss or liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nNegative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, social media and other marketing activities, the implementation of environmental, social, and governance practices, and from actions taken by governmental regulators and community organizations in response to any of the foregoing. Negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers, could expose us to potential litigation or regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Common Shares or result in heightened volatility.\nGiven the volume of transactions we process, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process our transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect, which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) or that our (or our vendors\u2019) consumer compliance, business continuity, and data security systems will prove to be inadequate.\nOur business could be adversely affected by third-party service providers, data breaches and cyber-attacks.\nWe face the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to our dependency on third-party vendors for components of our business infrastructure. While we have selected these third-party vendors through our vendor management process, we do not control their operations. Further, the operations of our third-party vendors could fail or otherwise become delayed as a result of COVID-19 and any new variants thereof. As such, our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event these vendors are unable to perform their various responsibilities and we are unable to timely and cost-effectively identify acceptable substitute providers.\nRegulatory guidance adopted by federal bank regulatory agencies addressing how banks select, engage and manage their third-party relationships could affect the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third-party service providers and the costs of managing such relationships.\nOur assets at risk for cyber-attacks include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. We use several third-party vendors who have access to our assets via electronic media. Certain cybersecurity risks arise due to this access, including cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, malware, and theft. We employ many preventive and detective controls to protect our assets, and we provide mandatory recurring information security training to all employees. To date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks or attempted breaches, or incur resulting losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened due to, among other factors, the evolving nature of these threats, our plans to continue to implement or expand Internet and mobile banking to meet customer demand, the continuing impact of COVID-19 and the governmental and other responses thereto and the current economic and political environment. As cybersecurity and other data security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nFailures or material breaches in security of our systems, or those of third-party service providers, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and the price of our Common Shares.\nWe collect, process and store sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both us and third-party service providers. Our dependence upon automated systems to record and process our transactions poses the risk that technical system flaws, employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems, or attacks by third parties will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. We have security and backup and recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan, to ensure the computer systems will not become inoperable, to the extent possible. We also routinely review documentation of such controls and backups related to third-party service providers. Our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations. In recent years, several banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank's website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. Other businesses have been victims of ransomware attacks in which the business becomes unable to access its own information and is presented with a demand to pay a ransom in order to once again have access to its information. We could be adversely affected if one of our employees or a third-party service provider causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where the individual purposefully sabotages or\nfraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. We may not be able to prevent employee or third-party errors or misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect this type of activity might prove ineffective. We are further exposed to the risk that the third-party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risks that we are). These disruptions may interfere with service to our customers, cause additional regulatory scrutiny and result in a financial loss or liability. We are also at risk of the impact of natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities on our systems or for the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others.\nIn addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. Although we have policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of our customers, we cannot assure that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers.\nWe have implemented security controls to prevent unauthorized access to our computer systems, and we require that our third-party service providers maintain similar controls. However, Park's management cannot be certain that these measures will be successful. A security breach of the computer systems and loss of confidential information, such as customer account numbers and related information, could result in a loss of customers\u2019 confidence and, thus, loss of business. We could also lose revenue if competitors gain access to confidential information about our business operations and use it to compete with us. While we maintain specific \"cyber\" insurance coverage, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. Furthermore, because cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some breaches may not be covered under our cyber insurance coverage.\nFurther, we may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with us and our customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of our debit card PIN numbers and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in us incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAll of the types of cyber incidents discussed above could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customer business, increased costs of incentives to customers or business partners in order to maintain their relationships, litigation, increased regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions, repairs of system damage, increased investments in cybersecurity (such as obtaining additional technology, making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel, training personnel and engaging consultants), increased insurance premiums, and loss of investor confidence and a reduction in the price of our Common Shares, all of which could result in financial loss and material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe extend credit to a variety of customers based on certain internal standards and the judgment of our loan officers. Our credit standards and on-going process of credit assessment might not protect us from significant credit losses.\nWe take credit risk by virtue of making loans and leases, extending loan commitments and letters of credit and, to a lesser degree, purchasing municipal bonds and purchasing collateralized loan obligations. Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize \u201cin-market\u201d lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. Our loans to non-bank consumer finance companies are made nationally and present different risks than our \"in-market\" lending due to the variability of cash flows that support the asset-based loans. Our credit administration function employs risk management techniques to ensure that loans and leases adhere to corporate policy and problem loans and leases are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide us with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary, and to take proactive corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk.\nOur business and financial results are subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties.\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from, among other factors, extending credit to customers, purchasing non-governmental securities, and entering into certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of the most significant risks to our business, particularly given the high percentage of our assets represented directly and indirectly by loans and the importance of lending to our overall business. As discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, many factors\nimpact credit risk, and we manage this by periodically assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers and by diversifying our loan portfolio.\nA borrower's ability to repay a loan can be adversely affected by individual factors, such as business performance, job losses or health issues. A weak or deteriorating economy and changes in the United States or global markets and changes in interest rates also could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans. Any decrease in our borrowers' ability to repay loans would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and provision for credit losses.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.\nDespite maintaining a diversified portfolio, our operations may result in concentrated credit exposure to a particular person, entity, industry or counterparty. Events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets, a decrease in the credit quality of a customer base, or an adverse change in the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral held by us to secure obligations to us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan.\nUp until 2020, Park's provision for credit losses had declined since the end of the most recent recession, which ended in June 2009, primarily due to improvement in general economic conditions, as well as actions taken by us to better manage our loan portfolio. During 2020, Park experienced elevated provision for credit losses primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. If we were to experience higher levels of provision for credit losses, it could result in lower levels of net income.\nOur expansion into Kentucky, South Carolina and North Carolina may also exposes Park to additional geographic risk.\nOur allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb the expected, lifetime losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses that we believe is a reasonable estimate of the expected losses within the CECL model, based on management\u2019s quarterly analysis of our loan portfolio. The determination of the allowance for credit losses requires management to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Additional information regarding our allowance for credit losses methodology and the sensitivity of the estimates can be found in the discussion of \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d included in \u201cITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur estimation of future credit losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in regulations and interest rates, which may be beyond our control, and the losses may exceed current estimates. We cannot be assured of the amount of timing of losses, nor whether the allowance for credit losses will be adequate in the future.\nIf our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover the expected losses from our loan portfolio, resulting in the need for additions to the allowance for credit losses which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses as part of their examination process and may require management to increase the allowance or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\u201d which replaced the incurred loss model with the CECL model, an expected loss model. The new accounting guidance was to have been adopted by Park as of January 1, 2020. However, Section 4014 of the CARES Act provided financial institutions with optional temporary relief from having to comply with the CECL methodology which would have expired on December 31, 2020, and Section 540 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, further extended the relief period to the earlier of the first day of the fiscal year that begins after the date on which the national emergency concerning COVID-19 terminates or January 1, 2022. Park elected to delay the implementation of CECL following the approval of the CARES Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and adopted CECL as of January 1, 2021.\nThe accounting guidance under the CECL model requires banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables, HTM debt securities and reinsurance receivables, and off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. Under the CECL model, we are required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate the expected credit losses. If the methodologies and assumptions we use in the CECL model prove to be incorrect, or inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient, resulting in the need for additional provisions for credit losses to be recorded, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of the CECL model by Park resulted in a net decrease to retained earnings of $8.0 million as of January 1, 2021 for the cumulative effect of adopting ASC 326 and a net recovery of credit losses of $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result of the implementation of the CECL model, the time horizon over which we are required to estimate future credit losses expanded, which could result in increased volatility in future provisions for credit losses. We may also experience a higher or more volatile provision for credit losses due to higher levels of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs if commercial and consumer customers are unable to make scheduled loan payments.\nWe depend upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information provided to us by customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to a business, we may assume that the customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform with U.S. GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We may also rely on the audit report covering those financial statements. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that we rely on financial statements that do not comply with U.S. GAAP or on financial statements and other financial information that are materially misleading.\nWe may be required to repurchase loans we have sold or to indemnify loan purchasers under the terms of the sale agreements, which could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen we sell a mortgage loan, we may agree to repurchase or substitute a mortgage loan if we are later found to have breached any representation or warranty we made about the loan or if the borrower is later found to have committed fraud in connection with the origination of the loan. While we have underwriting policies and procedures designed to avoid breaches of representations and warranties we have made and borrower fraud, there can be no assurance that no breach or fraud will ever occur. Required repurchases, substitutions or indemnifications could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws and evolving regulation may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws or regulations may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNoncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us to experience a material financial loss.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the \u201cBSA\u201d) and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The BSA, as amended by the Patriot Act and the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (the \u201cAMLA\u201d), requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash\ntransactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (also known as FinCEN), a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the BSA, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. The AMLA is intended to be a comprehensive reform and modernization to U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, it codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the development of standards for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; and expands enforcement-related and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations and instituting BSA whistleblower incentives and protections.\nThere is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, or if the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we may be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, in terms of the products and services we offer and the geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as in our labor markets where we compete for talented employees. Competition could adversely impact our customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product pricing, causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues.\nWe are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions as well as from non-bank entities that engage in many similar activities without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions. This competition is described in \"ITEM 1. BUSINESS\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"Competition.\" Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies, in connection with current market conditions, or otherwise. Consumers may also move money out of bank deposits in favor of other investments, including digital or cryptocurrency. Customers have increasingly used bill payment services that do not utilize banks, and these trends may result in losses of deposits and fee income.\nThe principal bases for competition are pricing (including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on interest bearing deposits), product structure, the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer needs and concerns). Digital or cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and other \u201cfintech\u201d technologies are designed to enhance transactional security and have the potential to disrupt the financial industry, change the way banks do business, and reduce the need for banks as financial deposit-keepers and intermediaries. The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry, and it is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as it affects our ability to deliver the right products and services.\nAnother increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry is the competition to attract and retain talented associates across many of our business and support areas. This competition leads to increased expenses in many business areas and can also cause us to not pursue certain business opportunities.\nA failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. On the other hand, meeting these competitive pressures could require us to incur significant additional expense, to reevaluate the number of branches through which we serve our customers, or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, in our interest rate sensitive businesses, pressures to increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin with a resulting negative impact on our net interest income.\nWe may not be able to adapt to technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers while reducing costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. This could include the development, implementation, and adaptation of digital or cryptocurrency, blockchain, and other \u201cfintech\u201d technology. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully\nkeep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect our growth, revenue and net income.\nWe may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted extensive changes to their capital requirements, including raising required amounts and eliminating the inclusion of certain instruments from the calculation of capital. If we experience significant loan losses, additional capital may need to be infused. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance, conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or that the terms of available capital will be acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, prior debt offerings could potentially have important consequences to us and our debt and equity investors, including:\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments;\n\u2022making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\n\u2022increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase securities.\nWe continue to evaluate these risks on an ongoing basis.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our Common Shares is limited.\nAlthough we have paid a dividend on our Common Shares every quarter since becoming a public company, our Board of Directors reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis and establishes the dividend rate based on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and other regulatory requirements, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. As a financial holding company, we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries and affiliates. Our principal source of funds to pay dividends on our Common Shares and service our debt is dividends from our subsidiaries. In the event our subsidiaries become unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our other obligations or pay dividends on our Common Shares. Accordingly, our inability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Park National Bank and our other subsidiaries may pay to us without regulatory approval. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks as well as financial holding companies and other bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Thus, the ability of Park National Bank to pay dividends in the future is currently influenced, and could be further influenced, by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines and may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders.\nPayment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if Park National Bank were to become \u201cundercapitalized\u201d for purposes of the applicable \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regulations. Throughout 2021 and 2022 to date, Park National Bank has been in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and had sufficient capital under the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regulations to be deemed \u201cwell-capitalized.\u201d There are also restrictions on the ability of Park National Bank to pay dividends if it does not hold the applicable capital conservation buffer.\nIf any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that subsidiary\u2019s assets. Our rights and the rights of our creditors will be subject to that prior claim, unless we are also a direct creditor of that subsidiary.\nDerivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses.\nWe are party to a number of derivative transactions. Many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring or settling the position difficult. We carry borrowings which contain embedded derivatives. These borrowing arrangements require that we deliver underlying securities to the counterparty as collateral. We are dependent on the creditworthiness of the counterparties and are therefore susceptible to credit and operational risk in these situations.\nDerivative instruments and other transactions entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties on a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and, in the event of a default, we may find it more difficult to enforce the underlying derivative instrument. In addition, as new and more complex derivative products are created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying derivative instruments could arise, which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs. Any regulatory effort to create an exchange or trading platform for credit derivatives and other over-the-counter derivative instruments, or a market shift toward standardized derivative instruments, could reduce the risk associated with such transactions, but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivative instruments that best suit our needs and those of our clients and adversely affect our profitability.\nLegislative, Regulatory and Accounting Change Risks\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions could adversely impact us or the businesses in which we are engaged.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, borrowers, the DIF and the banking system as a whole, and not to benefit our shareholders. Regulations affecting banks and financial services businesses are undergoing continuous change, especially in light of COVID-19 and the stimulus programs implemented in connection therewith, and management cannot predict the effect of these changes. While such changes are generally intended to lessen the regulatory burden on financial institutions, the impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us or our ability to increase the value of our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a financial institution, the classification of assets held by a financial institution, the adequacy of a financial institution\u2019s allowance for credit losses and the ability to complete acquisitions. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies against us could cause us to devote significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties that materially affect us and our shareholders. Even the reduction of regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on us and our shareholders if such lessening of restrictions increases competition within our industry or our market area.\nIn light of conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy that occurred in the last decade, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Most recently, the U.S. Congress and the federal agencies regulating the financial services industry have acted on an unprecedented scale in responding to the stresses experienced in the global financial markets. Some of the laws enacted by the U.S. Congress and regulations promulgated by federal bank regulatory agencies subject us, and other financial institutions to which such laws and regulations apply, to additional restrictions, oversight and costs that may have an impact on our business, results of operations or the trading price of our Common Shares. In addition to laws, regulations and supervisory and enforcement actions directed at the operations of financial institutions, proposals to reform the housing finance market consider significant changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could negatively affect our sales of loans.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG-related compliance costs for us as well as among our third-party suppliers, vendors and various other parties within our supply chain could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could\nnegatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, access to capital, and the price of our Common Shares.\nDeposit insurance premiums assessed on Park National Bank may increase and have a negative effect on Park\u2019s results of operations.\nWe have limited ability to control the amount of premiums we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. The DIF is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions. If the costs of future bank failures increase, deposit insurance premiums may also increase. The FDIC has adopted rules revising its assessments in a manner benefiting banks with assets totaling less than $10 billion. There can be no assurance, however, that assessments will not be changed in the future. Federal deposit insurance is described in more detail in the section captioned \"Supervision and Regulation of Park and its Subsidiaries - Federal Deposit Insurance\" in \"ITEM 1. BUSINESS\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, estimates or procedures could impact our reported financial condition or results of operations.\nThe entities responsible for setting accounting standards, including the FASB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The pace of change continues to accelerate and changes in accounting standards can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, actual results may vary materially from management\u2019s estimates.\nAdditional information regarding Park\u2019s critical accounting policies and the sensitivity of estimates can be found in our discussion of \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d in \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes we use to estimate our credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and, in some cases, forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the model we use for determining our expected credit losses is inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support charge-offs. If the models we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\nFuture expansion may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as dilute the interests of our shareholders and negatively affect the price of our Common Shares.\nWe may acquire other financial institutions, or branches or assets of other financial institutions, in the future. We may also open new branches and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services. Any such expansion of our business will involve a number of expenses and risks, which may include:\n\u2022the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential expansions;\n\u2022the potential inaccuracy of estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risk with respect to target financial institutions;\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target financial institution;\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target financial institution;\n\u2022the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring local management and opening new offices, and the delay between commencing these activities and the generation of profits from the expansion;\n\u2022our financing of the expansion;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n\u2022risks associated with entry into unfamiliar markets;\n\u2022the introduction of new products and services into our existing business;\n\u2022the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022the risk of loss of key employees and customers;\n\u2022the risk associated with differing company cultures; and\n\u2022difficulty in receiving appropriate regulatory approval for any proposed transaction.\nWe may incur substantial costs to expand, and such expansion may not result in the levels of profits we expect. Integration efforts for any future acquisitions may not be successful. We may issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions, which could dilute the economic and voting interests of our existing shareholders.\nAny merger or acquisition opportunity that we decide to pursue will ultimately be subject to regulatory approval or other closing conditions. We may expend substantial time and resources pursing potential acquisitions which may not be consummated because regulatory approval or other closing conditions are not satisfied.\nChanges in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact our investments in our financial service office premises and equipment and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change our retail distribution channel.\nWe have significant investments in financial service office premises and equipment for our financial service office network, including 96 financial service offices as well as our retail work force and other financial service office banking assets. Advances in technology such as e-commerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences for these other methods of accessing our products and services, could affect the value of our financial service office network or other retail distribution assets and may cause us to change our retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain financial service offices and restructure or reduce our remaining financial service offices and work force. Further advances in technology and/or changes in customer preferences including those related to social media, digital or cryptocurrency, blockchain, and other \u201cfintech\u201d technologies could result in additional changes in our retail distribution strategy and/or financial service office network. These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining financial service offices or to otherwise reform our retail distribution channel.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may be a defendant from time to time in a variety of litigation and other actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation arising out of our business. The risk of litigation increases in times of increased troubled loan collection activity. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future or obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms.\nA default by another larger financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally.\nMany financial institutions and their related operations are closely intertwined, and the soundness of such financial institutions may, to some degree, be interdependent. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one financial institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems and/or losses or defaults by other financial institutions. This \u201csystemic risk\u201d may adversely affect our business.\nWe are at risk of increased losses from fraud.\nCriminals are committing fraud at an increasing rate and are using more sophisticated techniques. In some cases, these individuals are part of larger criminal rings, which allow them to be more effective. Such fraudulent activity has taken many\nforms, ranging from wire fraud, debit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices attached to ATM machines, social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information, or impersonation of clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials. Additionally, an individual or business entity may properly identify itself, yet seek to establish a business relationship for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. An emerging type of fraud even involves the creation of synthetic identification in which fraudsters \"create\" individuals for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. In addition to fraud committed directly against us, we may suffer losses as a result of fraudulent activity committed against third parties. Increased deployment of technologies, such as chip card technology, defray and reduce certain aspects of fraud; however, criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information, such as unaffiliated healthcare providers and government entities, in order to impersonate consumers and thereby commit fraud.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to our taxes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, fair values of net deferred tax assets and obligations of states and political subdivisions held in our investment securities portfolio. In addition, our customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by our customers may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for our loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on our customers could result in defaults on the loans we have made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which we have invested.\nAdverse changes in the financial markets may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWhile we generally invest in securities issued by U.S. government agencies and sponsored entities and domestic state and local governments with limited credit risk, certain investment securities we hold possess higher credit risk since they represent beneficial interests in structured investments collateralized by residential mortgages, debt obligations and other similar asset-backed assets. Even securities issued by U.S. governmental agencies and sponsored entities may entail risk depending on political and economic changes. Regardless of the level of credit risk, all investment securities are subject to changes in market value due to changing interest rates, implied credit spreads and credit ratings.", "PERMNO": 76266, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PRK"}
