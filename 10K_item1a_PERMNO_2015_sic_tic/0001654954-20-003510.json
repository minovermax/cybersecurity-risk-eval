{"cik": "1086745", "company": "DropCar, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in our most recent annual and quarterly filings with the SEC before purchasing our securities. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. The occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment in the offered securities.\nRisks Related to the AYRO Merger\nThere is no assurance when or if the AYRO Merger will be completed. Any delay in completing the AYRO Merger may substantially reduce the intended benefits that we and AYRO expect to obtain from the AYRO Merger.\nCompletion of the AYRO Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, as set forth in the AYRO Merger Agreement, including the approval by our stockholders, approval by Nasdaq of our application for initial listing of our common stock in connection with the AYRO Merger, and other customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that we and AYRO will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond our control will be satisfied or waived. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the AYRO Merger may not occur or will be delayed, and we and AYRO each may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the AYRO Merger. In addition, if the AYRO Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we or AYRO may be required to pay a termination fee of $1,000,000. Moreover, we and AYRO have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the AYRO Merger, such as legal and accounting fees, some of which must be paid even if the AYRO Merger is not completed.\nIn addition, if the AYRO Merger Agreement is terminated and our or AYRO\u2019s board of directors determines to seek another business combination, we may not be able to find a third party willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided by us and AYRO in the AYRO Merger. In such circumstances, DropCar\u2019s board of directors ( the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d) may elect to, among other things, divest all or a portion of our business, or take the steps necessary to liquidate all of our business and assets, and in either such case, the consideration that we receive may be less attractive than the consideration we receive pursuant to the AYRO Merger Agreement.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock to AYRO stockholders in the AYRO Merger will substantially dilute the voting power of our current stockholders. Having a minority share position may reduce the influence that current stockholders have on our management.\nPursuant to the terms of the AYRO Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the AYRO Merger, we will issue approximately 41,927,211 pre-reverse stock split shares of our common stock to AYRO equity holders as merger consideration, including shares to be issued in respect of the sale by AYRO prior to the AYRO Merger of shares of AYRO common stock (or common stock equivalents) representing an aggregate of 16.55% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company after giving effect to the AYRO Merger and warrants to purchase an equivalent number of shares of AYRO common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 million (the \u201cAYRO Private Placement\u201d) shares and upon conversion of the bridge loans immediately prior to the closing of the AYRO Merger. As a result, assuming the conversion of all shares of our preferred stock into common stock and the exercise of the pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,750,000 shares of AYRO common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per whole share (the \u201cPre-funded Warrants\u201d), upon completion of the AYRO Merger, our current stockholders will hold 9,902,276 pre-reverse stock split shares, or approximately 18.0% of the issued and outstanding equity; former AYRO stockholders will own 43,458,376 pre-reverse stock split shares, or approximately 79.0% of the issued and outstanding equity in our common stock, in each case, excluding certain warrants, options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d); and the financial advisor to us and AYRO will own approximately 1,650,329 pre-reverse stock split shares, or approximately 3% of our outstanding equity. Accordingly, the issuance of the shares of our common stock to AYRO equity holders in the AYRO Merger will significantly reduce the ownership stake and relative voting power of each share of our common stock held by our current stockholders. Consequently, following the AYRO Merger, the ability of our current stockholders to influence the management of the company will be substantially reduced.\nBecause the lack of a public market for AYRO common stock makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the AYRO Merger, AYRO stockholders may receive consideration in the AYRO Merger that is greater than or less than the fair market value of AYRO common stock.\nThe outstanding capital stock of AYRO is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of AYRO shares. Since the percentage of our common stock to be issued to AYRO equity holders was determined based on negotiations between us and AYRO, it is possible that the value of our common stock to be issued in connection with the AYRO Merger will be greater than the fair market value of AYRO shares. Alternatively, it is possible that the value of the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the AYRO Merger will be less than the fair market value of AYRO shares.\nOur directors and officers and AYRO\u2019s directors and officers may have interests in the AYRO Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders and AYRO stockholders generally that may influence them to support or approve the AYRO Merger.\nOur officers and directors and AYRO\u2019s officers and directors may have interests in the AYRO Merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of our stockholders and AYRO stockholders generally. Effective upon the closing of the AYRO Merger, Mr. Keller and Mr. Smith will be employed by the combined company and receive compensation and other consideration. Three of our current directors, which shall include Joshua Silverman and two other current directors, and all of the current directors of AYRO will be appointed as directors of the combined company after the completion of the AYRO Merger and will receive cash and equity compensation in consideration for such service. All of AYRO\u2019s executive officers are expected to continue to serve as our executive officers after the completion of the AYRO Merger. Each outstanding stock option to acquire shares of AYRO common stock held by executive officers and directors of AYRO will be converted into an option to acquire shares of our common stock. In addition, our directors and executive officers and AYRO\u2019s directors and executive officers also have certain rights to indemnification or to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance that will survive the completion of the AYRO Merger. These interests may have influenced our directors and executive officers and AYRO\u2019s directors and executive officers to support or recommend the proposals presented to our stockholders and AYRO stockholders.\nThe announcement and pendency of the AYRO Merger could have an adverse effect on our or AYRO\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the AYRO Merger could disrupt our and/or AYRO\u2019s businesses in the following ways, among others:\n\u25cf\nour or AYRO\u2019s current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future roles within the combined company, and this uncertainty might adversely affect our or AYRO\u2019s ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe attention of our or AYRO\u2019s management may be directed towards the completion of the AYRO Merger and other transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from our or AYRO\u2019s day-to-day business operations, as applicable, and matters related to the AYRO Merger may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to us or AYRO, as applicable;\n\u25cf\ncustomers, prospective customers, suppliers, collaborators and other third parties with business relationships with us or AYRO may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or AYRO as a result of the AYRO Merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or AYRO; and\n\u25cf\nthe market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the AYRO Merger will be completed.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses of, or harm the financial condition, results of operations or business prospects of, the company or AYRO.\nDuring the pendency of the AYRO Merger, the company or AYRO may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party and will be subject to contractual limitations on certain actions because of restrictions in the AYRO Merger Agreement.\nCovenants in the AYRO Merger Agreement impede our or AYRO\u2019s ability to make acquisitions or complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the AYRO Merger, other than the sale of substantially all of our assets pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the AYRO Private Placement and the issuance of the Pre-funded Warrants to be issued in a nominal stock subscription (the \u201cNominal Stock Subscription\u201d). As a result, if the AYRO Merger is not completed, we and AYRO may be at a disadvantage to our competitors, respectively. In addition, while the AYRO Merger Agreement is in effect and subject to limited exceptions, both us and AYRO are prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or taking actions designed to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that could lead to the entering into certain extraordinary transactions with any third party, such as a sale of assets, an acquisition, a tender offer, a merger or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business. These restrictions may prevent us and AYRO from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or other capital structure alternatives and making other changes to our business or executing certain of our business strategies prior to the completion of the AYRO Merger, which could be favorable to our stockholders or AYRO stockholders.\nCertain provisions of the AYRO Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting competing proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the AYRO Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the AYRO Merger Agreement prohibit each of us and AYRO from soliciting competing proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances if our Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with our independent financial advisor, if any, and outside counsel, that an unsolicited competing proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a superior competing proposal and that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of our Board of Directors. In addition, if we or AYRO terminate the AYRO Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, in our case, terminating because of a decision of our Board of Directors to recommend a superior competing proposal, we or AYRO would be required to pay a termination fee of $1,000,000. This termination fee may discourage third parties from submitting competing proposals to us or our stockholders and may cause our Board of Directors to be less inclined to recommend a competing proposal.\nThe rights of AYRO stockholders who become our stockholders in the AYRO Merger and our stockholders following the AYRO Merger will be governed by an amended and restated charter and amended and restated bylaws.\nUpon consummation of the AYRO Merger, outstanding shares of AYRO common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of our common stock. AYRO stockholders who receive shares of our common stock in the AYRO Merger will become our stockholders. As a result, AYRO stockholders who become our stockholders will be governed by our organizational documents and bylaws, rather than being governed by AYRO\u2019s organizational documents and bylaws. Pursuant to the AYRO Merger Agreement, our charter will be amended and restated, subject to our stockholders\u2019 approval, and our bylaws will be amended and restated, immediately prior to the effective time of the AYRO Merger.\nThe Exchange Ratio is not adjustable based on the market price of our common stock, so the merger consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser value than at the time the AYRO Merger Agreement was signed.\nIf the AYRO Merger is completed, holders of outstanding shares of AYRO common stock and preferred stock will be entitled to receive 1.1893 shares of our common stock per share of AYRO common stock they hold or into which their shares of preferred stock convert (the \u201cExchange Ratio\u201d). The AYRO Merger Agreement has set the Exchange Ratio formula for the AYRO common stock, and the Exchange Ratio is only adjustable upward or downward to reflect our and AYRO\u2019s equity capitalization as of immediately prior to the effective time of the AYRO Merger. Any changes in the market price of common stock before the completion of the AYRO Merger will not affect the number of shares AYRO securityholders will be entitled to receive pursuant to the AYRO Merger Agreement. Therefore, if before the completion of the AYRO Merger, the market price of our common stock declines from the market price on the date of the AYRO Merger Agreement, then AYRO securityholders could receive merger consideration with substantially lower value. Similarly, if before the completion of the AYRO Merger, the market price of our common stock increases from the market price on the date of the AYRO Merger Agreement, then AYRO securityholders could receive merger consideration with substantially more value for their shares of AYRO capital stock than had been negotiated for in the establishment of the Exchange Ratio.\nIf the AYRO Merger does not qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or is otherwise taxable to U.S. AYRO equity holders, then such holders may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, the AYRO Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. If the Internal Revenue Services (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or a court determines that the AYRO Merger should not be treated as a reorganization, a holder of AYRO common stock and warrants would recognize taxable gain or loss upon the exchange of AYRO common stock and conversion of warrants for our common stock and warrants pursuant to the AYRO Merger Agreement.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial expenses related to the AYRO Merger.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the AYRO Merger, as well as operating as a public company. We will incur significant fees and expenses relating to legal, accounting, financial advisory and other transaction fees and costs associated with the AYRO Merger. Actual transaction costs may substantially exceed estimates and may have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to complete the AYRO Merger could negatively affect the value of our common stock and the future business and financial results of both us and AYRO.\nIf the AYRO Merger is not completed, our ongoing businesses and AYRO\u2019s ongoing business, as the case may be, could be adversely affected and we and AYRO will be subject to a variety of risks associated with the failure to complete the AYRO Merger, including without limitation the following:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic opportunities while working to implement the AYRO Merger;\n\u25cf\nreputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the AYRO Merger; and\n\u25cf\nhaving to pay certain costs relating to the AYRO Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing fees.\nIf the AYRO Merger is not completed, these risks could materially affect the market price of our common stock and the business and financial results of both us and AYRO.\nThe AYRO Merger is expected to result in a limitation on the combined company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforward.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, use of our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) will be limited if we experience a cumulative change in ownership of greater than 50% in a moving three-year period. We will experience an ownership change as a result of the AYRO Merger and therefore our ability to utilize our NOLs and certain credit carryforwards remaining at the effective time of the AYRO Merger will be limited. The limitation will be determined by the fair market value of our common stock outstanding prior to the ownership change, multiplied by the applicable federal rate. It is expected that the AYRO Merger will impose a limitation on our NOLs. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause U.S. federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs.\nThe opinion received by our Board of Directors from Gemini has not been, and is not expected to be, updated to reflect changes in circumstances that may have occurred since the date of the opinion.\nAt a meeting held on December 18, 2019, our financial advisor, Gemini, rendered its opinion as to the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view to the company as of the date of such opinion, and such opinion was one of many factors considered by our Board of Directors in approving the AYRO Merger. The opinion does not speak as of the time the AYRO Merger will be completed or any date other than the date of such opinion. Subsequent changes in the operation and prospects of the company or AYRO, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of the company or AYRO, may significantly alter the value of the company or AYRO or the prices of the shares of our common stock by the time the AYRO Merger is to be completed. The opinion does not address the fairness of the merger consideration from our financial point of view at the time the AYRO Merger is to be completed, or as of any other date other than the date of such opinion, and the AYRO Merger Agreement does not require that the opinion be updated, revised or reaffirmed prior to the closing of the AYRO Merger to reflect any changes in circumstances between the date of the signing of the AYRO Merger Agreement and the completion of the AYRO Merger as a condition to closing the AYRO Merger.\nThe AYRO Merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the AYRO Merger, industry-wide changes or other causes.\nIn general, the company or AYRO can refuse to complete the AYRO Merger if there is a material adverse change (as defined in the AYRO Merger Agreement) affecting the other party between December 19, 2019, the date of the AYRO Merger Agreement, and the closing of the AYRO Merger. However, some types of changes do not permit either us or AYRO to refuse to complete the AYRO Merger, even if such changes would materially and adversely affect us or AYRO, as the case may be:\n\u25cf\nchanges in general economic, business, financial or market conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanges or events affecting the industries or industry sectors in which we or AYRO operate generally;\n\u25cf\nchanges in generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws, rules, regulations, decrees, rulings, ordinances, codes or requirements issued, enacted, adopted or otherwise put into effect by or under the authority of any governmental body;\n\u25cf\nchanges caused by the announcement or pendency of the AYRO Merger;\n\u25cf\nchanges caused by any action taken by either us or AYRO with the prior written consent of the other party;\n\u25cf\nchanges caused by any decision, action, or inaction by governmental or regulatory bodies, with respect to any of our products or AYRO\u2019s products;\n\u25cf\nchanges caused by any act of war, terrorism, national or international calamity or any other similar event;\n\u25cf\nwith respect to us, a decline in our stock price; or\n\u25cf\nwith respect to us, a change in the listing status of our common stock on Nasdaq.\nIf adverse changes occur but we and AYRO must still complete the AYRO Merger, the market price of our common stock may suffer.\nWe and AYRO may become involved in securities litigation or stockholder derivative litigation in connection with the AYRO Merger, and this could divert the attention of our management and AYRO\u2019s management and harm the combined company\u2019s business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all related costs and damages.\nSecurities litigation or stockholder derivative litigation frequently follows the announcement of certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a business division or announcement of a business combination transaction. We and AYRO may become involved in this type of litigation in connection with the AYRO Merger, and the combined company may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation is often expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, the AYRO business and the combined company.\nRisks Related to the Asset Sale Transaction\nWhile the Asset Sale Transaction is pending, it creates unknown impacts on our future which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile the Asset Sale Transaction is pending, it creates unknown impacts on our future. Therefore, our current or potential business partners may decide to delay, defer or cancel entering into new business arrangements with us pending consummation of the Asset Sale Transaction. The occurrence of these events individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to consummate the Asset Sale Transaction may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Asset Sale Transaction is subject to various closing conditions including, among others: (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote on the approval of the asset sale proposal and (ii) the consummation of a change in control transaction of our company, which will occur as a result of the AYRO Merger. We cannot control these conditions and cannot assure you that they will be satisfied. If the Asset Sale Transaction is not consummated, we may be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to consummate the AYRO Merger, the closing of which is conditioned upon the consummation of the Asset Sale Transaction;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to identify an alternate transaction, or if an alternate transaction is identified, such alternate transaction may not result in equivalent terms as compared to what is proposed in the Asset Sale Transaction;\n\u25cf\nthe trading price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Asset Sale Transaction will be consummated;\n\u25cf\nthe failure to complete the Asset Sale Transaction may create doubt as to our ability to effectively implement our current business strategies;\n\u25cf\nour costs related to the Asset Sale Transaction, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, must be paid even if the Asset Sale Transaction is not completed; and\n\u25cf\nour relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees may be damaged and our business may be harmed.\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nSome of our executive officers have interests in the Asset Sale Transaction that may be in addition to, or different from, the interests of our stockholders.\nStockholders should be aware that our executive officers have financial interests in the Asset Sale Transaction that may be in addition to, or different from, the interests of our stockholders generally. Each of Mr. Richardson and Mr. Newman is a party to the Asset Purchase Agreement. Our Board of Directors was aware of and considered these potential interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Asset Sale Transaction and Asset Purchase Agreement and in recommending to our stockholders that they approve the asset sale proposal.\nRisks Related to Our Business Prior to the Consummation of the AYRO Merger\nWe have a history of losses and may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and as of December 31, 2019, we have an accumulated deficit of $34.7 million. Such losses are continuing to date. We do not know if our business operations will become profitable or if we will continue to incur net losses in the future. Our management expects to incur significant expenses in the future in connection with the development and expansion of our business, which will make it difficult for us to achieve and maintain future profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described herein, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. Accordingly, there can be no certainty regarding if or when we will achieve profitability, or if such profitability will be sustained.\nHistorical losses and negative cash flows from operations raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nHistorically, we have suffered losses and have not generated positive cash flows from operations. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report of Friedman LLP for the year ended December 31, 2019 on our financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to predict future growth and operating results.\nWe have a relatively short operating history which makes it difficult to reliably predict future growth and operating results. We face all the risks commonly encountered by other businesses that lack an established operating history, including, without limitation, the need for additional capital and personnel and intense competition. There is no relevant history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that our business will be successful.\nWe will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have historically used substantial funds to develop our VAL platform and will require substantial additional funds to continue to develop our VAL platform and expand into new markets. Our future capital requirements and the period for which we expect our existing resources to support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect. Our monthly spending levels vary based on new and ongoing technology developments and corporate activities. To date, we have primarily financed our operations through sales of our securities. We may intend to seek additional funding in the future through equity or debt financings, credit or loan facilities or a combination of one or more of these financing sources. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of these stockholders. In addition, as a condition to providing us with additional funds, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and, in the event of insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of equity securities received any distribution of corporate assets.\nBecause our VAL platform operates in a relatively new market, we must actively seek market acceptance of our services, which we expect will occur gradually, if at all.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from our VAL platform, which is part of a relatively new and evolving market. Our services are substantially different from existing valet, parking, maintenance and car storage services and many potential clients may be reluctant to utilize our services until they have been tested in more established commercial operations over a significant period. As a result, we may have difficulty achieving market acceptance for our platform. If the market for our services fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, our business would be negatively affected.\nFuture growth may place significant demands on our management and infrastructure.\nOur business is logistically and technologically complex. This complexity has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure, and it may be challenging to sustain in future growth periods. Many of our systems and operational practices were implemented when the company was at a smaller scale of operations. In addition, as we grow, we must implement new systems and software to help run our operations and must hire additional personnel. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to continue to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of clients enhanced services, solutions and features. We may choose to commit significant financial, operational and technical resources in advance of an expected increase in the volume of our business, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. Growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for existing and new clients, which could adversely affect our reputation and business in the future. For example, in the past, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, situations where the demand for our services exceeded our estimates and our employee base was, and may in the future be, insufficient to support this higher demand. Our client experience and overall reputation could be harmed if we are unable to grow our employee base to support higher demand.\nCompetition for staffing, shortages of qualified drivers and union activity may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nIf our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Union activity is another factor that may contribute to increased labor costs. We currently do not have any union employees, and any increase in labor union activity could have a significant impact on our labor costs. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified drivers, or to control our labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDeterioration in economic conditions in general could reduce the demand for our services and damage our business and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in global, national and local economic conditions could negatively impact our business. Our business operations are concentrated and will likely continue to be concentrated in large urban areas, and business could be materially adversely affected to the extent that weak economic conditions result in the elimination of jobs and high unemployment in these large urban areas. If deteriorating economic conditions reduce discretionary spending, business travel or other economic activity that fuels demand for our services, our earnings could be reduced. Adverse changes in local and national economic conditions could also depress prices for our services or cause individual and/or corporate clients to cancel their agreements to purchase our services. Moreover, mandated changes in local and/or national compensation as it relates to minimum wage, overtime, and other compensation regulations may have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted by public health epidemics, including the recent coronavirus outbreak\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted if a public health epidemic, including the recent coronavirus outbreak, interferes with our ability, or the ability of our employees, workers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business. A public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk of disruptions from the temporary closure of third-party suppliers and manufacturers, restrictions on our employees' and other service providers' ability to travel, the decreased willingness or ability of our customers to travel or to utilize our services and shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nWe expect to face intense competition in the market for innovative logistics, valet and car storage services, and our business will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nWhile we believe that our platform offers a number of advantages over existing service providers, we expect that the competitive environment for our logistics, valet and storage services will become more intense as companies enter the market. In addition, there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. Currently, our primary competitors are public transportation, logistics, traditional valet and car storage providers, car sharing services and traditional rental car companies that have recently begun offering more innovative services. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition among our target clients and greater financial, technical and/or marketing resources than we have. Our competitors have resources that may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client preferences. These competitors could introduce new solutions with competitive prices or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns than us. Failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur long-term sustainability relies on our ability to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands.\nThe automotive industry, especially the vehicle support segment of the automotive industry in which we operate, is subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies. We believe that the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years. In addition to traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the entrance of non-traditional participants in the automotive industry. These non-traditional participants, such as ride-sharing companies and autonomous vehicles, may seek to disrupt the historic business model of the industry through the introduction of new technologies, new products or services, new business models or new methods of travel. To compete successfully, we will need to demonstrate the advantages of our services over alternative solutions and services, as well as newer technologies. Failure to adapt to innovations in technology and service offerings in the automotive space could have a material adverse impact on our ability to sustain our business and remain competitive.\nOur growth depends on our ability to gain sustained access to a sufficient number of parking locations on commercially reasonable terms that offer convenient access in reaching our clients.\nWe currently operate Self-park in New York City. We must therefore compete for limited parking locations. Many cities are densely populated, and parking locations may not be available at locations that provide convenient access to our clients or on terms that are commercially reasonable. If we are unable to gain sustained access to a sufficient number of parking locations that are convenient to our clients, our ability to attract and retain clients will suffer. This challenge of finding adequate parking will grow if we are able to successfully grow our subscriber base. If we are unable to gain sustained access to a sufficient number of parking locations, or we are unable to gain such access on commercially reasonable terms, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully execute our growth strategy, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nTo date, we primarily operate in the New York metropolitan area. Our growth strategy includes expanding our services to new geographic locations, which may not succeed due to various factors, including one or more of the following: competition, our inability to build brand name recognition in these new markets, our inability to effectively market our services in these new markets or our inability to deliver high-quality services on a cost-effective, continuous and consistent basis. In addition, we may be unable to identify new cities with sufficient growth potential to expand our network, and we may fail to attract quality drivers and other employees and/or establish the necessary commercial relationships with local vendors that are required in order to deliver our services in these areas. If we fail to successfully execute our growth strategy, we may be unable to maintain and grow our business operation, and our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may experience difficulties demonstrating the value to customers of newer, higher priced and higher margin services if they believe existing services are adequate to meet end customer expectations.\nAs we develop and introduces new services, we faces the risk that customers may not value or be willing to purchase these higher priced and higher margin services due to pricing constraints. Owing to the extensive time and resources that we invest in developing new services, if we are unable to sell customers new services, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be negatively affected.\nIf efforts to build and maintain strong brand identity are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain clients, and our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that building and maintaining our brand is critical to the success of our business. Consumer client and automotive awareness of the brand and its perceived value will depend largely on the success of marketing efforts and the ability to provide a consistent, high-quality client and business experience. Conversely, any failure to maximize marketing opportunities or to provide clients with high-quality valet, logistics, maintenance and storage experiences for any reason could substantially harm our reputation and adversely affect our efforts to develop as a trusted brand. To promote our brand, we have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments relating to advertising, marketing and other efforts, but cannot be sure that such investment will be successful.\nFurthermore, as the primary point of contact with clients, we rely on our drivers to provide clients and business partners with a high-quality client experience. The failure of our drivers to provide clients and business partners with this trusted experience could cause customers and business partners to turn to alternative providers, including our competitors. Any incident that erodes consumer affinity for our brand, including a negative experience with one of our valets or damage to a customer\u2019s car could result in negative publicity, negative online reviews and damage our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers to provide parking garages for our clients\u2019 cars. If these service providers experience operational difficulties or disruptions, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on third-party service providers to provide parking garages for our clients\u2019 cars. In particular, we rely on local parking garage vendors to provide adequate convenient parking locations. We do not control the operation of these providers. If these third-party service providers terminate their relationship with us, decide to sell their facilities or do not provide convenient access to our clients\u2019 vehicles, it would be disruptive to our business, as we are dependent on suitable parking locations within relative proximity of our clients\u2019 residences and business locations. This disruption could harm our reputation and brand and may cause us to lose clients.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our business-to-business (B2B) model, our revenue growth could be adversely affected.\nWe currently depend on corporate clients and the B2B market for a significant portion of our revenue. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to maintain existing B2B partners, obtain new B2B partners, and generate a community of participating corporate clients sufficiently large to support such a model. We may not be successful in establishing such partnerships on terms that are commercially favorable, if at all, and may encounter financial and logistical difficulties associated with sustaining such partnerships. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our B2B model, our revenue growth could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks related to liabilities resulting from the use of client vehicles by our employees.\nOur business can expose us to claims for property damage, personal injury and death resulting from the operation and storage of client cars by our drivers. While operating client cars, drivers could become involved in motor vehicle accidents due to mechanical or manufacturing defects, or user error by our employed driver or by a third-party driver that results in death or significant property damage for which we may be liable.\nIn addition, we depend on our drivers to inspect the vehicles prior to driving in order to identify any potential damage or safety concern with the vehicle. To the extent that we are found at fault or otherwise responsible for an accident, our insurance coverage would only cover losses up to a maximum of $5 million, in certain instances, in the United States.\nWe may experience difficulty obtaining coverage for certain insurable risks or obtaining such coverage at a reasonable cost.\nWe maintain insurance for workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, automobile liability, property damage and other insurable risks. We are responsible for claims exceeding our retained limits under our insurance policies, and while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage corresponding to our assessment of risk, we cannot predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims or direct or consequential damages and may become exposed to liability at levels in excess of our historical levels resulting from unusually high losses or otherwise. Additionally, consolidation of entities in the insurance industry could impact our ability to obtain or renew policies at competitive rates, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, as would the incurrence of uninsured claims or the inability or refusal of our insurance carriers to pay otherwise insured claims. Any material changes in our insurance costs due to changes in frequency of claims, the severity of claims, the costs of premiums or for any other reason could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur success depends on the continued reliability of the internet infrastructure.\nOur services are designed primarily to work over the internet, and the success of our platform is largely dependent on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure, along with our clients\u2019 access to low-cost, high-speed internet. The future delivery of our services will depend on third-party internet service providers to expand high-speed internet access, to maintain a reliable network with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, and to develop complementary products and services for providing reliable and timely internet access. Any outages or delays resulting from damage to the internet infrastructure, including problems caused by viruses, malware and similar programs, could reduce clients\u2019 access to the internet and our services and could adversely impact our business.\nSystem interruptions that impair access to our website or mobile application could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our website and mobile application, which enable clients to access our services, are critical to our business. Any systems interruption that prevents clients and visitors from accessing our website and mobile App could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation and brand and could cause our business and operating results to suffer. We may experience system interruptions for a variety of reasons, including network failures, power outages, cyber-attacks, problems caused by viruses and similar programs, software errors or an overwhelming number of clients or visitors trying to reach our website during periods of strong demand. Because we are dependent in part on third parties for the implementation and maintenance of certain aspects of our systems and because some of the causes of system interruptions may be outside of our control, we may not be able to remedy such interruptions in a timely manner, or at all. Any significant disruption to our website, mobile application or internal computer systems could result in a loss of clients and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect confidential client information, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to liability and a loss of clients.\nOur system stores, processes and transmits confidential client information, including location information and other sensitive data. We rely on encryption, authentication and other technologies to keep this information secure. We may not have adequately assessed the internal and external risks posed to the security of our systems and may not have implemented adequate preventative safeguards. In the event that the security of our system is compromised in the future, we may not take adequate reactionary measures. Any compromise of information security could expose our confidential client information, damaging our reputation and exposing the company to costly litigation and liability that could harm our business and operating results.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevents us from accessing critical information or exposes us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe utilize information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information in connection with our business activities. As the use of digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, all of which are vital to our operations and business strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing cyber-attacks or successfully mitigating their effects.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contract research organizations and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage or disruption from hacking, computer viruses, software bugs, unauthorized access or disclosure, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication, equipment and electrical failures. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will promptly detect any such disruption or security breach, if at all. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, and manage various general and administrative aspects of our business. To the extent that any such disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure or theft of confidential, proprietary or personal information, we could incur liability, suffer reputational damage or poor financial performance or become the subject of regulatory actions by state, federal or non-US authorities, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nFuture legislation or regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAlthough various jurisdictions and government agencies are considering implementing legislation in response to the rise of other ride- and car-sharing enterprises, such as Uber Technologies Inc., currently no such legislation exists that we believe has jurisdiction over, or applicability to, our operations. We do not believe we are subject to any material government regulations or oversight, but regulations impacting parking and traffic patterns in the areas of our operations could impact the services we provide. We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to environmental, health and safety, financial, tax, customs and other matters. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretations thereof, could increase the costs of doing business for us or our clients or otherwise restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nWe generally experience some effects of seasonality due to increases in travel during the summer months and holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas. Accordingly, the use of our services and associated revenue have generally increased at a higher rate during such periods. Our revenue also fluctuates due to inclement weather conditions, such as snow or rain storms. This seasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and the loss of one or more members of our management team, or our failure to attract, integrate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.\nWe believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, technical, finance and sales and marketing personnel. We currently depend on the continued services and performance of the key members of our management team, including Spencer Richardson, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, and David Newman, our Co-Founder and Chief Business Development Officer. The loss of any key personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow the business.\nPrior to the second quarter in 2018, we relied on outside consultants and other service providers for the majority of our accounting and financial support. During 2018, we hired new members to our management team. In February of 2019, we terminated our Chief Financial Officer and, on the same day, engaged a consultant to serve as our Chief Financial Officer going forward. We compete in the market for personnel against numerous companies, including larger, more established competitors who have significantly greater financial resources and may be in a better financial position to offer higher compensation packages to attract and retain human capital. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business effectively in the future.\nWe may become engaged in legal proceedings that could result in unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention.\nFrom time to time, we may become subject to litigation, claims or other proceedings that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, could occupy a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\nOur business is subject to interruptions, delays and failures resulting from natural or man-made disasters.\nOur services, systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, volcanoes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events. A significant natural disaster could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. As we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide a high-quality client experience, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run the business, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe have incurred significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to public company compliance requirements.\nAs a public company, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including the requirements of Section 404, and rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and The Nasdaq Capital Market require public companies to meet certain corporate governance standards. A number of those requirements necessitate our management to carry out activities we have not done previously. For example, we have adopted new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costlier. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. We are required to make our annual assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 as of December 31, 2019.\nTo comply with the requirements of Sections 302 and 404, we have undertaken or may in the future undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal controls can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. In addition, when evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Sections 302 and 404. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Sections 302 and 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if it becomes necessary for our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and is unable to do so, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by The Nasdaq Capital Market, SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nA material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to adequately mitigate risk of fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and adequately mitigate risk of fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective due to the material weaknesses resulting from a limited segregation of duties among our employees with respect to our control activities and this deficiency is the result of our limited number of employees. We also identified material weaknesses surrounding the financial closing process and the recording of debt and equity transactions that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2019. These deficiencies may affect our management\u2019s ability to determine if errors or inappropriate actions have taken place.\nProvisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of the company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult for you to change management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nthe exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;\n\u25cf\na requirement that special meetings of our stockholders be called only by the chairman of our Board of Directors, our Board of Directors or a committee of our Board of Directors to whom such authority has been delegated;\n\u25cf\nan advance notice requirement for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u25cf\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our Board of Directors may determine; and\n\u25cf\na requirement of approval of not less than 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote to amend any bylaws by stockholder action.\nIn addition, our amended and restated bylaws, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on Our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). It could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories enumerated in the exclusive forum provision and asserts claims under the Securities Act, inasmuch as Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rule and regulations thereunder. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision with respect to claims under the Securities Act, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProvisions in our charter and other provisions of Delaware law could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nOur ability to use NOLs may be limited.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had approximately $17.0 million of operating loss carryforwards for federal and approximately $17.0 million for New York state tax purposes that may be applied against future taxable income. The NOLs will begin to expire in the year 2037 if not utilized prior to that date. To the extent available, we intend to use these NOLs to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. The ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited under Section 382 of the Code, which apply if an ownership change occurs. It is expected that the AYRO Merger will impose a limitation on the utilization of our NOLs under Section 382 of the Code. To the extent our use of NOLs is significantly limited, our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use NOLs, which could have a negative effect on our financial results.\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d or TCJA, which significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and NOLs, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. Our net deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate, and the estimated impact was recognized in our tax expense in 2017. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. However, the effect of the TCJA on our business, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period of time. We urge investors to consult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implications of the TCJA on an investment in our common stock.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our common stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nBased on the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 25, 2020, our officers and directors, together with holders of 5% or more of our common stock outstanding and our respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 35% of our common stock, which reflects 9.99% beneficial ownership limitations included in certain company instruments. Accordingly, these stockholders have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control of the company, even if such a change of control would benefit the other stockholders, which could deprive such other stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the company or company assets and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by other companies involving similar technologies. The stock market in general and the market for smaller companies, like us in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of our most recent filings with the SEC, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf\nissuances of new equity securities pursuant to a future offering, including issuances of preferred stock;\n\u25cf\nthe success of competitive products, services or technologies;\n\u25cf\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf\nadverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to the services we provide;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nvariations in the costs of the services we provide;\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions in the market segments in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nvariations in quarterly and annual operating results;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of our new products and/or services or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u25cf\nchanges in analysts\u2019 earnings estimates;\n\u25cf\nshort selling shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nlitigation;\n\u25cf\nchanging the exchange or quotation system on which shares of our common stock are listed;\n\u25cf\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by the company, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets.\nIn addition, broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and factors beyond our control may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have frequently been the objects of securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Class action and derivative lawsuits could result in substantial costs to the company and cause a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nOur business depends substantially on our intellectual property rights, the protection of which is crucial to our business success. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely or may in the future rely on a combination of trademark law and trade secret protection, copyright law and patent law. We also utilize contractual agreements, including, in certain circumstances, confidentiality agreements between the company and our employees, independent contractors and other advisors. These afford only limited protection, and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website and mobile application features, software and functionality, or to obtain and use information that we consider proprietary or confidential, such as the technology used to operate our website, our content and company trademarks. We may also encounter difficulties in connection with the acquisition and maintenance of domain names, and regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights.\nIn addition, we may become subject to third-party claims that we infringe the proprietary rights of others. Such claims, regardless of their merits, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us or the payment of damages. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.", "PERMNO": 90640, "SIC": 7500, "TIC": "DCAR"}
