{"cik": "55772", "company": "KIMBALL INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following important risk factors could affect future results and events, causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be carefully considered before deciding to invest in, or retain, shares of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about, we currently believe are immaterial or we have not predicted may also affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance.\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements and noncompliance could expose us to liability or impede current or future business. The U.S. government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either at their discretion or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract, which could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders. The failure to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements could subject us to investigations, fines, or other penalties, and violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting.\nIn March 2016, in connection with a renewal of one of our contracts with the GSA, we became aware of noncompliance and inaccuracies in our GSA subcontractor reporting. Accordingly, we retained outside legal counsel to assist in conducting an internal review of our reporting practices, and we self-reported the matter and the results of the internal review to the GSA. We have promptly responded to inquiries from the GSA since our initial reporting, and we intend to cooperate fully with any further inquiries or investigations. While we are not able to reasonably estimate the future financial impact, if any, of the possible sanctions at this time, any of them could, if imposed, have a material adverse impact on our business, future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The timing of the government\u2019s review and determination of any outcome of these matters is uncertain and, therefore, it is unclear as to when and to what extent, if any, our previously issued earnings guidance might be impacted. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, legal and related costs in connection with our internal review and the government\u2019s response to this matter. During fiscal year 2016, sales related to our GSA contracts were approximately 8.9% of total Kimball International, Inc. sales, with one contract accounting for approximately 5.0% of total Kimball International, Inc. sales and the other contract accounting for approximately 3.9% of Kimball International, Inc. sales.\nIf the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken relating to the spin-off do not qualify as tax-free transactions, the Company, its Share Owners as of the distribution date, and Kimball Electronics could be subject to substantial tax liabilities. On October 10, 2014 the Company received a favorable written tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) that the Company\u2019s stock unification in connection with the spin-off will not cause the Company to recognize income or gain as a result of the unification. In addition, the Company has also received an opinion of Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP to the effect that the distribution satisfies the requirements to qualify as a tax-free transaction (except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares) for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the Company, the Company\u2019s Share Owners and Kimball Electronics under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nThe tax ruling and the tax opinion rely on the accuracy of certain factual representations and assumptions provided by the Company and Kimball Electronics in connection with obtaining the tax ruling and tax opinion, including with respect to post-spin-off operations and conduct of the parties. If these factual representations and assumptions are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the tax ruling and/or the tax opinion.\nFurthermore, the tax opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the tax opinion. If, notwithstanding our receipt of the tax opinion, the spin-off is determined to be taxable, then (i) the Company would be subject to tax as if it sold the Kimball Electronics common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value; and (ii) each Share Owner who received Kimball Electronics common stock would be treated as receiving a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Kimball Electronics common stock that would generally result in varied tax liabilities for each Share Owner depending on the facts and circumstances.\nEven if the spin-off does qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution will be taxable to the Company (but not to the Company\u2019s Share Owners) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there are one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of the stock of either the Company or Kimball Electronics, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of the then-outstanding stock of either the Company or Kimball Electronics and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% Share Owners and certain compensatory stock issuances) generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. The resulting tax liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Kimball Electronics that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of us and Kimball Electronics after the spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the spin-off or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off do not qualify as tax-free transactions. Though valid as between us and Kimball Electronics, the Tax Matters Agreement will not be binding on the IRS.\nPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, (i) we have agreed (a) not to enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spin-off to be taxable to Kimball Electronics, including under Section 355(e) of the Code; (b) to indemnify Kimball Electronics for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions entered into by us; and (ii) Kimball Electronics has agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions entered into by Kimball Electronics. In addition, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Company\u2019s consolidated group at the time of the spin-off (including Kimball Electronics) would be jointly and severally liable for the resulting U.S. federal income tax liability if all or a portion of the spin-off does not or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off do not qualify as tax-free transactions. These obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company.\nIf Kimball Electronics were to default in its obligation to us to pay taxes under the Tax Matters Agreement, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of tax liabilities. To the extent we are responsible for any liability under the Tax Matters Agreement, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results or operations and cash flows.\nUncertain macroeconomic and industry conditions could adversely impact demand for our products and adversely affect operating results. Market demand for our products, which impacts revenues and gross profit, is influenced by a variety of economic and industry factors such as:\n\u2022\nweakness in the global financial markets;\n\u2022\nvolatility and the cyclical nature of worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022\nuncertainty of the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) as a result of a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d;\n\u2022\nglobal consumer confidence;\n\u2022\ngeneral corporate profitability of the end markets to which we sell;\n\u2022\ncredit availability to the end markets to which we sell;\n\u2022\nwhite-collar unemployment rates;\n\u2022\ncommercial property vacancy rates;\n\u2022\nnew office construction and refurbishment rates;\n\u2022\ndeficit status of many governmental entities which may result in declining purchases of office furniture; and\n\u2022\nnew hotel and casino construction and refurbishment rates.\nWe must make decisions based on order volumes in order to achieve efficiency in manufacturing capacities. These decisions include determining what level of additional business to accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, and personnel requirements, among various other considerations. We must constantly monitor the changing economic landscape and may modify our strategic direction based upon the changing business environment. If we do not react quickly enough to the changes in market or economic conditions, it could result in lost customers, decreased market share, and increased operating costs.\nWe may be exposed to the credit risk of our customers who are adversely affected by weakness in market conditions. Weakness in market conditions may drive an elevated risk of potential bankruptcy of our customers resulting in a greater risk of uncollectible outstanding accounts receivable. Accordingly, we closely monitor our receivables and related credit risks. The realization of these risks could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nReduction of purchases by or the loss of a significant number of customers could reduce revenues and profitability. Significant declines in the level of purchases by customers or the loss of a significant number of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. A reduction of government spending could also have an adverse impact on our sales levels. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fully replace any lost sales, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete successfully. The office and hospitality furniture industries are competitive due to numerous global manufacturers competing in the marketplace. In times of reduced demand for office furniture, large competitors may apply more pressure to their aligned distribution to sell their products exclusively which could lead to reduced opportunities for our products. While we work toward reducing costs to respond to pricing pressures, if we cannot achieve the proportionate reductions in costs, profit margins may suffer.\nWe may be unable to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and components for use in our products at a competitive price, in a timely manner, or at all. We depend on suppliers globally to provide timely delivery of materials, parts, and components for use in our products. We monitor the financial stability of suppliers when feasible as the loss of a significant supplier could have an adverse impact on our operations. Certain finished products and components we purchase are primarily manufactured in select regions of the world and issues in those regions could cause manufacturing delays. In addition, delays can occur related to the transport of products and components via container ships, which load and unload\nthrough various U.S. ports which sometimes experience congestion. Price increases of commodity components could have an adverse impact on our profitability if we cannot offset such increases with other cost reductions or by price increases to customers. Materials we utilize are generally available, but future availability is unknown and could impact our ability to meet customer order requirements. If suppliers fail to meet commitments to us in terms of price, delivery, or quality, it could interrupt our operations and negatively impact our ability to meet commitments to customers.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of fuel and other energy sources. The cost of energy is a critical component of freight expense and the cost of operating manufacturing facilities. Increases in the cost of energy could reduce our profitability.\nWe are subject to manufacturing inefficiencies due to the transfer of production among our facilities and other factors. At times we may experience labor or other manufacturing inefficiencies due to factors such as new product introductions, transfers of production among our manufacturing facilities, a sudden decline in sales, a new operating system, or turnover in personnel. Manufacturing inefficiencies could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nA change in our sales mix among various products could have a negative impact on our gross profit margin. Changes in product sales mix could negatively impact our gross margin as margins of different products vary. We strive to improve the margins of all products, but certain products have lower margins in order to price the product competitively. An increase in the proportion of sales of products with lower margins could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur restructuring efforts may not be successful. We continually evaluate our manufacturing capabilities and capacities in relation to current and anticipated market conditions. A critical component of our restructuring initiatives is the transfer of production among facilities which may result in some manufacturing inefficiencies and excess working capital during the transition period. The successful execution of restructuring initiatives is dependent on various factors and may not be accomplished as quickly or effectively as anticipated.\nWe may pursue acquisitions that present risks and may not be successful. Our sales growth plans may occur through both organic growth and acquisitions. Acquisitions involve many risks that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in identifying suitable acquisition candidates and in negotiating and consummating acquisitions on terms attractive to us;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the operations of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of resources, including diverting management\u2019s attention from our current operations;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering new geographic or product markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key customers of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe potential incurrence of indebtedness to fund the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe potential issuance of common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute ownership interests of our current Share Owners;\n\u2022\nthe acquired business not achieving anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flow, or market share;\n\u2022\nexcess capacity;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of undisclosed liabilities; and\n\u2022\ndilution of earnings.\nIf efforts to introduce new products are not successful, this could limit sales growth or cause sales to decline. We regularly introduce new products to keep pace with workplace trends and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, and safety standards such as sustainability and ergonomic considerations, and similar standards for the workplace and for product performance. Shifts in workforce demographics, working styles, and technology may impact the types of office furniture products purchased by our customers as smaller and more collaborative workstations gain popularity. The introduction of new products requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing, and marketing of such products. The design and engineering required for certain new products can take an extended period of time, and further time may be required to achieve customer acceptance. Accordingly, the launch of any particular product may be delayed or may be less successful than we originally anticipated. Difficulties or delays in introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit sales growth or cause sales to decline.\nIf customers do not perceive our products and services to be innovative and of high quality, our brand and name recognition and reputation could suffer. We believe that establishing and maintaining good brand and name recognition and a good reputation is critical to our business. Promotion and enhancement of our name and brands will depend on the\neffectiveness of marketing and advertising efforts and on successfully providing design driven, innovative, and high quality products and superior services. If customers do not perceive our products and services to be design driven, innovative, and of high quality, our reputation, brand and name recognition could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA loss of independent manufacturing representatives, dealers, or other sales channels could lead to a decline in sales. Our office furniture is marketed primarily through Company salespersons to end users, office furniture dealers, wholesalers, rental companies, and catalog houses. Our hospitality furniture is marketed to end users using independent manufacturing representatives. A significant loss within any of these sales channels could result in a sales decline and thus have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFailure to effectively manage working capital may adversely affect our cash flow from operations. We closely monitor inventory and receivable efficiencies and continuously strive to improve these measures of working capital, but customer financial difficulties, cancellation or delay of customer orders, transfers of production among our manufacturing facilities, or manufacturing delays could adversely affect our cash flow from operations.\nWe may not be able to achieve maximum utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Fluctuations and deferrals of customer orders may have a material adverse effect on our ability to utilize our fixed capacity and thus negatively impact our operating margins.\nWe could incur losses due to asset impairment. As business conditions change, we must continually evaluate and work toward the optimum asset base. It is possible that certain assets such as, but not limited to, facilities, equipment, or intangible assets, could be impaired at some point in the future depending on changing business conditions. Such impairment could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, mainly in the United States. Judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes, other tax liabilities, interest, and penalties. Future events could change management\u2019s assessment. We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We have also made assumptions about the realization of deferred tax assets. Changes in these assumptions could result in a valuation allowance for these assets. Final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is currently reflected by our income tax provisions and accruals.\nA failure to comply with the financial covenants under the Company\u2019s $30 million credit facility could adversely impact the Company. Our credit facility requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants. We believe the most significant covenants under this credit facility are the adjusted leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio. More detail on these financial covenants is discussed in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings under this credit facility and we had $1.4 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. At June 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $47.6 million. In the future, a default on the financial covenants under our credit facility could cause an increase in the borrowing rates or could make it more difficult for us to secure future financing which could adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.\nOur business depends on effective information technology systems which also are intended to minimize the risk of a security breach or cybersecurity threat, including the misappropriation of assets or other sensitive information, or data corruption which could cause operational disruption. Information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with changes in information processing technology and evolving industry standards. We cannot guarantee that our security measures will effectively prevent others from obtaining unauthorized access to our information and our customers\u2019 information. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and are not often recognized until after they have been launched. Any breach of information technology systems could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or increase costs related to the mitigation of, response to, or litigation arising from any such issue.\nAdditionally, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft. Also, as our business expands globally, we are subject to data privacy and other similar laws in various foreign jurisdictions. If we are the target of a cybersecurity attack resulting in unauthorized disclosure of our customer data, we may be required to undertake costly notification procedures. Compliance with these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business. If we fail to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could undermine our competitive position. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party non-disclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States, and therefore in some parts of the world, we have limited protections, if any, for our intellectual property. Competing effectively depends, to a significant extent, on maintaining the proprietary nature of our intellectual property. The degree of protection offered by our various patents and trademarks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Company, and patents or trademarks may not be issued on pending or contemplated applications. In addition, not all of our products are covered by patents. It is also possible that our patents and trademarks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed, or circumvented.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their intellectual property rights and incur substantial litigation or other costs. We could be notified of a claim regarding intellectual property rights which could lead us to spend time and money to defend or address the claim. Even if the claim is without merit, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nOur insurance may not adequately protect us from liabilities related to product defects. We maintain product liability and other insurance coverage that we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices, but our insurance coverage does not extend to field visits to repair, retrofit or replace defective products, or to product recalls. As a result, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial claims and costs that may arise from liabilities related to product defects, particularly if we have a large number of defective products that we must repair, retrofit, replace, or recall.\nIncreases in the cost of providing employee healthcare benefits have reduced and may continue to reduce our profitability. There may continue to be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to our employees. We are self-insured for healthcare benefits so Kimball incurs the cost of claims, including catastrophic claims that may occasionally occur, with employees bearing only a limited portion of healthcare costs through employee healthcare premium withholdings. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation and significant potential environmental liabilities. Our past and present operation and ownership of manufacturing plants and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. In addition, the increased prevalence of global climate issues may result in new regulations that may negatively impact us. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist with respect to our facilities and real property. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require additional expenditures, some of which could be material. In addition, any investigations or remedial efforts relating to environmental matters could involve material costs or otherwise result in material liabilities.\nOur failure to retain the existing management team, maintain our engineering, technical, and manufacturing process expertise, or continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business. We depend significantly on our executive officers and other key personnel. Our success is also dependent on keeping pace with technological advancements and adapting services to provide manufacturing capabilities which meet customers\u2019 changing needs. To do that, we must retain our qualified engineering and technical personnel and successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner. Our culture and guiding principles focus on continuous training, motivating, and development of employees, and we strive to attract, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. Failure to retain our executive officers and retain and attract other key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nTurnover in personnel could cause manufacturing inefficiencies. The demand for manufacturing labor in certain geographic areas makes retaining experienced production employees difficult. Turnover could result in additional training and inefficiencies that could impact our operating results.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may impact our production schedules and, in turn, negatively impact profitability. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise our ability to produce or deliver products. Our manufacturing operations require significant amounts of energy, including natural gas and oil, and governmental regulations may control the allocation of such fuels. Employees are an integral part of our business and events such as a pandemic could reduce the availability of employees reporting for work. In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or\ndeliver product, revenues could be reduced, and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, catastrophic events, or the threat thereof, can adversely affect U.S. and world economies, and could result in delayed or lost sales of our products. In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect the ability to receive and process customer orders, manufacture products, and ship products on a timely basis, and could adversely affect relations with our customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers. We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these matters, but such may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner to us in the event of such an interruption.\nImposition of government regulations may significantly increase our operating costs in the United States and abroad. Legislative and regulatory reforms by the U.S. federal and foreign governments could significantly impact our profitability by burdening us with forced cost choices that cannot be recovered by increased pricing. For example:\n\u2022\nWe import a portion of our wooden furniture products and are thus subject to an antidumping tariff on wooden bedroom furniture supplied from China. The tariffs are subject to review and could result in retroactive and prospective tariff rate increases which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022\nForeign regulations are increasing in many areas such as data privacy, hazardous waste disposal, labor relations and employment practices. Compliance with these regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nProvisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to \u201cConflict Minerals\u201d may increase our costs and reduce our sales levels. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries that are believed to benefit armed groups. As a result, the SEC has adopted due diligence, disclosure, and reporting requirements for companies which manufacture products that include components containing such minerals, regardless of whether the minerals are actually mined in the DRC or adjoining countries. We have determined that certain of our products contain such specified minerals, and we have developed a process to comply with the SEC regulations. Such regulations could decrease the availability and increase the prices of components used in our products, particularly if we choose (or are required by our customers) to source such components from different suppliers than we use now. In addition, as our supply chain is complex and the process to comply with the SEC rules is cumbersome, the ongoing compliance process is both time-consuming and costly. We may face reduced sales if we are unable to timely verify the origins of minerals contained in the components included in our products.\nThe value of our common stock may experience substantial fluctuations for reasons over which we may have little control. The value of common stock could fluctuate substantially based on a variety of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our Company, competitors, or industry;\n\u2022\noverall volatility of the stock market;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial estimates of securities analysts or investors regarding our Company, the industry, or competitors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market or economic conditions.\nFurthermore, stock prices for many companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results. These fluctuations, coupled with changes in results of operations and general economic, political, and market conditions, may adversely affect the value of our Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 47715, "SIC": 2520, "TIC": "KBAL"}
