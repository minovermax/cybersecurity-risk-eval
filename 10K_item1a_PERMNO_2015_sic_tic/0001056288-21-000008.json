{"cik": "1056288", "company": "FEDERATED HERMES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAs an investment manager, risk is an inherent part of Federated Hermes' business. U.S., UK and other global financial/securities, capital, commodities, currency, real estate, credit and other markets (collectively, as applicable, markets), by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. If any of the following risks actually occur, Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only risks involved in Federated Hermes' business. Additional risks not presently known to Federated Hermes or that Federated Hermes currently considers to be immaterial can also adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nSpecific Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Federated Hermes' Investment Management Business\nPotential Adverse Effects of a Material Concentration in Revenue. At any point in time, a meaningful or significant portion of Federated Hermes' total AUM or revenue can be attributable to one or more products or strategies, or asset classes, offered by Federated Hermes, or one or more clients or customer intermediaries with whom Federated Hermes has a relationship. See Note (5) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on material concentrations in Federated Hermes' revenue. A significant and prolonged decline in the AUM of a strategy, asset class or product with a material concentration could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' future revenues and, to a lesser extent, net income, due to a related reduction in distribution expenses associated with these strategies, assets and funds. Likewise, significant negative changes in Federated Hermes' relationship with a customer with a material concentration could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' future revenues and, to a lesser extent, net income due to a related reduction in distribution expenses associated with this customer. A significant change in Federated Hermes' investment management business or a significant reduction in AUM due to regulatory changes or developments, changes in the markets, such as significant and rapid increases in interest rates over a short period of time causing certain investors to prefer direct investments in interest-bearing securities, non-competitive performance, declines in asset or real estate property values, the availability, supply and/or market interest in repurchase agreements and other investments, significant deterioration in investor confidence, continuing declining or prolonged periods of low short-term interest rates or negative interest rates or negative yields and resulting fee waivers, investor preferences for deposit products or other Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured products, or exchange-traded funds, index funds or other passive investment products, changes in product fee structures, changes in relationships with financial intermediaries, or other circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/ or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effect of Providing Financial Support to Investment Products. Federated Hermes can, from time to time, elect to provide financial support to its sponsored investment products (such as the Federated Hermes Funds). Providing such support utilizes capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses resulting from such support, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products, could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRisk of Federated Hermes' Money Market Products' Ability to Maintain a Stable Net Asset Value. Approximately 40% of Federated Hermes' total revenue for 2020 was attributable to money market assets. An investment in money market funds is neither insured nor guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Federated Hermes' retail and government/public debt money market funds, as well as its private and collective money market funds, seek to maintain a stable or constant NAV. Federated Hermes also offers non-U.S. low volatility money market funds that seek to maintain a constant NAV, but will move to a four-digit NAV if such fund's net asset value falls outside of a twenty basis point collar. Although stable or constant NAV money market funds seek to maintain a NAV of $1.00 per share, it is possible for an investor to lose money by investing in these funds. Federated Hermes also offers institutional prime or municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds which transact at a fluctuating NAV that uses four-decimal-place precision ($1.0000). Federated Hermes also offers a short-term variable NAV non-U.S. money market fund. It is possible for an investor to lose money by investing in these funds. Federated Hermes devotes substantial resources, such as significant credit analysis, consideration of ESG factors and attention to security valuation in connection with the management of its products and strategies. However, the NAV of an institutional prime or municipal (or tax-exempt) money market fund, or variable NAV fund or, if the above described conditions are met, a low-volatility NAV fund, can fluctuate, and there is no guarantee that a government/public debt or retail (i.e., stable or constant NAV) money market fund, or a low-volatility money market fund, will be able to preserve a stable or constant NAV in the future. Market conditions could lead to a limited supply of money market securities and severe liquidity issues and/or declines in interest rates or additional prolonged periods of low yields in money market products or strategies, and regulatory changes or developments could lead to shifts in asset levels and mix, which could impact money market fund NAVs and performance. If the NAV of a Federated Hermes stable or constant NAV money market fund were to decline to less than $1.00 per share, such Federated\nHermes money market fund would likely experience significant redemptions, resulting in reductions in AUM, loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. It is also possible that, if the fluctuating NAV of an institutional prime or municipal (or tax-exempt) money market fund, or variable NAV money market fund or low volatility money market fund consistently or significantly declines to less than $1.0000 per share, such Federated Hermes money market fund could experience significant redemptions, resulting in reductions in AUM, loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Increased Competition in the Investment Management Business. The investment management business is highly competitive. Federated Hermes competes in the management and distribution of investment products and strategies (such as mutual funds, collective funds, private equity funds, infrastructure funds, other pooled investment vehicles and Separate Accounts), stewardship services and real estate development services with other fund management companies and investment advisors, national and regional broker/dealers, commercial banks, insurance companies and other institutions. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and brand recognition than Federated Hermes. Competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, quality of service, the strength and continuity of management and selling relationships, distribution services offered, technological innovation (e.g., the use of financial technology, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and data science in managing and distributing products and strategies), the type (e.g., passive- versus actively-managed, fund versus FDIC-insured deposits) and range of products and strategies offered and fees charged. As with any highly competitive market, competitive pricing structures are important. If competitors charge lower fees for similar products or strategies, Federated Hermes has reduced, or could decide to further reduce, the fees on its own products or strategies (either directly on a gross basis or on a net basis through fee waivers) for competitive purposes in order to retain or attract customers. Increased competition also can require changes in Federated Hermes' business model, products (e.g., launching ETFs) or strategies to respond to competition from existing and new market innovations and competitors, which can increase expenses and creates the risk that such changes will not be successful or Federated Hermes will not achieve its long-term strategic objectives. Such fee reductions, changes in business models or strategies, or other effects of competition, or failures to adequately adjust business practices, products or services to meet competition, could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nMany of Federated Hermes' products and strategies are designed for use by institutions such as banks, insurance companies and other corporations. A large portion of Federated Hermes' managed assets, particularly money market, fixed-income and alternative/private markets assets, are held by institutional investors. If or when the structure of institutional investment products, such as money market funds, changes or becomes disfavored by institutions, whether due to regulatory or market changes, competing products (such as insured deposit products or non-transparent, actively managed ETFs) or otherwise, Federated Hermes could be unable to retain or grow its share of this market and this could adversely affect Federated Hermes' future profitability and have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Certain of Federated Hermes' products and strategies also can be impact oriented and might not be suitable investments for certain fiduciary customers without obtaining appropriate consent. This can limit Federated Hermes' ability to market or grow assets in such products and this could adversely affect Federated Hermes' future profitability and affect, potentially in a material way, Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nA significant portion of Federated Hermes' revenue is derived from providing products (such as mutual funds) and strategies to the U.S. Financial Intermediary market, comprising over 11,000 institutions and intermediaries. The future profitability of Federated Hermes will be adversely affected if it is unable to retain or grow its share of this market and could also be adversely affected by consolidations in the banking and securities industries, as well as regulatory changes or developments impacting its customers.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Changes in Federated Hermes' Distribution Channels. Federated Hermes acts as a wholesaler of investment products and strategies to financial intermediaries, including, for example, banks, broker/dealers, registered investment advisors and other financial planners. Federated Hermes also sells investment products and strategies, and stewardship services and real estate development services, directly to corporations, institutions, government agencies, and other customers. There can be no assurance that any product diversification efforts (whether to Federated Hermes' fund line-up or geographically), ESG positioning or investments in data and analytics to bolster Federated Hermes' distribution efforts will be successful. There also can be no assurance that Federated Hermes will continue to have access to any financial intermediary or financial intermediaries that currently distribute Federated Hermes products and strategies, that Federated Hermes' relationship with any one or more financial intermediaries or other customers will continue over time or on existing economic terms, or that Federated Hermes' sales or distribution efforts will achieve any particular level of success. The impact of Voluntary Yield-\nrelated Fee Waivers, other waivers for competitive purposes, and related reductions in distribution expense can vary depending upon, among other variables, changes in distribution models, changes in the distribution fee arrangements with one or more financial intermediaries, changes in customer relationships and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by one or more financial intermediaries. In addition, exclusive of the impacts of waivers and related reductions in distribution expense, Federated Hermes has experienced increases in the cost of distribution as a percentage of total fund revenue from 31% in 2019 to 32% in 2020. Federated Hermes expects such costs to continue to increase in total due to asset growth, and per dollar of revenue earned due to the competitive pressures of the investment management business. Higher distribution costs reduce Federated Hermes' operating and net income.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Declines in the Amount of or Changes in the Mix of Assets under Management. A significant portion of Federated Hermes' revenue is derived from investment advisory fees, which are typically based on the value of managed assets and vary with the type of asset being managed, with higher fees generally earned on equity and multi-asset products and strategies than on fixed-income, alternative/private markets and money market products and strategies. Federated Hermes also can earn performance fees or carried interest on certain products and types of assets. Mutual fund and other fund products generally have higher advisory fees than Separate Accounts. Additionally, certain components of distribution expense can vary depending upon the asset class, distribution channel and/or the size or structure of the customer relationship. Consequently, significant fluctuations in the value of securities held by, or the level of redemptions from, the products (such as the Federated Hermes Funds) or strategies advised by Federated Hermes, and overall asset mix among products and strategies, can materially affect the amount of managed assets and thus Federated Hermes' revenue, profitability and growth. Similarly, changes in Federated Hermes' average asset mix across both asset and product or strategy types have a direct impact on Federated Hermes' revenue and profitability. Federated Hermes generally pays out a larger portion of the revenue earned from managed assets in money market and multi-asset funds than the revenue earned from managed assets in equity, fixed-income and alternative/private markets funds. A significant portion of Federated Hermes' managed assets is in investment products or strategies that permit investors to redeem or withdraw their investment at any time. Capacity constraints, where the size of AUM in a particular product, strategy or asset class make it more difficult to trade efficiently in the market, can result in certain products, strategies, or asset classes being partially or fully closed to new investment, which can result in redemptions or a reallocation of assets to other products, strategies or asset classes. Additionally, changing market conditions can cause a shift in Federated Hermes' asset mix towards money market and fixed-income products or strategies, and regulatory changes or developments can cause a shift between money market fund products or from money market funds to other products. Each of the above factors can cause a decline in or otherwise affect, potentially in a material way, Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nImpairment Risk. At December 31, 2020, Federated Hermes had intangible assets including goodwill totaling $1.3 billion on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, the vast majority of which represents assets capitalized in connection with Federated Hermes' acquisitions and business combinations (such as the HFML Acquisition and HCL Acquisition). Federated Hermes might not realize the value of these assets. Management performs an annual review of the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and periodic reviews of the carrying values of all other assets to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that an impairment in value has occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of an asset to become impaired. For example, the value of an asset could be impacted if, among other factors, projected future revenue streams are reduced due to lower managed assets or revenue is subject to clawback provisions. Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the asset would occur, resulting in a noncash charge which would adversely affect Federated Hermes' financial position and results of operations for the period.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Termination or Failure to Renew Advisory Agreements. A substantial majority of Federated Hermes' revenues are derived from investment advisory agreements with Federated Hermes Funds (and to a lesser extent, sub-advised mutual funds) registered under the 1940 Act that, as required by law, are terminable upon 60 days' notice. In addition, each such investment advisory agreement must be approved and renewed annually by each mutual fund's board of directors or trustees, including independent members of the board, or its shareholders, as required by law. Failure to renew, changes resulting in lower fees under, or termination of, certain or a significant number of, these agreements could have a material adverse impact on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. As required by the 1940 Act, each investment advisory agreement with a mutual fund automatically terminates upon its assignment, although new investment advisory agreements can be approved by the mutual fund's directors or trustees and shareholders. A sale or other transfer of a sufficient number of shares of Federated Hermes' voting securities to transfer control of Federated Hermes could be deemed an assignment in certain circumstances. An assignment, actual or constructive, will trigger these termination provisions and can adversely affect Federated Hermes' ability to realize the value of these agreements. Federated Hermes' investment advisory agreements for Separate Accounts that are not investment companies subject to the 1940 Act are generally terminable upon notice to Federated Hermes (or, in certain cases, after a 30 day, 60 day or similar notice period). As required by the Advisers Act, investment advisory agreements for Separate Accounts that are not investment companies subject to the\n1940 Act also provide that consent is required from Federated Hermes' customers before the agreements can be assigned and an assignment, actual or constructive, also will trigger these consent requirements and can adversely affect Federated Hermes' ability to realize the value of these agreements. Regarding the investment advisory agreements with non-U.S. registered Federated Hermes Funds, shareholder notice or consent can be required if, after an investment advisory agreement is entered into, there are changes to fees, and such investment advisory agreements are generally terminable for any reason, without cause, after a 30-day to 90-day notice period. Customer consent to amend investment advisory agreements for non-U.S. Separate Accounts can be required for amendments to such agreements, and such agreements also are generally terminable for any reason, without cause, after a 30-day to 90-day notice period.\nUnder the terms of a 2005 settlement agreement with the SEC and New York State Attorney General, as amended, a Federated Hermes investment advisory subsidiary cannot serve as investment advisor to any registered investment company unless: (1) at least 75% of the fund's directors are independent of Federated Hermes; (2) the chairman of each such fund is independent of Federated Hermes; and (3) no action can be taken by the fund's board of directors or trustees or any committee thereof unless approved by a majority of the independent board members of the fund or committee, respectively.\nRisks Related to Interest Rates and Investment Performance\nPotential Adverse Effects of Low Short-Term Interest Rates. In March 2020, in response to disrupted economic activity as a result of Covid-19, the FOMC decreased the federal funds target rate range to 0% - 0.25%. The federal funds target rate drives short-term interest rates. The FOMC indicated that the federal funds rate would likely stay at near zero at least through 2022 as the economy recovers from Covid-19. As a result of the near-zero interest-rate environment, the gross yield earned by certain money market funds is not sufficient to cover all of the fund's operating expenses. Beginning in the first quarter 2020, Federated Hermes began to waive fees in order for certain money market funds to maintain positive or zero net yields (Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers). These waivers have been partially offset by related reductions in distribution expense as a result of Federated Hermes' mutual understanding and agreement with third-party intermediaries to share the impact of the Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. See Item 1A - Risk Factors under the caption Specific Risk Factors - Risks Related to Federated Hermes' Investment Management Business - Potential Adverse Effects of Increased Competition in the Investment Management Business for information on competitive waivers currently being implemented by Federated Hermes, other than the Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers.\nThese Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers are calculated as a percentage of AUM in certain money market funds and thus can vary depending upon the asset levels and mix in such funds. While the level of fee waivers are impacted by various factors, as an isolated variable, increases in short-term interest rates that result in higher yields on securities purchased in money market fund portfolios would likely reduce the negative pre-tax impact of these waivers. Also, as an isolated variable, a further decrease in short-term interest rates that results in lower or negative yields on securities purchased in money market funds generally would increase these fee waivers for certain money market funds and the negative pre-tax impact of these waivers. In that case, Federated Hermes could be required to implement structural changes to certain money market funds (such as, for example, utilizing reverse distribution mechanisms or share cancellation methodologies) and incur additional expenses associated with implementing such changes. Moreover, at this time, interest rates are not expected to increase through 2022 and any corresponding increases in yields and resulting decreases in fee waivers would be uncertain and not directly proportional. In addition, the level and actual amount of fee waivers, and the resulting negative impact of these fee waivers, are contingent on a number of variables, including, but not limited to, changes in assets within the money market funds, changes in yields available for purchase by the money market funds, changes due to the level of government measures to further stimulate the economy which could result in the issuance of additional Treasury debt instruments, actions by the FOMC, the U.S. Department of Treasury, the SEC, FSOC and other governmental entities, changes in expenses of the money market funds, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in customer relationships, changes in money market product structures and offerings, demand for competing products, changes in the distribution fee arrangements with third parties, Federated Hermes' willingness to continue the Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by third parties. In any given period, a combination of these variables impacts the amount of Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. Given the variables involved, the actual amount of future fee waivers, if any, and the resulting negative impact of any waivers could vary significantly from period to period.\nWith regard to asset mix, changes in the relative amount of money market fund assets in prime and government money market funds (or between such funds and other money market funds or other products), as well as the mix among certain share classes that vary in pricing structure, can impact the level of fee waivers. Generally, prime money market funds will waive less than government money market funds as a result of higher gross yields on their underlying investments. As such, as an isolated variable, an increase in the relative proportion of average managed assets invested in prime money market funds as compared to\ntotal average money market fund assets should typically result in lower Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. The opposite would also be true.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers totaled $113.0 million. These fee waivers were partially offset by related reductions in distribution expenses of $98.4 million, such that the net negative pre-tax impact to Federated Hermes was $14.6 million. See Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information on management's expectations regarding fee waivers in the first quarter 2021. The duration, level and impact of a further decline in interest rates and/or future Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Rising Interest Rates. Increases in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on Federated Hermes' revenue from money market, fixed-income, alternative/private markets and other products and strategies. The value of equity securities (such as dividend-paying equity securities) also can rise and fall in response to changes in interest rates. In a rising short-term interest rate environment, certain investors using money market products and strategies or other short-duration fixed income products and strategies for cash management purposes can shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other products or strategies holding lower-yielding instruments. In addition, rising interest rates will tend to reduce the fair value of securities held in various investment products and strategies. Rising interest rates also can impact demand for and cost to finance real estate and impact the value of and returns on real estate and other alternative products and strategies. Among other potential adverse effects, rising interest rates can result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the markets and could negatively impact the performance of Federated Hermes' products and strategies and Federated Hermes' revenue. Management cannot estimate the impact of rising interest rates (including, for example on Federated Hermes' revenue), but such impact could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Poor Investment Performance. Success in the investment management business is largely dependent on investment performance relative to market conditions and the performance of competing products and strategies. Good performance generally assists retention and growth of managed assets, resulting in additional revenues. Good performance can also result in performance fees or carried interest being earned on certain products. Conversely, poor performance, or the failure to meet product or strategy investment objectives and policies, tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions, and failure to earn performance fees, carried interest and/or other fees. There can be no guarantee that any product or strategy will be successful and have good performance. A product or strategy being, or becoming, an unsuitable product or strategy for a customer, whether due to changes in customer investment objectives or otherwise, also tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions, and failure to earn performance fees, carried interest and/or other fees. For certain products or strategies, failure to integrate and apply acceptable ESG standards, or sustainability or responsible investment principles, can be considered in determining, or result in, poor performance, and result in decreased sales and increased redemptions, and failure to earn performance fees, carried interest and/or other fees. The failure to earn performance fees, carried interest and/or other fees results in a corresponding decrease in revenues to Federated Hermes. Poor performance could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Market conditions, such as volatility, illiquidity and rising or falling interest rates, among other conditions, can adversely affect the performance of certain quantitative or other investment strategies or certain products, asset classes or sectors. Limitations imposed by certain trade agreements, and government-imposed restrictions, such as those on investments in certain countries or companies, can limit investment opportunities and negatively affect performance. Performance also can be adversely affected by inferior security selection, human error, government or issuer financial constraints, and other factors. The effects of poor performance on Federated Hermes could be magnified where assets or customers are concentrated in certain strategies, products, asset classes or sectors. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and poor performance of investments made by Federated Hermes, or derivatives (including, for example, hedges or forward contracts) or other financial transactions entered into by Federated Hermes, can result in investment or capital losses and also can materially adversely affect Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Federated Hermes' Corporate Structure\nStatus as a Controlled Company. Federated Hermes has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock, which has voting power, and Class B Common Stock, which is non-voting except in certain limited circumstances. All of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock are held by the Voting Shares Irrevocable Trust for the benefit of certain members of the Donahue family. The three trustees of this trust are Federated Hermes' President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, J. Christopher Donahue, his brother, Thomas R. Donahue, Federated Hermes' Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and a director, and their mother, Rhodora J. Donahue. Accordingly, Federated Hermes qualifies as a\n\"controlled company\" under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Listed Company Manual. As a controlled company, Federated Hermes qualifies for and relies upon exemptions from several NYSE corporate governance requirements, including requirements that: (1) a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors; and (2) the entity maintains a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities. As a result, Federated Hermes' board does not have a majority of independent directors nor does it maintain a nominating/corporate governance committee. Federated Hermes is also exempt as a \"controlled company\" from certain additional independence requirements and responsibilities regarding compensation advisors applicable to Compensation Committee members. While Federated Hermes believes its dual-class structure is appropriate and benefits its shareholders, and should be a factor taken into account by shareholders when investing in Federated Hermes, as a company with a dual-class structure, Federated Hermes can be excluded from certain financial indexes, which could result in decreased investments in its Class B Common Stock and adversely affect its stock price.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEconomic and Market Risks\nPotential Adverse Effects of a Decline or Disruption in the Economy or Markets. Economic or market downturns, disruptions or other conditions (domestic or international) can cause volatility, illiquidity and other potential adverse effects in the markets. Such conditions also can adversely affect, potentially in a material way, the supply of investments, such as money market or municipal (tax-exempt) securities and the profitability and performance of, demand for and investor confidence in investment products, strategies and services, including those of Federated Hermes. Such economic or market downturns, disruptions or other conditions can include, for example, disruptions in the markets, defaults or poor performance in certain sectors of the economy, unemployment, excessive corporate debt levels, increased personal, business or government/municipality bankruptcies, supply chain disruptions, the commencement, continuation or ending of government policies and reforms (including those of new administrations or otherwise), stimulus programs, and other market-related actions, quantitative easing or tightening or other changes in monetary policy, central bank activism through continued, increased or decreased ownership, exchange, cancellation or issuance of debt or other means, increased regulation or a slower pace for new regulation or deregulation, increases or decreases in interest rates, changes in oil prices or other changes in commodity markets or prices, changes in currency values, changes in property values and financial costs, or exchange rates or currency abandonment, inflation or deflation, index changes, widening bid/ask spreads, changes in the allocation of capital to market-making, restructuring of government-sponsored entities, imposition of economic sanctions or government-imposed investment restrictions, trade friction or trade wars and increased trade tariffs, economic or political weakness, political turmoil or unrest, geopolitical tensions or military escalation or other instability in certain countries or regions, technology-related or cyber attacks or incidents, terrorism, the prospects for or concerns about any of the foregoing factors or events, or other factors or events that affect the markets. For example, regarding currency abandonment and political instability, there remains uncertainty regarding the fallout from the UK departure from the EU after Brexit. This uncertainty can affect other countries in the EU and elsewhere. The UK's departure from the EU also can cause volatility within the EU, triggering prolonged economic downturns in certain European countries or sparking additional Member States to depart, or contemplate departing, from the EU. In addition, Brexit creates the possibility of additional economic stresses for the UK, including potential decreased trade, difficulty in, or increased expenses relating to, marketing and selling UK funds and other financial products in the EU and EU funds and other financial products in the UK, capital outflows, devaluation of the British pound sterling, wider corporate bond spreads due to uncertainty, worker dislocation or restrictions, and declines in business and consumer spending as well as foreign direct investment. See Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters - Current Regulatory Environment - International for additional information on Brexit. Each of the above factors, among others, can cause or contribute to economic or market downturns, disruptions or other conditions and their potentially adverse effects. In addition, Federated Hermes' products and strategies can be adversely affected, potentially in a material way, by changes in U.S., UK, EU or other markets, downgrades of U.S., UK or other countries' credit ratings, the U.S. debt ceiling or other developments in the U.S., UK and other countries as well as by actual or potential deterioration in international sovereign or other market conditions.\nAt December 31, 2020, Federated Hermes' liquid assets of $432.5 million included investments in certain money market and fluctuating net asset value (NAV) Federated Hermes Funds that can have direct and/or indirect exposures to international sovereign debt and currency risks. Federated Hermes and the money market and other fluctuating NAV Federated Hermes Funds managed or distributed by Federated Hermes also interact with various other financial industry participants, such as counterparties, broker/dealers, banks, clearing organizations, other investment products and customers, as a result of operations, trading, distribution and other relationships. As a result, Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be adversely affected by the creditworthiness or financial soundness of other financial industry participants, particularly in times of economic or financial stress or disruption. There can be no assurance that any potential losses that are realized as a result of these exposures will not have a material\nadverse effect on Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe ability of Federated Hermes to compete and sustain asset and revenue growth is dependent, in part, on the relative attractiveness of the types of investment products and strategies Federated Hermes offers and its investment performance under prevailing market conditions. Adverse market conditions or other events also could impact Federated Hermes' customers. In the event of extreme circumstances, such as economic, political, or business crises, Federated Hermes' products and strategies can suffer significant net redemptions in AUM causing severe liquidity issues in its short-term, fixed-income or certain other sponsored investment products and strategies and declines in the value of and returns on AUM, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nCustody, depository and portfolio accounting services for the Federated Hermes Funds generally are outsourced to third-party financial institutions that are leading providers of such fund services. Accounting records for the Federated Hermes Funds are maintained by these service providers. These service providers, or other service providers of Federated Hermes and its products or customers, could also be adversely affected by the adverse market conditions described above. It is not possible to predict the extent to which the services or products Federated Hermes receives from such service providers would be interrupted or affected by such situations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a potential service interruption or Federated Hermes' ability to find a suitable replacement would not have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nNo Assurance of Access to Sufficient Liquidity. From time to time, like other companies, Federated Hermes' operations can require more cash than is available from operations. In these circumstances, it can be necessary to borrow from lending facilities or to raise capital by securing new debt or by selling shares of Federated Hermes equity or debt securities. Federated Hermes' ability to raise additional capital in the future will be affected by several factors including, for example, Federated Hermes' creditworthiness and the market value of Federated Hermes' common stock, as well as general market conditions. There can be no assurance that Federated Hermes will be able to obtain these funds and financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if Federated Hermes cannot obtain such funds, it could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. If a Federated Hermes Fund requires liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions or for other reasons, there also can be no assurance that such Federated Hermes Fund will be able to access any available line of credit, rely on inter-fund lending arrangements or access other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms, if any at all, and, if such a Federated Hermes Fund cannot obtain sufficient liquidity, it could have a material adverse effect on such Federated Hermes Fund, result in redemptions and a corresponding reduction in Federated Hermes' AUM and Federated Hermes' revenue. While not obligated, if Federated Hermes decides to provide credit support to a Federated Hermes Fund, Federated Hermes liquidity and income could be adversely impacted. These factors could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nPotential Adverse Effects of Changes in Laws, Regulations and Other Rules. Like other companies, Federated Hermes and its investment management business are (and any new business line commenced or acquired by Federated Hermes would be) subject to extensive regulation both within and outside the U.S. Federated Hermes and its products, such as the Federated Hermes Funds, and strategies are subject to: federal securities laws, principally the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act; state laws regarding securities fraud and registration; and regulations or other rules, promulgated by various regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations or exchanges, both domestically and abroad, including, but not limited to, the SEC, FINRA, FCA, CBI and NYSE. From time to time, the federal securities laws have been or can be augmented or amended substantially. For example, among other measures, Federated Hermes and its products and strategies have been impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Patriot Act of 2001 and the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999.\nFederated Hermes and its domestic products (such as the Federated Hermes Funds) and strategies, and any non-U.S. products (such as non-U.S. Federated Hermes Funds) and strategies to the extent offered in the U.S., continue to be primarily regulated by the SEC. Federated Hermes, and certain Federated Hermes Funds, are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) due to their investment in futures, swaps or certain other commodity interests in more than de minimis amounts. In addition, during the past several years, regulators, self-regulatory organizations or exchanges, such as the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, NFA, NYSE and state or local governments and regulators, have adopted, and could adopt, other regulations, rules and amendments that have increased Federated Hermes' operating expenses and affected the conduct of its business, as well as Federated Hermes' AUM, revenues and operating\nincome, and could continue to do so. Federated Hermes' business is affected by laws, regulations, and regulatory authorities that impact the manner in which Federated Hermes' products are structured, distributed, provided or sold. Federated Hermes and its products and strategies also are affected by certain other laws and regulations governing banks, other financial institutions, intermediaries or real estate. The second half of 2020 saw an uptick in regulations issued by the SEC and other regulators, and the market turmoil in March and April 2020 as a result of Covid-19 has brought a renewed focus on additional money market fund reforms. See Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters - Current Regulatory Environment - Domestic for additional information on laws and regulations applicable to Federated Hermes' business.\nFederated Hermes' and its products' activities outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign laws and regulation, which are promulgated or amended from time to time, by foreign regulatory or other authorities, such as the FCA for London-based operations, the CBI for Dublin-based operations, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority for Frankfurt-based operations, the Cayman Island Monetary Authority for Cayman Island products, and the Ontario (and certain other provincial) Securities Commission for Canadian products. For example, Federated Hermes' stewardship services can be impacted by proxy advisor regulations, including the Proxy Advisors (Shareholders' Rights) Regulations 2019 passed by the UK Parliament. In addition to existing and potential future regulation, a financial transaction tax, particularly if enacted with broad application in the UK or EU, or even the U.S., would be detrimental to Federated Hermes' business. Regulatory reforms stemming from Brexit, as well as the potential political and economic uncertainty surrounding a post-Brexit UK and EU, or other initiatives also can increase volatility in the UK and EU and could be detrimental to Federated Hermes' business. Additionally, the HFML Acquisition, HCL Acquisition and MEPC Acquisition each increase the potential Brexit impact to Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. See Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters - Current Regulatory Environment - International for additional information on laws and regulations applicable to Federated Hermes' non-U.S. business.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provided for a systemic risk regulation regime under which it is possible that Federated Hermes, and/or any one or more of its products (such as the Federated Hermes Funds), could be subject to designation as a systemically important financial institution by the FSOC. Similarly, it is possible that the FSB could designate Federated Hermes, and/or one of its products (such as the non-U.S. Federated Hermes Funds), as a non-bank, non-insurance company global systemically important financial institution. Among other potential impacts, any such designation would result in Federated Hermes and/or its products being subject to additional banking regulation and bank-oriented measures, including, for example, capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limitations, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, as well as oversight by the Governors or FSB, in addition to being subject to primary regulation by securities regulators such as the SEC, FCA and CBI.\nAs Federated Hermes' business grows (whether organically or through acquisition or whether through new products, strategies or services being offered, growth of existing products, strategies and services, expansion into new jurisdictions, or otherwise), Federated Hermes' products, strategies and operations need to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, interpretations and government policies, which increases compliance risk and operating expenses, including the costs associated with compliance. Compliance risk and operating expenses also can increase as Federated Hermes continues to expand its use of ESG, sustainability, stewardship or other data inputs or investment techniques in providing its investment products, strategies and services, enters new countries or markets, and/or financial products and other investments, as well as when markets and technology increase in complexity. Regulators, such as the SEC, FCA and CBI, also have undertaken or could undertake examinations, investigations, and/or enforcement actions involving investment management industry participants, such as Federated Hermes and its products. Federated Hermes expends internal and external resources to respond to examinations and investigations, and defend enforcement actions, which increases operating expenses, including professional fees and costs associated with compliance. Management continues to monitor and evaluate the impact of the Regulatory Developments discussed above (and in Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters) on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. These Regulatory Developments include, among others, stress testing requirements, fund of funds rules, Regulation Best Interest, a new SEC derivatives rule, a new advertising rule, Brexit-related regulation, a potential FTT, the transition from LIBOR, changes in the UK regulatory capital regime, new UK and EU regulatory requirements (such as SFDR), liquidity rules, and existing and potential new U.S., UK and EU money market fund regulation. Among other potential impacts, these Regulatory Developments have increased, and could continue to increase, in addition to compliance risks and compliance costs, the costs associated with technology, legal, operations and other efforts to address regulatory-related matters. These regulatory requirements and developments also have caused, and could continue to cause, (1) certain product line-up, structure, pricing and product development changes, (2) changes in the ability to utilize \"soft dollars\" to pay for certain research and brokerage services (rather than Federated Hermes paying for such services directly), (3) money market, equity, fixed-income, alternative/private markets and multi-asset products to become less attractive to institutional and other investors, (4) reductions in the number of Federated Hermes Funds offered by intermediaries,\n(5) changes in the fees Federated Hermes, retirement plan advisors and intermediaries will be able to earn on investment products and services sold to retirement plan clients, (6) changes in asset flows, levels and mix and customer relationships and (7) reductions in AUM, revenues and operating profits. As examples, HFML established offices in Ireland, Germany and Denmark as a result of Brexit to mitigate potential concerns regarding it becoming more difficult to passport products between the UK and EU Member States. In addition, certain money market funds or other products or strategies can become less attractive to institutional or other investors, which could result in changes in asset mix and reductions in AUM, revenues and operating income. The renewed focus on additional money market fund regulation increases this risk.\nOn a cumulative basis, Federated Hermes' regulatory, product development and restructuring, and other efforts in response to the Regulatory Developments discussed above, including the internal and external resources dedicated to such efforts, have had, and could continue to have, a material impact on Federated Hermes' expenses and, in turn, financial performance. The floating NAV for institutional and municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds, and redemption fees and liquidity gates, required by the 2014 Money Fund Rules and Guidance, effective October 14, 2016, resulted in a shift in asset mix from institutional prime and municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds to stable NAV government money market funds across the investment management industry and at Federated Hermes, which impacted its AUM, revenues and operating income. While asset mix shifted back in recent years toward institutional prime and municipal (tax-exempt) money market funds, the market disruptions in March and April 2020 stinted that shift, and there is no guarantee such shift will result in asset mix between institutional prime, municipal (or tax-exempt) and government money market funds returning to pre-October 2016 levels. Any additional money market fund reforms could result in a further shift away from institutional prime and municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds.\nThe regulatory changes and developments in the current regulatory environment, and Federated Hermes' efforts in responding to them, could have a material and adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. While the FSOC's change in focus and continuing transparency efforts have to date reduced the possibility of any Federated Hermes products being designated a systemically important non-bank financial company, management also believes that the designation of Federated Hermes and/or one or more products as a systemically important non-bank financial company or a non-bank, non-insurance company global systemically important financial institution by the FSB, and/or the issuance of final regulations or reforms relating to such designations, would be detrimental to Federated Hermes' money market fund business and could materially and adversely affect Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Given the current regulatory environment, Federated Hermes is unable to fully assess the degree of the impact of adopted or proposed regulations and other Regulatory Developments, and Federated Hermes' efforts related thereto, on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nChanges in laws, regulations, rules, interpretations or governmental policies, domestically and abroad, also impact the financial intermediaries, service providers, customers and other third parties with whom Federated Hermes, and its products (such as the Federated Hermes Funds), conduct business. For example, the DOL issued a new fiduciary rule and ESG rule in the fourth quarter 2020. Additionally, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act or Regulation Best Interest, can affect intermediaries' sale or use of Federated Hermes' products or strategies. Among other potential impacts, these changes are affecting, and could continue to affect, Federated Hermes' arrangements with these intermediaries, and could continue to increase fee pressure, reduce the number of Federated Hermes products and strategies offered by intermediaries, cause certain clients or intermediaries to favor passive products over actively managed products, increase respective operating expenses and distribution costs, result in lower AUM, change asset flows, levels and mix, and otherwise affect the conduct of Federated Hermes' or such intermediaries' respective businesses. This resulted, and will likely continue to result, in Federated Hermes or one or more of these third parties seeking to restructure or alter their compensation or other terms of the business arrangements between Federated Hermes or its products (including the Federated Hermes Funds) and one or more of these third parties. The above factors could have a material adverse impact on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nFor a further discussion of U.S. and international Regulatory Developments that can impact Federated Hermes and its business, products, strategies and services, see Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters.\nFinally, Federated Hermes' business also has been, and will continue to be (unless reversed by the new administration and Congress), impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act), signed into law on December 22, 2017. See Note (16) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. With the change in administration in the U.S., Federated Hermes is unable to predict whether it will continue to enjoy the benefits of the Tax Act or whether the corporate tax rate reduction implemented by the Tax Act will be reversed, subjecting Federated Hermes to greater corporate income tax. Moreover, as a result of the impact of Covid-19, the corporate tax rate in the UK, which was expected to be reduced to 17% in 2020, remained at 19%, depriving Federated Hermes of the benefit of the decreased UK corporate tax rate. In addition, various service industries, including, for example, mutual fund service providers, have been, and continue to be, the subject of changes\nin tax policy that impact their state and local tax liability. Changes that have been adopted or proposed include (1) an expansion of the nature of a service company's activities that subject it to tax in a jurisdiction, (2) a change in the methodology by which multi-state companies apportion their income between jurisdictions, and (3) a requirement that affiliated companies calculate their state tax as one combined entity. As adopted changes become effective and additional jurisdictions enact similar changes, among other potential impacts, there could be a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' tax liability and effective tax rate and, as a result, net income. Various investment products also can be impacted by tax changes, which could have an adverse effect on the products and Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Litigation, Investigations, Proceedings and Other Claims. Like other companies, Federated Hermes and the Federated Hermes Funds can be subject to regulatory examinations, inquiries, investigations, litigation and other claims and proceedings. Regarding examinations, Federated Hermes is subject to routine, sweep and other examinations, inquiries, investigations, proceedings (administrative, regulatory, civil or otherwise) and other claims by its regulators (regulatory claims). Federated Hermes and the Federated Hermes Funds also can be subject to employee, former employee, customer, and other third-party, complaints, proceedings (such as civil litigation) and other claims (business-related claims). Among other factors, as Federated Hermes' business grows (whether organically or through acquisition or whether through new products, strategies or services being offered or through growth of existing products, strategies and services, or otherwise), the attention and resources devoted to compliance, and the possibility of noncompliance, also can increase. The attention and resources devoted to compliance, and the possibility of noncompliance, also can increase as Federated Hermes expands its use of ESG, sustainability, stewardship or other data inputs or investment techniques in providing its investment products, strategies and services, enters new countries or markets, and financial products and other investments, as well as when markets and technology increase in complexity. Federated Hermes has business-related claims asserted and threatened against it, and Federated Hermes and the Federated Hermes Funds are subject to certain regulatory claims (such as routine and sweep examinations and other inquiries), in the ordinary course of business. In addition, Federated Hermes and the Federated Hermes Funds can be subject to business-related claims, claims related to Federated Hermes sponsorship or management of, or inclusion of proprietary Federated Hermes Funds in, its 401(k) plan or other benefit plans, and administrative, regulatory or civil investigations and proceedings or other regulatory claims, outside of the ordinary course of business. Federated Hermes cannot assess or predict whether, when or what types of business-related claims, fiduciary claims or regulatory claims (collectively, claims) could be threatened or asserted, the types or amounts of damages or other remedies that could be sought (which can be material when threatened or asserted), whether claims that have been threatened will become formal asserted pending investigations, proceedings or litigation, or whether claims ultimately will be successful (whether through settlement or adjudication), entirely or in part, whether or not any such claims are threatened or asserted in or outside the ordinary course of business. Federated Hermes can be initially unable to accurately assess a claim's impact. Given that the outcome of any claim is inherently unpredictable and uncertain, a result can arise from time to time that adversely impacts, potentially in a material way, Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. In certain circumstances, insurance coverage might not be available or deductible amounts might not be exceeded, and Federated Hermes, the Federated Hermes Funds or Separate Accounts managed by Federated Hermes could have to bear the costs related to claims or any losses or other liabilities resulting from any such matters, or from the operation of Federated Hermes' business, products and services.\nRisks Related to Auditor Independence. Public companies, such as Federated Hermes, utilize the audit services of a registered public accounting firm (Accounting Firm) to audit or review their financial statements included in certain public filings, such as their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Accounting Firm is required to make a determination that such firm satisfies certain independence requirements under applicable securities laws. For example, Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (Loan Rule) prohibits Accounting Firms, or covered person professionals within the firms, from having certain financial relationships with their audit clients and affiliated entities. Rule 2-01(c)(1)(i)(A) of Regulation S-X (Investment Rule) also prohibits the Accounting Firm, or covered person professionals and their immediate family members, from having certain direct investments in audit clients and affiliated entities. Due to acquisitions that result in inadvertent investments in the audit client or funds or other products that it or its affiliates manage, or other circumstances, an Accounting Firm can violate the Investment Rule and be required to timely and appropriately remedy such violation such that the audit client can make a determination that it continues to believe that the Accounting Firm has the ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the Accounting Firm's audit and review services.\nLike other public companies, there is a risk that activities or relationships of the Accounting Firm engaged by Federated Hermes, or such firm's partners or employees, can prevent a determination from being made that such firm satisfies such independence requirements with respect to Federated Hermes, which could render such firm ineligible to serve as Federated Hermes' independent Accounting Firm. HFML also utilized the Accounting Firm engaged by Federated Hermes. Certain Federated Hermes Funds managed by HFML also utilize other Accounting Firms.\nSince Federated Hermes' independent Accounting Firm, like the Accounting Firms of many other public companies that sponsor and advise investment funds, acts in a similar capacity to several Federated Hermes Funds sponsored and advised by Federated Hermes, if a determination cannot be made that the Accounting Firm satisfies the independence requirements with respect to an applicable Federated Hermes Fund, the Accounting Firm also could be prevented from making a determination that it satisfies the independence requirements with respect to Federated Hermes, since Federated Hermes is an affiliate (i.e., the ultimate parent company) of the investment advisor to the relevant Federated Hermes Fund.\nThere can be no assurance that the circumstances in any particular case will satisfy applicable independence requirements under the applicable securities laws such that an Accounting Firm will remain eligible to serve as the independent Accounting Firm to Federated Hermes, HFML or any Federated Hermes Fund. If it were to be determined that the independence requirements under applicable securities laws were not complied with regarding Federated Hermes, its previously filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K (including financial statements audited by its existing Accounting Firm) and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including financial statements reviewed by its existing Accounting Firm) might not be considered compliant with the applicable securities laws. If it were to be determined that an Accounting Firm did not comply with the independence requirements, among other things, the financial statements audited by the Accounting Firm and the interim financial statements reviewed by the Accounting Firm could have to be audited and reviewed, respectively, by another independent Accounting Firm, Federated Hermes' eligibility to issue securities under its existing registration statements can be impacted and certain financial reporting and/or other covenants with, and representations and warranties to, Federated Hermes' lenders can be impacted. Similar issues would arise for a Federated Hermes Fund for which Federated Hermes' Accounting Firm (or another Accounting Firm) serves as such Federated Hermes Fund's independent Accounting Firm if it were to be determined that Federated Hermes' Accounting Firm (or such other Accounting Firm) was not in compliance with the independence requirements under applicable securities laws, with respect to such Federated Hermes Fund. In either case, such events could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nOperations-Related Risks\nOperational Risks. Like other companies, Federated Hermes' products, business and operations are supported internally and through management of relationships, including, for example, outsourcing relationships, with various third-party service providers, both domestically and internationally. In turn, service providers' operations rely on additional relationships with other third parties. Operational risks include, but are not limited to, improper, inefficient, or unauthorized execution, processing, pricing and/or monitoring of transactions, inadequate, inefficient, inflexible, deficient or non-scalable technology, operating systems or other infrastructure, poor performance by internal resources or third party service providers, failure to appropriately supervise internal resources or perform due diligence on and supervise third party service providers (particularly in light of Covid-19, which has required remote due diligence to be conducted), business disruptions, failure to effectively upgrade technology or transition to a \"cloud-based\" environment, inadequacies or breaches in Federated Hermes', its products' or a service provider's internal control processes, unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of, or access to, confidential, proprietary or non-public personal or business information and noncompliance with regulatory requirements, investment mandates and related investment parameters, or customer-imposed restrictions. As Federated Hermes' and its relevant service providers' businesses expand and require additional scalability, operational risk increases. There is a risk that changes (including upgrades or patches) in operational systems and business processes are not completed correctly, in a controlled manner, in a timely manner or in a manner that achieves intended results. Management relies on its employees, systems and business continuity plans, and those of relevant service providers, to comply with established procedures, controls, regulatory requirements, investment parameters or customer-imposed restrictions. Breakdown or improper use of systems, human error or improper action by employees or service providers, or noncompliance with regulations or other rules, investment parameters or customer-imposed restrictions, could cause material adverse effects on Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nSystems, Technology and Cybersecurity Risks. Like other companies, Federated Hermes utilizes software and related technologies throughout its business (both domestically and internationally) including, for example, both proprietary systems and those provided by outside service providers. Service providers to, and customers of, Federated Hermes and its products, and third parties on which such service providers and customers rely, also utilize software and related technologies in their businesses. Federated Hermes continues to increase its investment in systems and technology, including externally hosted systems and technology, for investment management and trading operations, information and data management, disaster recovery, compliance and other areas of its business, and is exploring innovative technological solutions and products involving artificial intelligence and financial technology. Unanticipated issues could occur with any software, system or other technology and it is not possible to predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from a failure of Federated Hermes or a third party to address technology or computer system problems. Along with cyber incidents described more fully below, data or model imprecision, software or other technology malfunctions, human error, programming inaccuracies and similar or other\ncircumstances or events can impair the performance of systems and technology. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that potential system interruptions, other technology-related issues or the cost necessary to rectify the problems would not have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, its reputation and business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, like other companies, Federated Hermes' business relies on the security and reliability of information and communications technology, systems and networks. Federated Hermes uses digital technology, including, for example, networked systems, email and the Internet, to conduct business operations and engage clients, customers, employees, products, accounts, shareholders and relevant service providers, among others. The use of the Internet and other electronic media, computers and technology exposes Federated Hermes, its business, its products and strategies and services, customers, and relevant service providers, and their respective operations, to potential risks from frequent cybersecurity attacks, events or incidents (cyber incidents). For example, Federated Hermes and relevant service providers collect, maintain and transmit confidential, proprietary and non-public personal customer, business and employee information (such as in connection with online account access and performing investment, reconciliation, transfer agent, custodian and other recordkeeping and related functions) that can be targeted by cyber incidents. The work-from-home environment necessitated by Covid-19 has increased the risk of cyber incidents given the increase in cyber attack surface stemming from the use of personal devices and non-office or personal technology. Federated Hermes, as well as its products and certain service providers, also generate, compile and process information for purposes of preparing and making filings or reports to governmental agencies or providing reports or statements to customers, and a cyber incident that impacts that information, or the generation and filing processes, can prevent required regulatory filings and reports from being made or reports or statements from being delivered. Cyber incidents involving Federated Hermes or its products or service providers, regulators or exchanges to which confidential, personally identifiable or other information is reported or filed also can result in unauthorized disclosure or compromise of, or access to, such information.\nCyber incidents can result from intentional (or deliberate) attacks or unintentional events by insiders (e.g., employees) or third parties, including cybercriminals, competitors, nation-states and \"hacktivists,\" among others. Cyber incidents can include, for example, phishing, credential harvesting or use of stolen access credentials, unauthorized access to systems, networks or devices (for example, through hacking activity), structured query language attacks, infection from or spread of malware, ransomware, computer viruses or other malicious software code, corruption of data, exfiltration of data to malicious sites, the dark web or other locations or threat actors, and attacks (including, but not limited to, denial-of-service attacks on websites), which shut down, disable, slow, impair or otherwise disrupt operations, business processes, technology, connectivity or website or internet access, functionality or performance. In addition to intentional cyber incidents, unintentional cyber incidents can occur (for example, the inadvertent release of confidential or non-public personal information).\nLike other companies, Federated Hermes has experienced, and will continue to experience, cyber incidents on a daily basis. As of December 31, 2020, cyber incidents have not had a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Cyber incidents can affect, potentially in a material way, Federated Hermes' relationships with its customers, employees, products, accounts, shareholders and relevant service providers. A cyber incident can cause Federated Hermes, its business, products or services, employees, customers, or relevant service providers, to lose proprietary, sensitive, confidential or non-public business, customer, employee or personal information, or intellectual property, suffer data corruption or business interruption, lose operational capacity (for example, the loss of the ability to process transactions, generate or make filings or deliver reports or statements, calculate NAVs, or allow the transaction of business, or other disruptions to operations), and/or fail to comply with applicable privacy and other laws. Among other potentially harmful effects, cyber incidents also can result in theft, unauthorized monitoring and failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems. Any cyber incident could cause lost revenues, the occurrence of other financial losses, diminished future cash flows, significant increases in compliance or other costs or expenses (such as costs associated with compliance with cybersecurity laws and regulations, protection, detection, remediation and corrective measures, and credit monitoring for impacted individuals), exposure to increased litigation and legal risks (such as regulatory actions and penalties, and breach of contract or other litigation-related fees and expenses), reputational damage, damage to employee perceptions of the company, damage to competitiveness, stock price and shareholder value, and other negative or adverse impacts. Cyber incidents affecting issuers in which Federated Hermes' or its customers' assets are invested also could cause such investments to lose value. Any of these cyber incidents can become incrementally worse if they were to remain undetected for an extended period of time.\nThe operating systems of Federated Hermes, its products, its customers and relevant service providers are dependent on the effectiveness of information security policies and procedures (both at Federated Hermes and its service providers) which seek to ensure that such systems are protected from cyber incidents. Federated Hermes has established a committee to oversee Federated Hermes' information security and data governance efforts, and updates on cyber incidents and risks are reviewed with relevant committees, as well as Federated Hermes' Board of Directors (or a committee thereof), on a periodic (generally\nquarterly) basis (and more frequently when circumstances warrant) as part of risk management oversight responsibilities. Federated Hermes has, and believes its products and its service providers have, established risk management systems that are reasonably designed to seek to reduce the risks associated with cyber incidents. Federated Hermes employs various measures aimed at mitigating cyber risk, including, among others, use of firewalls, system segmentation, system monitoring, virus scanning, periodic penetration testing, employee phishing training and an employee cybersecurity awareness campaign. Among other service provider management efforts, Federated Hermes also conducts due diligence on key service providers relating to cybersecurity. However, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful, either entirely or partially, as there are limits on Federated Hermes' ability to prevent, detect or mitigate cyber incidents. Among other reasons, the cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving, the nature of malicious cyber incidents is becoming increasingly sophisticated and Federated Hermes, and its relevant affiliates and products, cannot control the systems and cybersecurity systems and practices of issuers, relevant service providers or other third parties. Federated Hermes' risk from cyber incidents also can increase as a result of expansion into new markets, domestic or international acquisitions, new technology, or previously unexploited vulnerabilities in software or related patches becoming activated (or \"weaponized\") by hackers.\nWhile Federated Hermes has obtained cyber-insurance, there is no guarantee that a particular incident would be covered by such insurance. In certain circumstances, insurance coverage might not be available or deductible amounts might not be exceeded, and Federated Hermes or the Federated Hermes Funds could have to bear the costs related to claims or any losses or other liabilities resulting from a cyber incident.\nWhile Federated Hermes cannot predict the financial or reputational impact to its business resulting from any cyber incident, depending upon the nature, magnitude and severity of a cyber incident, the occurrence of a cyber incident, or a similar situation or incident, could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. The internal and external resources and efforts necessary to implement system and technology upgrades, data governance and cybersecurity policies, procedures and measures, including, for example, technology, systems, skilled personnel and service providers, as well as service provider management, have, and will continue to, increase Federated Hermes' operating expenses, and can adversely affect, potentially in a material way, Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nOther General Risks\nRecruiting and Retaining Key Personnel. Like other industries, the investment management business is highly competitive and experienced professionals have significant career mobility. Federated Hermes' ability to attract or acquire, and motivate and retain, quality personnel has contributed significantly to its growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining customers. The market for qualified executives, portfolio managers, analysts, traders, sales representatives and other key personnel is extremely competitive. There can be no assurance that Federated Hermes will be successful in its efforts to recruit or acquire, and motivate and retain, the required personnel. In addition to competing opportunities, personnel elect to pursue other interests for business, personal and other reasons or retire from time to time. Covid-19, and related work environment changes, including work from-home arrangements, can create retention and other human capital resource management issues. Cyber events, misconduct or other matters that negatively reflect on Federated Hermes and its reputation also can change employee or prospective employee opinions regarding the company and could affect Federated Hermes' ability to hire or retain employees. Federated Hermes has encouraged the continued retention of its executives and other key personnel through measures such as providing competitive compensation arrangements, a non-discriminatory, diverse and inclusive work environment, work arrangement flexibility (particularly in light of Covid-19) and, in certain cases, employment agreements. The loss of any such personnel could have an adverse effect on Federated Hermes. In certain circumstances, the departure of key employees could cause higher redemption rates for certain AUM or the loss of customer accounts or relationships. Moreover, since certain of Federated Hermes' products and strategies, or customer relationships, contribute significantly to its revenues and earnings, the loss of even a small number of key personnel associated with these products or strategies, or customer relationships, could have a disproportionate adverse impact, potentially in a material way, on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. See Item 1 - Business under the caption Human Capital Resource Management for additional information on Federated Hermes' recruiting and retention programs and practices.\nNo Assurance of Successful Acquisitions. Like other companies, Federated Hermes' business strategy contemplates seeking acquisition candidates. For Federated Hermes, acquisitions generally involve acquisitions of other investment management companies, investment assets and related businesses, both domestically and internationally. There can be no assurance that Federated Hermes will find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and with an aligned business culture and vision, have sufficient capital resources to realize its acquisition strategy, be successful in entering into definitive agreements for or consummating desired acquisitions, or successfully collaborating with acquired companies or integrating acquired companies or assets into Federated Hermes, or its products or strategies. There also can be no assurance that any such acquisitions, if\nconsummated, will not increase organizational stress to unacceptable levels or cause process failures, or that any such acquisition, if consummated, will increase value or otherwise prove to be advantageous to Federated Hermes. On the other hand, successful collaboration with acquired companies or integration of acquired companies or assets can increase the value of such acquired companies or assets and result in increased contingent deferred payments or other payment obligations for Federated Hermes, which can affect Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Reputational Harm. Like other companies, any material losses in customer (including shareholder) confidence in Federated Hermes, its products or strategies or in the mutual fund industry as a result of actual or potential regulatory proceedings or litigation, economic or market downturns or disruptions, material errors in public news reports, oppositions to trade mark or other intellectual property registration applications or allegations of trade name, trade mark or other intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, allegations of breaches of fiduciary duty, misconduct or unprofessional, unethical or illegal behavior, abuse of authority, a cyber incident, rumors on the Internet or other matters could increase redemptions from and/or reduce sales of Federated Hermes' products (such as the Federated Hermes Funds) and strategies and other investment management products and services, change employee or potential employee perceptions of the company which could impact the willingness of a potential employee to be hired by or an employee to remain at Federated Hermes, and/or negatively impact Federated Hermes' brand, culture, trusted status, reputation and/or stock price. For example, if it is determined that Federated Hermes cannot register and use its trade name and logo in certain jurisdictions, Federated Hermes could be required to transact business in such jurisdictions (or globally) under a different trade name and/or logo, which would harm Federated Hermes' brand and reputation. Filings and proceedings relating to the registration and prosecution of trademark applications and the ability for Federated Hermes to use its trade name and logo also can increase expenses for Federated Hermes. There is no guarantee that Federated Hermes' rebranding efforts will be successful. If such losses or events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. With increased focus on sustainability, as well as ESG matters, any perceived deficiency in Federated Hermes' policies and practices on these matters can impact Federated Hermes' brand, reputation or stock price, as well as investor preference for Federated Hermes' securities, products, strategies and services, and, accordingly, adversely affect, potentially in a material way, Federated Hermes' stock price and business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Unpredictable Events or Consequences (including Covid-19). Like other companies, unpredictable events, such as a natural disaster, pandemic (e.g., the Covid-19 outbreak), war, terrorist attack or other business continuity event, or unexpected market, economic or political developments, could adversely impact Federated Hermes', its products', its customers', and each of their respective service providers' ability to conduct business. Such events or consequences could cause disruptions in economic conditions and markets, governmental processes, system interruption, loss of life, unavailability of personnel, an inability to provide information or services, either at all or in accordance with applicable requirements, standards, or restrictions, and/or additional costs.\nA failure in, or disruption to, Federated Hermes' operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage Federated Hermes' reputation and cause Federated Hermes AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Remote working can stress business processes, such as due diligence of service providers, client onboarding and controls, as well as increase cybersecurity, privacy and digital communications risks. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of Federated Hermes' business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside of Federated Hermes' control (particularly in locations where Federated Hermes has offices), or if Federated Hermes fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, Federated Hermes' ability to operate could be adversely impacted which can cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact Federated Hermes' ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, and impact, potentially in a material way, Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Management relies on its employees, systems and business continuity plans, and those relevant service providers, to seek to mitigate such risks, but there can be no guarantee that these mitigation efforts will be successful in whole or in part.\nThere also can be times when industry databases or other third parties publish or distribute information regarding Federated Hermes, or its products or services (including Federated Hermes Fund asset levels), that might be inaccurate or incomplete, and there can be no assurance that a third party will interpret or report information accurately.\nUnpredictable consequences, or side effects, of certain known or planned events, such as the planned phase-out of LIBOR by December 31, 2021 (or, for USD LIBOR by June 30, 2023) and transition to SOFR, SONIA or another alternative interest rate, also could adversely impact Federated Hermes', its products', its customers', and their respective service providers' ability to conduct business. The SEC staff has indicated that the expected discontinuation of LIBOR could have a significant impact on\nthe markets and can present a material risk for certain market participants, including public companies, investment advisors, investment companies and broker/dealers. The phase-out of LIBOR can cause the renegotiation or re-pricing of certain credit facilities, derivatives or other financial transactions to which Federated Hermes, its products, customers or service providers are parties, alter the accounting treatment of certain instruments or transactions, or have other unintended consequences, which, among other effects, could require additional internal and external resources to address, thereby increasing operating expenses. While it is expected that market participants will amend financial instruments referencing LIBOR to include fallback provisions and/or other measures that contemplate the discontinuation of LIBOR or other similar market disruption events, neither the effect of the transition process nor the viability of such measures is known. While market participants have begun transitioning away from LIBOR, there are obstacles to converting certain longer-term securities and transactions to a new benchmark or benchmarks. The effectiveness of multiple alternative reference rates as opposed to one primary reference rate has not been determined, nor has the effectiveness of alternative reference rates used in new or existing financial instruments and products. As market participants transition away from LIBOR, LIBOR's usefulness can deteriorate at any time prior to the deadline for its phase-out. The transition process can lead to increased volatility and illiquidity in markets that currently rely on LIBOR to determine interest rates. LIBOR's deterioration can adversely affect the liquidity and/or market value of securities that use LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate, including securities and other financial instruments held by Federated Hermes or the Federated Hermes Funds. Further, the utilization of an alternative reference rate, or the transition process to an alternative reference rate, can adversely affect Federated Hermes' or the Federated Hermes Funds' performance. As such, there can be no assurance that unpredictable or unexpected events, reports or consequences, or the costs to address such events, inaccurate reports or consequences, would not have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nCovid-19. The outbreak of Covid-19 is an unprecedented event that has been, and continues to be, impossible to predict and could have a material adverse effect on Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or stock price. It has led to global travel restrictions, market disruptions, economic uncertainty and recession, which have impacted markets negatively. The collective mitigation response to Covid-19 has resulted in a sharp contraction in many aspects of the U.S. and global economies, tightening liquidity, and increasing volatility and uncertainty in capital and other markets. These effects of Covid-19 have caused, and can continue to cause, a decline in the value of investments and a decline in the value of certain Federated Hermes' AUM, resulting in lower revenue for Federated Hermes. The economic uncertainty and impact of Covid-19 could continue in the short-term or could last for an extended period of time (depending upon, among other factors, the extent to which vaccines are widely disseminated) and result in a continuing or further economic downturn or recession. Health crises caused by outbreaks, such as Covid-19, can exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic/market risks.\nThe overall impact of Covid-19 has negatively affected, and other epidemics and pandemics that arise in the future could negatively affect, the worldwide economy, as well as the economies of individual countries, national, state or local governments, individual companies (including Federated Hermes, its products and service providers) and the market in general in significant, potentially material, and unforeseen ways. For example, market disruptions and other events relating to Covid-19 have caused, and can continue to cause, market volatility, illiquidity in the money market, fixed income or other markets, a decline in interest rates to near zero with the possibility of negative interest rates, a decline in the value of and/or returns on investments, a decline in the value of Federated Hermes' AUM, an increase in the risk of reduction, elimination or clawback of carried interest or performance fees, changes in asset mix, and increased Fee Waivers, which results in lower revenue and earnings for Federated Hermes. The market disruption and other events relating to Covid-19 also can cause impairment of intangible assets (including goodwill) or other assets, among other effects. It is possible that a remote working environment will increase investor comfort with technology, resulting in more online investment or other changes in investor preferences (such as for passive investments over actively managed investments), increased metric-based decision-making and alternative distribution practices. If essential employees, or a significant number of employees, contract Covid-19 and are unable to perform their duties either at all or only in a significantly diminished capacity, the absence of these employees can adversely impact Federated Hermes' ability to continue to remain fully operational and/or to deliver Federated Hermes' investment products and services. A remote working environment also can reduce opportunities for collaboration among employees, increase stress of processes and the risk of errors, increase cyber risk given the increased cyber attack surface stemming from the use of personal devices or non-office or personal technology in a work-from-home environment, prevent utilization of certain processes or practices (such as the inability to use \"white rooms\" by certain service providers), reduce productivity and efficiency, and create additional risk around \"return to the office\" arrangements. Any scenario whereby Covid-19, and its resulting effects, persist for any significant period of time can adversely affect, potentially in a material way, Federated Hermes' business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or stock price. Federated continues to monitor the impact of Covid-19 on its business, operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 86102, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "FHI"}
