{"cik": "1418135", "company": "Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties, could harm our business and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WITH KEURIG\nOur stockholders may not approve the Transaction.\nThe completion of the Transaction requires the Stockholder Approvals and we can provide no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained.\nThe regulatory approvals and any other required approvals in connection with the Transaction may not be obtained on the proposed terms or on the anticipated schedule.\nThe completion of the Transaction will depend upon a number of conditions being satisfied, including, among others, obtaining all regulatory approvals required to complete the Transaction, including the expiration or early termination of the waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \"HSR Act\") and any required foreign regulatory approvals, and the absence of any injunction prohibiting the Transaction and absence of any legal requirements enacted by a court or other governmental entity since the date of the Merger Agreement that remain in effect prohibiting consummation of the Transaction. We can provide no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained on the anticipated schedule, or at all.\nThe waiting period with respect to the notifications filed under the HSR Act expires 30 calendar days after such filings, unless otherwise extended or terminated. The Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") or Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") may effectively extend the statutory waiting period by requesting additional information regarding the Transaction and its potential effects on competition. Also, at any time before or after completion of the Transaction, the FTC or the DOJ could act under the antitrust laws to prevent a substantial lessening of competition or the creation of a monopoly, including by seeking to enjoin completion of the Transaction or seeking divestiture of our or Keurig\u2019s assets, businesses or product lines.\nThe annual meeting of our stockholders at which the Stockholder Approvals will be considered may take place before all of the required regulatory approvals have been obtained and before all conditions to such approvals, if any, are known. In this event, if the Stockholder Approvals are obtained, we and Maple Parent may subsequently agree to conditions without further seeking stockholder approval, even if such conditions could have an adverse effect on us, Maple Parent or the combined company, except as required by applicable law.\nThe closing of the Transaction is subject to many other conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Transaction will not be completed.\nIn addition to regulatory and other required approvals, the closing of the Transaction is subject to a number of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement that must be satisfied or waived, including the authorization of the listing on the NYSE of the Acquisition Shares and, with respect to DPS\u2019s obligation to close, the securing of debt financing for the Transaction.\nThe closing of the Transaction is also dependent on the accuracy of representations and warranties made by the parties to the Merger Agreement (subject to customary materiality qualifiers and other customary exceptions), the performance in all material respects by the parties of obligations imposed under the Merger Agreement, the absence of a material adverse effect on Maple Parent or us, the receipt of officer certificates by the other party certifying the satisfaction of the preceding conditions, receipt by Maple Parent of the tax opinion from McDermott Will & Emery LLP as to the tax treatment of the Transaction, and receipt by us of the solvency opinion from our solvency advisor. In addition, it is a condition to our obligation to close under the Merger Agreement that the total indebtedness (other than relating to capital leases) of KDP (formerly DPS), after giving effect to the Transaction and the financings related thereto, does not exceed $16.9 billion in the aggregate. There can be no assurance as to whether or when the conditions to the closing of the Transaction will be satisfied or waived or as to whether or when the Transaction will be consummated.\nAny legal proceedings or governmental inquiries in connection with the Transaction, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could delay or prevent the completion of the Transaction.\nIn connection with the Transaction, plaintiffs may file lawsuits against DPS, Maple Parent and/or the directors and officers of either company. In addition, either company may face inquiries from governmental entities in connection with the Transaction. Although we believe any such lawsuits would be meritless, the outcome of such litigation or governmental inquiry is uncertain. Such legal proceedings or governmental inquiries could also prevent or delay the completion of the Transaction and result in additional costs to us.\nDPS stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Transaction and will exercise less influence over management. DPS stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the DPS Board and on other matters affecting DPS.\nUpon the consummation of the Transaction, each DPS stockholder will remain a stockholder of DPS with a percentage ownership of KDP following the Transaction that is smaller than the stockholder\u2019s prior percentage ownership of DPS. It is currently expected that the former stockholders of DPS as a group immediately after the Transaction will own approximately 13% of the outstanding shares of common stock of KDP, on a fully diluted basis. Because of this, DPS stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of KDP than they now have on the management and policies of DPS.\nAlso see \u201c-KDP will meet the requirements to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and, as a result, will qualify for, and intends to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance standards, which limit the presence of independent directors on its board of directors or board committees.\u201d\nFollowing the Transaction, the composition of the KDP Board will be different than the composition of the current DPS Board.\nUpon consummation of the Transaction, the composition of the KDP Board will be different than the current DPS Board. The DPS Board currently consists of 9 directors. Upon the consummation of the Transaction, the KDP Board will consist of 12 members:\n\u2022\neight directors will be appointed by Maple Parent's stockholders, including Keurig's current Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022\ntwo directors will be appointed by DPS, including our current President and Chief Executive Officer; and\n\u2022\ntwo independent directors will be mutually agreed upon by Maple Parent and DPS.\nThis new composition of the board of directors of KDP may affect the future decisions of KDP.\nKDP will meet the requirements to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and, as a result, will qualify for, and intends to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance standards, which limit the presence of independent directors on its board of directors or board committees.\nFollowing the Transaction, approximately 87% of the outstanding common stock of KDP will be held by holders of the equity interests of Maple Parent, on a fully diluted basis, and approximately 13% will be held by the stockholders of DPS, on a fully diluted basis.\nAs a result, KDP will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for purposes of Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and will be exempt from certain governance requirements otherwise required by the NYSE. Under Section 303A, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, including requirements that (1) a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (2) compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors, and (3) director nominees be selected or recommended for selection by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating/corporate governance committee composed solely of independent directors. Following the consummation of the Transaction, KDP will continue to have an audit committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nAs a result, the procedures for approving significant corporate decisions could be determined by directors who have a direct or indirect interest in such decisions and KDP\u2019s stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of other companies that are required to comply with the independence rules of the NYSE.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Transaction may not be consummated. The Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict the ability of the DPS Board to pursue alternatives to the Transaction and to change its recommendation that DPS stockholders vote for the Stockholder Approvals. In specified circumstances, DPS could be required to pay Maple Parent a termination fee of up to $700 million.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the approval of DPS\u2019 stockholders or the effectiveness of the Maple Parent stockholder consent or Merger Sub stockholder consent, by the mutual written consent of the parties, by either Maple Parent or DPS if stockholder or regulatory approvals are not obtained, or by Maple Parent or DPS in connection with certain breaches of the Merger Agreement by DPS or Maple Parent, respectively.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated by DPS pursuant to accepting a superior acquisition proposal and entering into an alternative acquisition agreement, by Maple Parent if our Board changes its recommendation to stockholders to approve the issuance of the Acquisition Shares and amendment to the certificate of incorporation, or by either DPS or Maple Parent because the closing does not occur by October 29, 2018 and there is an acquisition proposal outstanding at the time of such termination and within twelve months of termination of the Merger Agreement DPS consummates or enters into an agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal, DPS shall pay to Maple Parent a termination fee in the amount of $700 million. If the Merger Agreement is terminated by DPS because Maple Parent is unable to obtain required financing on the terms required by the Merger Agreement, Maple Parent shall pay to DPS a reverse termination fee in the amount of $700 million.\nFailure to consummate the Transaction could negatively impact DPS and its future operations.\nIf the Transaction is not consummated for any reason, DPS may be subjected to a number of material risks. The price of shares of DPS common stock may decline to the extent that its current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Transaction will be consummated. In addition, some costs related to the Transaction must be paid by DPS whether or not the Transaction is consummated. Furthermore, DPS may experience negative reactions from its stockholders, customers and employees in the event the Transaction is not consummated. Further, DPS' management would have committed time, financial and other resources to matters relating to the Transaction that could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities for DPS.\nIn addition, if the Transaction is not completed, DPS could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement. The materialization of any of these risks could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business.\nDPS and Keurig will be subject to business uncertainties and certain operating restrictions until consummation of the Transaction.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Transaction on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on DPS, Keurig or KDP following the Transaction. These uncertainties could disrupt our business or the business of Keurig and cause customers, suppliers, vendors, partners and others that deal with us and Keurig to defer entering into contracts with us and Keurig or making other decisions concerning us and Keurig or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us and Keurig. Retention and motivation of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the Transaction due to uncertainty about their future roles and difficulty of integration. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with KDP, KDP\u2019s business following the Transaction could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts DPS from making certain acquisitions and investments and imposes certain other restrictions on the conduct of each party's business until the Transaction occurs without the consent of Keurig. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Transaction.\nThe Merger Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to pursue other alternatives to the Transaction.\nThe Merger Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage, induce or assist any inquiries or the making, submission, announcement or consummation of, proposals or offers that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal. Further, subject to limited exceptions, consistent with applicable law, the Merger Agreement provides that our board will not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) in a manner adverse to Maple Parent its recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of the Stockholder Approvals. Although our Board is permitted to take certain actions in response to a superior proposal or an intervening event if it determines that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, doing so in specified situations could require us to pay to Maple Parent the Termination Fee.\nSuch provisions could discourage a potential acquiror that might have an interest in making a proposal from considering or proposing any such transaction, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value to our stockholders than that to be paid in the Transaction. There also is a risk that the requirement to pay the termination fee or expense payment to Maple Parent in certain circumstances may result in a potential acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.\nIf our due diligence investigation of Keurig was inadequate or if unexpected risks related to Keurig's business materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our stockholders' investment.\nEven though we conducted a due diligence investigation of Keurig, we cannot be sure that our diligence surfaced all material issues that may be present inside Keurig or its business, or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of Keurig and its business and outside of its control will not arise later. If any such material issues arise, they may materially and adversely impact the on-going business of KDP and our stockholders' investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY\nExpected combination benefits from the Transaction may not be fully-realized or realized within the expected time frame.\nThe ability of Keurig and DPS to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction will depend, to a large extent, on KDP\u2019s ability to combine Keurig\u2019s and DPS' businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies, and achieves the projected stand-alone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company. It is expected that KDP will benefit from operational and general and administrative cost synergies resulting from the warehouse and transportation integration, direct procurement savings on overlapping materials, purchasing scale on indirect spend categories and optimization of duplicate positions and processes. KDP may also enjoy revenue synergies, driven by a strong portfolio of brands with exposure to higher growth segments and the ability to leverage our collective distribution strength. In order to achieve these expected benefits, KDP must successfully combine the businesses of Keurig and DPS in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized and must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If KDP experiences difficulties with the integration process or is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe businesses of DPS and Keurig may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected. Operating costs, customer loss and business disruption, including difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers, may be greater than expected following the transaction. Revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected.\nThe combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, Keurig and DPS will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to combining their business practices and operations. This process may disrupt the businesses. The failure to meet the challenges involved in combining the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of KDP and could adversely affect the results of operations of KDP. The overall combination of Keurig\u2019s and DPS\u2019 businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems;\n\u2022\nchallenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nthe transition of management of the combined company from DPS' executive management team to Keurig's executive management team who has limited experience with operating a LRB business;\n\u2022\nintegrating the companies' financial reporting and internal control systems, including compliance by the combined company with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules promulgated by the SEC;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the additional debt financing expected to be incurred in connection with the Transaction;\n\u2022\ncontingent liabilities that are larger than expected; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Transaction.\nMany of these factors are outside of the control of Keurig and DPS and/or will be outside the control of KDP, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of KDP. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses of Keurig and DPS are combined successfully, the full benefits of the Transaction may not be realized, including the synergies or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in combining the businesses of Keurig and DPS. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of KDP, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Transaction, and negatively impact the price of DPS common stock. As a result, it cannot be assured that the combination of Keurig and DPS will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the Transaction within the anticipated time frames or at all.\nIf a credit rating downgrade below investment grade were to occur, DPS may be required to purchase its outstanding notes and may be unable to do so.\nDPS has a substantial amount of debt outstanding, comprised of various series of outstanding notes. These notes generally require DPS to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior unsecured notes of each series at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus, without duplication, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase should DPS undergo a change of control and receive a credit rating downgrade below investment grade. Because the Transaction will constitute a change of control of DPS, if any such series is rated below investment grade by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\"Moody's\") and Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services LLC (\"S&P\") within the first 60 days following the effectiveness of the Transaction, DPS will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior unsecured notes of each such series at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus, without duplication, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. DPS may not have sufficient funds (including as a result of a failure to raise sufficient funds through the debt or equity markets) to finance a required repurchase of such senior unsecured notes by DPS. The failure to finance or complete such an offer would place DPS in default under the indentures governing the senior unsecured notes. Additionally, if there is increased volatility or a disruption in the global capital and credit markets, it could impair DPS\u2019s ability to access these markets for purposes of funding a required repurchase on commercially acceptable terms.\nMaple Parent and DPS will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the Transaction. Maple Parent and DPS will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of consummating the Transaction.\nA portion of the transaction costs related to the Transaction will be incurred regardless of whether the Transaction is consummated. While Maple Parent and DPS have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond Maple Parent\u2019s and DPS\u2019 control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses may exceed the costs historically borne by Maple Parent and DPS. These costs could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of Maple Parent and DPS prior to the Transaction and of KDP following the Transaction.\nThe agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the Transaction may contain various covenants that impose restrictions on KDP and certain of its subsidiaries that may affect its ability to operate its businesses.\nThe agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the Transaction will contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of KDP and certain of its subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of KDP and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on their property, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of their assets to any one person, and engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions. The ability of KDP and its subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate its repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under these circumstances, KDP might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations.\nThe Transaction will expose us to risks inherent in the coffee and appliances business, and risks inherent in those geographies where Keurig currently operates.\nIf consummated successfully, the Transaction would represent a significant transformation of our existing business. Upon completion of the Transaction, we would be subject to a variety of risks associated with the coffee and small appliances business, in addition to those we already face in the LRB industry. These risks include changes in consumer preferences, volatility in the prices of raw materials, consumer perceptions of the brands, competition in the retail market place and other risks. In addition, we will be exposed to risks inherent in operating in geographies in which we have not operated in or have been less present in the past.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CURRENT DPS BUSINESS\nWe may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, trends, health concerns and other factors.\nConsumers' preferences can change due to a variety of factors, including the age and ethnic demographics of the population, social trends, negative publicity, economic downturn or other factors. For example, consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness, focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular CSDs, the use of artificial sweeteners in diet CSDs and the use of natural, organic or simple ingredients in LRB products. As such, the demand for CSDs has decreased as consumers have shifted towards NCBs, such as water, ready-to-drink teas and sports drinks. If we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences and quickly develop new products or partner with an allied brand in that category in response, then our sales could suffer. Developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive. We may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences, and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes, either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nOur distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated.\nApproximately 82% of our 2017 Packaged Beverages net sales of branded products came from our owned and licensed brands and our contract manufacturing, with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as, but not limited to, FIJI mineral water, Big Red, BODYARMOR, Vita Coco coconut water, AriZona tea, Core Hydration, Neuro drinks, High Brew, Hydrive energy drinks and Sparkling Fruit2O. We are subject to a risk of our allied brands, terminating their distribution agreements with us, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Within each distribution agreement, we have certain protections in case the allied brands terminate the distribution agreements, including a one-time termination payment.\nCosts for commodities, such as raw materials and energy, may change substantially.\nThe principal raw materials we use in our products are aluminum cans and ends, glass bottles, PET bottles and caps, paperboard packaging, sweeteners, juice, fruit, water and other ingredients. The cost of such raw materials can fluctuate substantially. Under many of our supply arrangements, the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs, such as aluminum in the case of cans, natural gas in the case of glass bottles, resin in the case of PET bottles and caps, corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging.\nIn addition, we use a significant amount of energy in our business. We are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers. Additionally, conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas.\nPrice increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers. Price increases we pass along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products. Such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Furthermore, price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for mark-to-market changes in the derivative instruments.\nNew or proposed beverage taxes or regulations could impact our sales.\nOver the years, the federal, state and local governments of the U.S. and the federal government of Mexico have imposed or attempted to impose indirect taxes on the manufacturing and/or the distribution of certain sugar-sweetened beverages, which are commonly referred to as a \"beverage tax\" or \"sugar tax\". These regressive taxes were primarily the result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity. As federal, state and local governments in the U.S., and foreign governments experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers continue to single out beverages among a number of revenue-raising items. As such, federal, state, and other local and foreign governments could continue to seek to impose a beverage or sugar tax. Additionally, local and regional governments and school boards have enacted, or have proposed to enact, regulations restricting the sale of certain types or sizes of soft drinks in municipalities and schools as a result of these concerns. Any changes of regulations or imposed taxes may reduce consumer demand for our products or could cause us to raise our prices, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nIf we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses or brands, our operating results may adversely be affected.\nFrom time to time, we acquire businesses, such as Bai Brands, or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and distribution rights. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with the acquisition, integration or management of the acquired businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in integrating them into our operating and internal control structures. We may also experience delays in extending our internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. Our financial performance depends in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of acquired businesses or brands. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for such acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve such objectives, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.\nWe depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business.\nNet sales from our Beverage Concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own. The Beverage Concentrates segment's operations generate a significant portion of our overall segment operating profit (\"SOP\"). Some of these bottlers, such as PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, are also our competitors. The majority of these bottlers' business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors' products. In addition, some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties. As independent companies, these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions. They may have the right to determine whether, and to what extent, they produce and distribute our products, our competitors' products and their own products. They may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands. In most cases, they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause. We may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass price increases through to them. Their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control, and our business could suffer as a result. Deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers. Any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales.\nFood and beverage retailers in the U.S. have been consolidating, resulting in large, sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to provide larger, more tailored promotional and product delivery programs. If we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing, product, packaging, pricing and service to these retailers, our product availability, sales and margins could suffer. Certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products' retail volume, including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands. The loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets.\nThe LRB industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences. Competition is generally based upon brand recognition, taste, quality, price, availability, selection and convenience. Brand recognition can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs, as well as our use of social media. We compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources. Our two largest competitors in the LRB market are Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which represent approximately 42.4% of the U.S. LRB market by retail sales according to IRi. We also compete against other large companies, including Nestle, Kraft Foods and Campbell Soup. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, changing their route to market, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. As a bottler and manufacturer, we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers, such as Cott. Smaller companies may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. We also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers. We have lower exposure to non-premium bottled water and ready-to-drink coffee compared to the overall LRB market. In Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our sales could decline. As a result, we would potentially reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing, advertising and product innovation, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nDeterminations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $10,022 million of total assets, of which approximately $7,342 million were goodwill and other intangible assets. Intangible assets include both definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets in connection with brands, distribution rights and customer relationships. We conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, as of October 1, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We recognized approximately $1 million in impairment charges for our Aguafiel brand based upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of October 1, 2017. For additional information about these intangible assets, see \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in Item 7 and Note 2 and Note 4 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets. An impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products and/or the product category; (ii) higher commodity prices; (iii) lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition; (iv) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events; and (v) changes in our discount rates. Since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles will occur in the future. Any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our Consolidated Statements of Income, which could adversely affect our results of operations and increase our effective tax rate.\nOur total indebtedness, excluding capital lease obligations, could affect our operations and profitability.\nWe maintain levels of debt we consider prudent based on our actual and expected cash flows. As of December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness was $4,479 million.\nThis amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors, including requiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, which could impact our debt maturity profile.\nWhile we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and will have access to additional sources of capital in the future if and when needed, that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time, the then-current state of the credit and financial markets, and other factors that may be beyond our control.\nIn assessing our credit strength, credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as our results of operations and financial position at that time. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, the credit agencies' perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our current or future results of operations and financial position or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in Mexico and Canada may adversely affect our operating results.\nWhile our operations are predominately in the U.S., we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in the Mexican peso or the Canadian dollar. We manage a small portion of our exposure to the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso for certain transactions utilizing derivative instruments and are not protected against most foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover, any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit, gross margin, income from operations or segment operating profit from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year.\nWe depend on key information systems and third party service providers.\nWe depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business, provide information to management and prepare financial reports. We rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services, including hosting our primary data center and processing various benefit-related accounting and transactional services. These systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from, among other things, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, processing errors, computer viruses, other security issues or supplier defaults. Security, backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures. Any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors, processing inefficiencies, security breaches, inability to use the systems or process transactions, loss of customers or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nAs cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase, our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information, disrupting business processes or corrupting information. These risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event, which could adversely affect our business.\nIncreases in our cost of benefits in the future could reduce our profitability.\nOur profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care, pension and other retirement programs and other benefits. In recent years, these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs, increases in participants enrolled, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. These factors plus the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance. Although we actively seek to control increases in costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOur financial results may be negatively impacted by recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions.\nChanges in economic and financial conditions in the U.S., Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume and/or switching to lower price offerings. Similarly, disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. These disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials. Additionally, these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of unsecured commercial paper or senior notes.\nWe could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedging arrangements. Declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund, which in turn could increase funding requirements.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings which may include employment, tort, real estate, commercial and other litigation. From time to time we are a defendant in class action litigation, including litigation regarding employment practices, product labeling, and wage and hour laws. Plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts which are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. We will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies. We base our assessments, estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates. Costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost of actual settlements, judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance. Any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCertain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur.\nSome raw materials we use, such as aluminum cans and ends, glass bottles, PET bottles, sweeteners, fruit, juice and other ingredients, are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases. Changing suppliers can require long lead times. The failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, crop failure, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political instability, cybersecurity attacks and terrorism. A failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers' financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. Some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or less-developed countries or regions. Any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance.\nSubstantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur.\nA disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility, which manufactures almost all of our concentrates, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers, bottlers or distributors. The disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, water scarcity, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation or supply interruption, government regulation, cybersecurity attacks or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe may fail to comply with applicable government laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and other countries in which we do business. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of our products. See \"Regulatory Matters\" in Item 1, \"Business,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations.\nViolations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. In addition, any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations, could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of food products is increasing. Certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products, such as California's \"Prop 65,\" which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, are or could become applicable to our products.\nWeather, natural disasters, climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business.\nUnseasonable or unusual weather, natural disasters or long-term climate changes may negatively impact the demand for our products, our ability to produce our products and the price or availability of raw materials, energy and fuel. Unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance.\nThere is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns (\"global warming\"). Concern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions. For example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on GHG emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we operate. Laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results.\nWe also may be faced with water availability risks. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. Climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate, and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.\nOur products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated.\nWe have adopted various quality, environmental, health and safety standards. However, our products may not meet these standards or could become contaminated. A failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, distributors or suppliers. This could result in expensive production interruptions, recalls, liability claims and negative publicity. Moreover, negative publicity also could be generated from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. Any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. As these audits and negotiations progress, events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved. As a result, there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions. In addition, our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules, tax regulations or interpretations of existing law. In addition, tax legislation may be enacted in the future, domestically or abroad, that impacts our effective tax rate.\nWe may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or we could experience strikes.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 7,500 of our employees, many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations, were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates. We may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all. This could result in strikes or work stoppages, which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales. The terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency.\nOur intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property, including termination of distribution rights, could harm our business.\nWe possess intellectual property that is important to our business. This intellectual property includes ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. See \"Intellectual Property and Trademarks\" in Item 1, \"Business,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. We and third parties, including competitors, could come into conflict over intellectual property rights. Litigation could disrupt our business, divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our brands, products and business could be harmed.\nWe also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties. In some countries, other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the U.S., Canada or Mexico. For example, the Dr Pepper trademark and formula is owned by Coca-Cola in certain other countries. Adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of these trademarks or negatively impact our brands.\nIn some cases, we license products from third parties that we distribute. The licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice, in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee. The termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading.\nWe have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing, distribution and other facilities. We expect to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep up-to-date various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations, including closing existing facilities or opening new ones. If our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities, our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected.\nWe could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel.\nOur performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them. Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them. If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected. We do not have \"key person\" life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees.", "PERMNO": 79588, "SIC": 2090, "TIC": "KDP"}
