{"cik": "352363", "company": "Kate Spade & Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, in evaluating us and our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can we assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may impact our business.\nOur business strategy is centered on the kate spade new york brand. We cannot assure the successful implementation and results of our long-term strategic plans, including our ability to operate as a mono-brand company.\nOur ability to execute our long-term growth plan and achieve our projected results is subject to a variety of risks, including the following:\n\u2022 We are exposed to additional risk from lack of diversification that did not affect our prior multi-brand business strategy as significantly. Our business prospects and results of operations will depend substantially on our ability to successfully maintain and develop the brand image and brand equity of the kate spade new york brand.\n\u2022 The kate spade new york brand could be negatively affected by changes in consumer preferences, brand awareness and fashion trends, and any such changes or other adverse events could have a more significant impact on a single family of brands than a portfolio of multiple brands.\n\u2022 We may be unable to successfully acquire new full-price customers through our marketing and CRM initiatives.\n\u2022 We may not be able to maintain and improve our operating margins and control promotional activity.\n\u2022 We may not be able to successfully absorb the KATE SPADE SATURDAY business as a label under kate spade new york, and we may not be able to successfully transition JACK SPADE to its new business model.\n\u2022 We may not be able to achieve our revenue growth targets because of local, regional, national and worldwide macroeconomic factors that may reduce demand for our products.\n\u2022 We may be unable to grow our revenues through retail expansion because of risks associated with selecting suitable locations for stand-alone retail stores and appropriate department store locations.\n\u2022 We may not be able to expand internationally, including in Japan, China, Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia, because of local and regional risks associated with those markets, including currency risks, political climate and other similar risks. The joint ventures we expect to form may not succeed in expanding our business in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau.\n\u2022 We may not be able to gain new customers by managing our price points and introducing new product categories, including watches, jewelry, sunglasses and fragrances.\n\u2022 Our e-commerce expansion is subject to risks associated with a material disruption in our information technology systems and e-commerce operations, and with the introduction of government regulations, including in markets outside of the United States, which could cause unfavorable changes or for which failure by us to comply could substantially harm our e-commerce business.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our long-term growth plan, and our inability to successfully expand our retail business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions in the US, Asia, Europe and other parts of the world, including a continued weakening or instability of such economies, restricted credit markets and lower levels of consumer spending, can affect consumer confidence and consumer purchases of discretionary items, including fashion apparel and related products, such as ours.\nOur results are dependent on a number of factors impacting consumer spending, both in the US and abroad, including, but not limited to: (i) general economic and business conditions; (ii) consumer confidence; (iii) wages and current and expected employment levels; (iv) the housing market; (v) consumer\ndebt levels; (vi) availability of consumer credit; (vii) credit and interest rates; (viii) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (ix) fuel and energy costs; (x) energy shortages; (xi) the performance of the financial, equity and credit markets; (xii) taxes; (xiii) general political conditions; and (xiv) the level of customer traffic within department stores, malls and other shopping and selling environments.\nGlobal economic conditions over the past few years have included significant recessionary pressures and declines or stagnation in employment levels, disposable income and actual and/or perceived wealth and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth. The current negative economic environment has been characterized by stagnation in consumer discretionary spending and has disproportionately affected retailers and sellers of consumer goods, particularly those whose goods represent discretionary purchases, including fashion apparel and related products such as ours. While the decline in consumer spending has recently moderated, these economic conditions could still lead to additional declines or stagnation in consumer spending over the foreseeable future and may have resulted in a resetting of consumer spending habits that makes it unlikely that such spending will return to prior levels for the foreseeable future. A number of our markets continue to suffer particularly severe downturns, and we have experienced significant declines in revenues.\nWhile we have seen intermittent signs of stabilization in North America, there continues to be volatility in the European markets and there are no assurances that the global economy will continue to recover. If the global economy continues to be weak or deteriorates further, there will likely be a negative effect on our revenues, operating margins and earnings across all of our segments.\nEconomic conditions have also led to a highly promotional environment and strong discounting pressure from both our wholesale and retail customers, which have had a negative effect on our revenues and profitability. This promotional environment may likely continue even after economic growth returns, as we expect that consumer spending trends are likely to remain at historically depressed levels for the foreseeable future. The domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities could lead to further decreases in consumer spending. The uncertain outlook in the global economy will likely continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor, marketing and transportation, could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales or our ability to meet our customers' demands. The prices for such fabrics depend largely on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them. Such factors may be exacerbated by legislation and regulations associated with global climate change. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors. In the future, we may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher prices on to our customers.\nOur business and balance sheets are exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.\nWhile we generally purchase our products in US dollars, we source most of our products overseas. As a result, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies, including currency devaluations. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the US dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. Our international sales, as well as our international businesses' inventory and accounts receivable levels, could be affected by currency fluctuations. In addition, with expected international expansion, we may increase our exposure to such fluctuations.\nAlthough we from time to time hedge a portion of our exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to constantly changing consumer demands and tastes and fashion trends, across multiple brands, product lines, shopping channels and geographies.\nThe apparel and accessories industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and tastes and fashion trends and to levels of discretionary spending, especially for fashion apparel and related products, which levels are currently weak. These industries are also subject to the difficulties contracted when trying to expand business to growing markets worldwide. We believe that our success is largely dependent on our ability to effectively anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes across multiple product lines, shopping channels and geographies, in the design, pricing, styling and production of our products and in the merchandising and pricing of products in our retail stores, and in the business model employed, and partners we select to work with, in new and growing markets worldwide. Our brands and products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to constant change. Also, we must maintain and enhance favorable brand recognition, which may be affected by consumer attitudes towards the desirability of fashion products bearing a \"mega brand\" label and which are widely available at a broad range of retail stores. Our success is also dependent on our ability to successfully extend our businesses into new territories and markets, such as Europe, Asia and Latin America.\nWe attempt to schedule a substantial portion of our materials and manufacturing commitments relatively late in the production cycle. However, in order to secure necessary materials and ensure availability of manufacturing facilities, we must make substantial advance commitments, which may be up to five months or longer, prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers for the items to be produced. We need to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings relatively far in advance, while minimizing excess inventory positions, and correctly balance the level of our fabric and/or merchandise commitments with actual customer orders.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles and brands or successfully meet changing customer and consumer demands in the future. In addition, we cannot assure that any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received and supported by our wholesale customers or consumers. Our failure to gauge consumer needs and fashion trends by brand and respond appropriately, or to appropriately forecast our ability to sell products, could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and leave us with substantial outstanding fabric and/or manufacturing commitments, resulting in increases in unsold inventory or missed opportunities. If that occurs, we may need to employ markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess inventory, which may harm our business and results. At the same time, our focus on inventory management may result, from time to time, in our not having a sufficient supply of products to meet demand and cause us to lose potential sales.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within the US and abroad.\nWe face intense competitive challenges from other domestic and foreign fashion apparel and accessories producers and retailers. Competition is based on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;\n\u2022 establishing and maintaining favorable brand name and recognition;\n\u2022 product quality;\n\u2022 maintaining and growing market share;\n\u2022 exploiting markets outside of the US, including growth markets such as Europe, Asia and Latin America;\n\u2022 developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers;\n\u2022 establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with our retail customers;\n\u2022 pricing products appropriately;\n\u2022 providing appropriate service and support to retailers;\n\u2022 optimizing our retail and supply chain capabilities;\n\u2022 size and location of our retail stores and department store selling space; and\n\u2022 protecting intellectual property.\nIn addition, some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories, footwear and apparel industries, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products. The general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.\nAny increased competition, or our failure to adequately address these competitive factors, could result in reduced sales or prices, or both, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We also believe there is an increasing focus by the department stores to concentrate an increasing portion of their product assortments within their own private label products. These private label lines compete directly with our product lines and may receive prominent positioning on the retail floor by department stores. Finally, in the current economic environment, which is characterized by softening demand for discretionary items, such as apparel and related products, there has been a consistently increased level of promotional activity, both at our retail stores and at department stores, which has had an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nOur current level of debt could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.\nAs of January 3, 2015, the total principal amount of our term loan credit facility due April 2021 (the \"Term Loan Credit Agreement\") was $398.0 million. Our current level of debt could have important consequences for the holders of our common stock, including: (i) making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt or to our trade or other creditors; (ii) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; (iii) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited; (iv) requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements; (v) limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and (vi) placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us through capital markets financings or under our ABL Facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations or to repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional debt or equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.\nRestrictive covenants in our ABL Facility and the Term Loan Credit Agreement may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe agreement governing our ABL Facility and the Term Loan Credit Agreement limit our ability, and the terms of any future indebtedness may limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 make certain investments;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock;\n\u2022 sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 agree to restrictions on distributions, transfers or dividends affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022 incur liens; and\n\u2022 designate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the agreement governing our ABL Facility (i) provides for a decrease in fees and interest rates compared to our previous asset-based revolving loan facility (including eurocurrency spreads of 1.50% to 2.00% over LIBOR, depending on the level of aggregate availability); (ii) requires us to maintain pro forma compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0:1.0 on a trailing four-quarter basis if availability under the ABL Facility for three consecutive business days falls below the greater of $15.0 million and 10.0% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments and the borrowing base and (iii) requires the Company to apply substantially all cash collections to reduce outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility if availability under the ABL Facility for three consecutive business days falls below the greater of $20.0 million and 12.5% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments and the borrowing base.\nThe restrictions contained in the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the agreement governing our ABL Facility could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans.\nWe may require additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us.\nOur primary ongoing cash requirements are to: (i) fund seasonal working capital needs (primarily accounts receivable and inventory); (ii) fund capital expenditures related to the opening and refurbishing of our specialty retail and outlet stores and normal maintenance activities; (iii) fund remaining efforts associated with our streamlining initiatives, including contract termination costs, employee-related costs and other costs associated with the exit of the KATE SPADE SATURDAY business, the closure of the JACK SPADE stores and the sales of the Juicy Couture IP and Lucky Brand as discussed above; (iv) invest in our information systems; (v) fund general operational and contractual obligations; and (vi) potentially repurchase or retire debt obligations. The expansion and development of our business may also require significant capital, which we may be unable to obtain, to fund our capital expenditures and operating expenses, including working capital needs.\nOur ABL Facility matures in May 2019. Availability under the ABL Facility is the lesser of $200.0 million and a borrowing base that is computed monthly and comprised of our eligible cash, accounts receivable and inventory. The ABL Facility also includes a swingline subfacility of $30.0 million, a multicurrency subfacility of $35.0 million and the option to expand the facility by up to $100.0 million under certain specified conditions. A portion of the facility provided under the ABL Facility of up to $125.0 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit, and standby letters of credit may not exceed $40.0 million in\nthe aggregate. The ABL Facility allows two borrowing options; one borrowing option with interest rates based on eurocurrency rates and a second borrowing option with interest rates based on the alternate base rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with a spread based on the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nDuring the next 12 months, we otherwise expect to meet our cash requirements with existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our ABL Facility. We may fail to generate sufficient cash flow from such sources to meet our cash requirements. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities.\nTo a large extent, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity, or obtain additional equity or debt financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow, refinance our indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms could adversely affect our financial condition and could cause us to be unable to service our debt and may delay or prevent the expansion of our business.\nOur success will depend on our ability to successfully develop or acquire new product lines and enter new markets or product categories.\nWe have in the past, and may, from time to time, acquire or develop new product lines, enter new markets or product categories, including through licensing arrangements, and/or implement new business models. Such activities are accompanied by a variety of risks inherent in any such new business venture, including the following:\n\u2022 our ability to identify appropriate business development opportunities, including new product lines and new markets, including important growth markets such as Europe, Asia and Latin America;\n\u2022 new businesses, business models, product lines or market activities may require methods of operations, investments and marketing and financial strategies different from those employed in our other businesses, and may also involve buyers, store customers and/or competitors different from our historical buyers, store customers and competitors;\n\u2022 consumer acceptance of the new products or lines, and the impact on existing businesses given the new products or lines, including the pricing of such lines;\n\u2022 we may not be able to generate projected or satisfactory levels of sales, profits and/or return on investment for a new business or product line, and may also encounter unanticipated events and unknown or uncertain liabilities that could materially impact our business;\n\u2022 we may experience possible difficulties, delays and/or unanticipated costs in integrating the business, operations, personnel and/or systems of an acquired business and may also not be able to retain and appropriately motivate key personnel of an acquired business;\n\u2022 risks related to complying with different laws and regulations in new markets;\n\u2022 we may not be able to maintain product licenses, which are subject to agreement with a variety of terms and conditions, or to enter into new licenses to enable us to launch new products and lines; and\n\u2022 with respect to a business where we are not the brand owner, but instead act as an exclusive licensee or an exclusive supplier, such as the arrangements within our Adelington Design Group discussed above for the LIZ CLAIBORNE and MONET brands, there are a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, compliance with terms set forth in the applicable agreements, the level of orders placed by our business partners and the public perception and/or acceptance of our business partners, the brands or other product lines, which are not within our control.\nThere are risks associated with the wind-down of our KATE SPADE SATURDAY business and the changes to the business model for JACK SPADE, including closure of our JACK SPADE retail store operations.\nOn January 29, 2015, we announced strategic initiatives to further focus our business on the long-term growth of the kate spade new york brand, including closing down our KATE SPADE SATURDAY business and the transition to a new business model for the JACK SPADE brand. As part of these announcements, we are absorbing key elements of KATE SPADE SATURDAY into the kate spade new york business and discontinuing KATE SPADE SATURDAY as a standalone business.\nIn connection with the KATE SPADE SATURDAY wind-down, retail store locations bearing the KATE SPADE SATURDAY tradename will be closed in a phased approach, as well as the operations of our KATE SPADE SATURDAY wholesale business, including with our international distributors, during the first half of 2015. The KATE SPADE SATURDAY e-commerce site, however, will remain active during this wind-down phase until the label is incorporated and reintroduced into the kate spade new york business. With respect to the JACK SPADE business, we will be closing the JACK SPADE retail stores, while seeking to expand our wholesale distribution of the brand, and our JACK SPADE e-commerce platform. In connection with the KATE SPADE SATURDAY and JACK SPADE actions, we estimate total restructuring charges of $32.0-$39.0 million (related to these actions, including: (i) estimated contract assignment and termination costs of $21.0-$25.0 million; (ii) employee-related costs (including severance) of $4.0-$5.0 million); and (iii) non-cash asset impairment charges of $7.0-$9.0 million. Such estimates do not reflect any other transactions with our contractual counterparties to mitigate the charges. Actual restructuring and transition charges and impairment charges may materially exceed our estimates due to various factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, without limitation, the actual outcomes of discussions and negotiations (a number of which are currently ongoing) with the counterparties to the contracts we intend to terminate or modify. Because of uncertainties with respect to our transition plan (including those described above), we may not be able to complete and implement our transition plan with respect to the KATE SPADE SATURDAY and JACK SPADE businesses as we expect or in a satisfactory manner, and the costs incurred in connection with such transition may exceed our estimates. If the actual restructuring and transition charges or impairment charges exceed our estimates or if our transition plan is not implemented as expected, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurthermore, because of the wind-down of the KATE SPADE SATURDAY brand and because of other factors that ordinarily influence consumer acceptance of our products (many of which are outside our control), we may not be able to sell our KATE SPADE SATURDAY summer 2015 products at prices that will generate a profit. If we incur losses relating to the sales of such products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the announced activities involve numerous risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 the inability of the KATE SPADE SATURDAY business to retain qualified personnel necessary for the wind-down during the wind-down period;\n\u2022 potential disruption of the operations of the rest of our brands and businesses and diversion of management attention from such businesses and operations;\n\u2022 exposure to unknown, contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the KATE SPADE SATURDAY wind-down;\n\u2022 negative impact on our business relationships, including relationships with our customers, suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensees and employees;\n\u2022 the inability to increase the customer base of our JACK SPADE brand; and\n\u2022 unintended negative consequences from changes to our business profile.\nIf any of these or other factors impair our ability to successfully implement the wind-down, we may not be able to realize other business opportunities as we may be required to spend additional time and incur additional expense relating to the wind-down that otherwise would be used on the development and expansion of our other businesses.\nThere are risks associated with the various businesses we have disposed, including our ability to collect the full amount of principal and interest due and owing pursuant to a three year note issued by Lucky Brand Dungarees, LLC to us as partial consideration for the sale of the Lucky Brand business and our ability to comply with our transition service requirements with respect to the Lucky Brand business and other risks related to the transitions of those businesses.\nAs part of the consideration for the sale of the Lucky Brand business, we have received the Lucky Brand Note due 2017 in an aggregate initial principal amount of $85.0 million issued by Lucky Brand LLC and guaranteed by substantially all of its subsidiaries. The Lucky Brand Note is secured by a second-priority lien on all accounts receivable and inventory of Lucky Brand LLC and the guarantor subsidiaries and a first-priority lien on all other collateral of Lucky Brand LLC and the guarantors. The accounts receivable and inventory secure Lucky Brand LLC's asset-based revolving loan facility on a first-priority basis, and the other collateral secures that loan facility on a second-priority basis. The principal amount of the Lucky Brand Note increases by $5.0 million per year, in equal monthly increments, and bears cash interest of $8.0 million per year, payable semiannually in arrears. The Lucky Brand Note is prepayable at any time by Lucky Brand LLC without a prepayment premium, subject to certain restrictions as to the minimum amount that may be prepaid without our consent. To the extent that the business, financial condition and results of operations of Lucky Brand LLC are adversely affected, Lucky Brand LLC's ability to service the Lucky Brand Note or to repay or refinance the Lucky Brand Note could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, our ability to receive payments on the Lucky Brand Note is dependent on such factors, and we may not receive timely payments or be paid the amounts due under the Lucky Brand Note at all.\nUnder a transition services agreement with Lucky Brand LLC, we are required to provide Lucky Brand LLC with certain transitional services, such as IT support, accounting services, tax services and other services that were provided at the corporate level while Lucky Brand was owned by us. The services will be provided at cost for up to a maximum of two years from the closing date, subject to earlier termination of the various services by Lucky Brand LLC. The provision of these services may cause disruption of the operations of the rest of our brands and businesses and diversion of management attention from such businesses and operations.\nIn addition, in connection with the disposition of the Lucky Brand business, LIZ CLAIBORNE Canada retail stores, the LIZ CLAIBORNE branded outlet stores in the US and Puerto Rico and certain Mexx Canada retail stores, an aggregate of 277 store leases were assigned to third parties, for which we or certain of our subsidiaries remain secondarily liable for the remaining obligations on 185 such leases. See \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Commitments and Capital Expenditures,\" and Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOur wholesale businesses are dependent to a significant degree on sales to a limited number of large US department store customers, and our business could suffer as a result of consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies, other ownership changes in the retail industry or financial difficulties at our large department store customers.\nMany major department store groups make centralized buying decisions. Accordingly, any material change in our relationship with any such group could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our wholesale sales.\nOur continued partial dependence on sales to a limited number of large US department store customers is subject to our ability to respond effectively to, among other things: (i) these customers' buying patterns, including their purchase and retail floor space commitments for apparel in general (compared with other product categories they sell) and our products specifically (compared with products offered by our competitors, including with respect to customer and consumer acceptance, pricing and new product introductions); (ii) these customers' strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued focus on further development of their \"private label\" initiatives; (iii) these customers' desire to have us provide them with exclusive and/or differentiated designs and product mixes; (iv) these customers' requirements for vendor margin support; (v) any credit risks presented by these customers, especially given the significant proportion of our accounts receivable they represent; and (vi) the effect of any potential consolidation among these larger customers.\nWe do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our wholesale customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. As a result of the recent unfavorable economic environment, we have experienced a softening of demand from a number of wholesale customers, such as large department stores, who have been highly promotional and have aggressively marked down all of their merchandise, including our products. Any promotional pricing or discounting in response to softening demand may also have a negative effect on brand image and prestige, which may be difficult to counteract once the economy improves. Furthermore, this promotional activity may lead to requests from those customers for increased markdown allowances at the end of the season. Promotional activity at our wholesale customers will also often result in promotional activity at our retail stores, further eroding revenues and profitability.\nWe sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores across the US and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to our receivables from that customer. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Moreover, the difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact our customers and consumers which, in turn, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nA material disruption in our information technology systems and e-commerce operations could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology (\"IT\") systems to track inventory, manage our supply chain, record and process transactions, manage customer communications, summarize results and manage our business. The failure of our IT systems to operate properly or effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or difficulty in integrating new systems could adversely impact our business. In addition, our IT systems may be subject to damage and/or interruption from power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, security breaches and\nusage errors by our employees and harmful acts by our website visitors. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data (including customer data) and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim. Any significant disruption in our IT systems could harm our reputation and credibility and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as our ability to effect the transitions of the recently sold businesses.\nPrivacy breaches and liability for online content could negatively affect our reputation, credibility and business.\nWe rely on third party computer hardware, software and fulfillment operations for our e-commerce operations and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. There is a growing concern over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. Despite the implementation of reasonable security measures by us and our third party providers, these sites and systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches. Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally-identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers. Additionally, as the number of users of forums and social media features on our websites increases, we could be exposed to liability in connection with material posted on our websites by users and other third parties. Finally, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information and, if we fail to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies.\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with credit card fraud and identity theft.\nA growing portion of our customer orders are placed through our e-commerce websites. In addition, a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales require us and other parties involved in processing transactions to collect and to securely transmit certain customer data, such as credit card information, over public networks. Third parties may have the ability to breach the security of customer transaction data. Although we take the security of our systems and the privacy of our customers' confidential information seriously, there can be no assurances that our security measures will effectively prevent others from obtaining unauthorized access to our information and our customers' information. Any security breach could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our website or stores and choose not to purchase from us. Any security breach could also expose us to risks of data loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and harm our reputation, any of which could harm our business.\nWe cannot assure that we can attract and retain talented, highly qualified executives, or maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, both upon the continued services of our executive management team, including brand-level executives, as well as our ability to attract, hire, motivate and retain additional talented and highly qualified management in the future, including the areas of design, merchandising, sales, supply chain, marketing, production and systems, as well as our ability to hire and train qualified retail management and associates. In addition, we will need to provide for the succession of senior management, including brand-level executives. The loss of key members of management and our failure to successfully plan for succession could disrupt our operations and our ability to successfully operate our business and execute our strategic plan.\nOur business could suffer if we cannot adequately establish, defend and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are significantly important to our success and competitive position. Accordingly, we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities. Counterfeiting of our products, particularly our kate spade new york brand, continues, however, and in the course of our international expansion we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed ownership rights in some of our trademarks or otherwise have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have, in the past, resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the actions taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights might not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights. Moreover, in certain countries others may assert rights in, or ownership of, our trademarks and other proprietary rights or we may not be able to successfully resolve such conflicts, or resolving such conflicts may require us to make significant monetary payments. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the US. The loss of such trademarks and other proprietary rights, or the loss of the exclusive use of such trademarks and other proprietary rights, could have a material adverse effect on us. Any litigation regarding our trademarks or other proprietary rights could be time consuming and costly.\nOur reliance on independent foreign manufacturers could cause delay and loss and damage our reputation and customer relationships. Also, there are risks associated with our agreement with Li & Fung, which results in a single foreign buying/sourcing agent for a significant portion of our products.\nWe do not own any product manufacturing facilities; all of our products are manufactured in accordance with our specifications through arrangements with independent suppliers. Products produced in Asia represent a substantial majority of our sales. We also source product in the US and other regions, including approximately 151 suppliers manufacturing our products. At the end of 2014, such suppliers were located in 15 countries, with the largest finished goods supplier at such time accounting for approximately 12.0% of the total of finished goods we purchased in 2014. A supplier's failure to manufacture and deliver products to us in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. The failure to make timely deliveries may drive customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us and our reputation in the marketplace. Also, a manufacturer's failure to comply with safety and content regulations and standards, including with respect to children's product and fashion jewelry, could result in substantial liability and damage to our reputation. While we provide our manufacturers with standards, and we employ independent testing for safety and content issues, we might not be able to prevent or detect all failures of our manufacturers to comply with such standards and regulations.\nAdditionally, we require our independent manufacturers (as well as our licensees) to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While we believe that our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us (or any of our licensees), or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's (or licensee's) labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the US, could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOn February 23, 2009, we entered into a long-term, buying/sourcing agency agreement with Li & Fung, pursuant to which Li & Fung acts as the primary global apparel and accessories buying/sourcing agent, with the exception of our jewelry product lines. We pay to Li & Fung an agency commission based on the cost of our product purchases through Li & Fung. We are obligated to use Li & Fung as our buying/sourcing agent for a minimum value of inventory purchases each year through the termination of the agreement in 2019. Our agreement with Li & Fung is not exclusive; however, we are required to source a specified percentage of product purchases from Li & Fung.\nOur arrangements with foreign suppliers and with our foreign buying/sourcing agents are subject generally to the risks of doing business abroad, including currency fluctuations and revaluations, restrictions on the transfer of funds, terrorist activities, labor disputes, pandemic disease and, in certain parts of the world, political, economic and currency instability. Our operations have not been materially affected by any such factors to date. However, due to the very substantial portion of our products that are produced abroad, any substantial disruption of our relationships with our foreign suppliers could adversely affect our operations. Moreover, difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact our suppliers, which in turn, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our arrangement to continue to operate the Ohio distribution facility with a third party operations and labor management company that provides distribution operations services, including risks related to increased operating expenses, systems capabilities and operating under a third party arrangement.\nIn connection with our streamlining initiatives, in July 2011, we announced our plan to close our Ohio Facility in the second half of 2012 and migrate the distribution function to a third party service provider, and that we had entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (the \"Agreement\") between us and the Chicago and Midwest Regional Joint Board of Workers United (the \"Union\"), which was ratified by the Union. The Agreement set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which we had planned to effectuate orderly layoffs of our employees at the Ohio Facility, in connection with the anticipated closure and sale of the Ohio Facility in the fourth quarter of 2012. The Agreement provided, among other things, that the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the Union, effective June 17, 2008 to June 16, 2011, as previously extended to July 16, 2011 by the parties (the \"CBA\"), were to remain in effect during the expected shutdown of the Ohio Facility, except as such terms are amended by the Agreement. In August 2011, we entered into an agreement with Li & Fung for the provision of distribution services in the United States and at that time we planned to migrate from our Ohio Facility to the Li & Fung facility.\nIn August 2012, we encountered systems and operational issues that delayed the planned migration of our product distribution function out of the Ohio Facility. Subsequently, we determined that we would continue to use the Ohio Facility and discontinue the migration of the product distribution function to Li & Fung, and we mutually agreed with Li & Fung to allow the distribution agreement with Li & Fung to expire as of January 31, 2013. In connection with such expiration, we decided that, given the complex distribution needs of our businesses, we should continue to use the Ohio Facility, and on February 5, 2013, we entered into a contract with a third-party distribution center operations and labor management company to provide distribution operations services at the Ohio Facility. These actions resulted in charges related to contract terminations, severance, asset impairments and other charges and were substantially completed in the second quarter of 2013.\nIn addition, we notified the employees covered by the Agreement of the completion of layoffs on March 31, 2013, at which time the Agreement and CBA terminated. The third-party distribution center operations company employs many of our prior employees, including union employees, at the Ohio Facility. There are a number of risks associated with continuing to operate the Ohio Facility, including increased operating expenses, risks related to systems capabilities at the Ohio Facility and risks related to the ability of the third-party distribution center operations company to appropriately staff the Ohio Facility\nwith both union and non-union employees on reasonable and appropriate terms. We also have limited ability to control our third-party distribution center operations company, and such company may take actions with respect to its employees without our approval and may not maintain good relations with its employees and unions. Issues that arise in connection with the operation of our Ohio Facility could cause supply disruptions and other logistical issues and could therefore have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur international sourcing operations are subject to a variety of legal, regulatory, political, labor and economic risks, including risks relating to the importation and exportation of product.\nWe source most of our products outside the US through arrangements with independent suppliers in 15 countries as of January 3, 2015. There are a number of risks associated with importing our products, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022 the potential reimposition of quotas, which could limit the amount and type of goods that may be imported annually from a given country, in the context of a trade retaliatory case;\n\u2022 changes in social, political, legal and economic conditions, or labor unrest or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located;\n\u2022 the imposition of additional regulations, or the administration of existing regulations, relating to products which are imported, exported or otherwise distributed;\n\u2022 the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes and other charges or other trade barriers on imports or exports;\n\u2022 risks of increased sourcing costs, including costs for materials and labor and such increases potentially resulting from the elimination of quota on apparel products;\n\u2022 our ability to adapt to and compete effectively in the current quota environment, in which general quota has expired on apparel products, resulting in changing in sourcing patterns and lowered barriers to entry, but political activities which could result in the reimposition of quotas or other restrictive measures have been initiated or threatened;\n\u2022 significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security considerations;\n\u2022 the imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty proceedings resulting in the potential assessment of special anti-dumping or countervailing duties; and\n\u2022 the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations, or executive action affecting international textile agreements, including the US reevaluation of the trading status of certain countries and/or retaliatory duties, quotas or other trade sanctions, which, if enacted, would increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries.\nAny one of these or similar factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and current business practices.\nWe face risks associated with operating in international markets.\nApproximately 21.0% of our revenues were generated by operations outside the US during the 2014 fiscal year. Our ability to operate and be successful in new international markets and to operate and maintain the current level of sales in our existing international markets, is subject to risks associated with international operations. These include complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, adapting to local customs and culture, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets, political instability and terrorist attacks, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, currency risks and general economic conditions in specific countries and markets. Any one of\nthese or similar factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and current business practices.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with services in connection with the administration of certain aspects of our business.\nWe have entered into agreements with third party service providers, both domestic and overseas, to provide processing and administrative functions over a broad range of areas, and we may continue to do so in the future. These areas include finance and accounting, information technology, human resources, buying/sourcing, distribution functions, and e-commerce. Services provided by third parties could be interrupted as a result of many factors, including contract disputes. Any failure by third parties to provide us with these services on a timely basis or within our service level expectations and performance standards could result in a disruption of our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, to the extent we are unable to maintain these arrangements, we would incur substantial costs, including costs associated with hiring new employees, in order to return these services in-house or to transition the services to other third parties.\nOur ability to utilize all or a portion of our US deferred tax assets may be limited significantly if we experience an \"ownership change.\"\nAs of January 3, 2015, we had US deferred tax assets of approximately $456.3 million, which include net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards and other items which could be considered net unrealized built in losses (\"NUBIL\"). Among other factors, our ability to utilize our NOL and/or our NUBIL items to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if we experience an \"ownership change\" as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of our stock by \"5-percent shareholders\" (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. The limitation arising from an \"ownership change\" under section 382 of the Code on our ability to utilize our US deferred tax assets depends on the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change. We continue to monitor changes in our ownership and do not believe we had a change in control as of January 3, 2015. If all or a portion of our deferred tax assets are subject to limitation because we experience an ownership change, depending on the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change, our future cash flows could be adversely impacted due to increased tax liability. As of January 3, 2015, substantially all of the tax benefits of our US deferred tax assets had been offset with a full valuation allowance that was recognized in our financial statements.\nThe outcome of current and future litigations and other proceedings in which we are involved may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nWe are a party to several litigations and other proceedings and claims which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. We may in the future become party to other claims and legal actions which, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. In addition, any of the current or possible future legal proceedings in which we may be involved could require significant management and financial resources, which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business.", "PERMNO": 49905, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "KATE"}
