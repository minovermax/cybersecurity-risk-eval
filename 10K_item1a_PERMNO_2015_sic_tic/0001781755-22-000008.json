RISK FACTORS\nSummary Risk Factors\nSome of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, include the following:\n\u2022The continued adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and an indeterminate recovery period could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Macroeconomic conditions, political events, other market conditions in the U.S. and around the world and a decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.\n\u2022Quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations.\n\u2022Conditions impacting our Insurance Company Partners or other parties with whom we do business may impact us.\n\u2022Competition in our industry is intense and, if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose Clients and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\n\u2022Our inability to retain or hire qualified Colleagues, as well as the loss of any of our executive officers or senior leaders, could negatively impact our reputation and/or ability to retain existing business and generate new business.\n\u2022If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our Clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the application of technology and related tools, our results of operations, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire Partners or integrate Partners into our company, and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our Partnerships that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to effectively operate our business.\n\u2022Our business had historically been highly concentrated in the Southeastern United States. While we still maintain a concentration in the Southeastern United States, our rapid growth has resulted in our having several regional concentrations of our business, such that adverse economic conditions, natural disasters, loss trends or regulatory changes in one of these region could adversely affect our financial condition.\n\u2022We derive a significant portion of our commissions and fees from a limited number of our Insurance Company Partners, the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share.\n\u2022We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations, enabling our provision of services to our Clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.\n\u2022Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture, or if we experience a change in management, management philosophy or business strategy, our business may be harmed.\n\u2022Non-compliance with or changes in laws, regulations or licensing requirements applicable to us could restrict our ability to conduct our business and/or could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Regulations affecting Insurance Company Partners with which we place insurance affect how we conduct our operations.\n\u2022Our business is subject to risks related to legal proceedings, regulatory investigations, and governmental inquiries and actions.\n\u2022E&O claims against us, and other incidents, claims, risks, exposures and/or liabilities that require us to make claims against our insurance policies, may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information, whether due to human error, misuse of information by Colleagues, contractors, vendors, or third party bad actors, or as a result of cyberattacks or other security incidents with respect to our or our vendors\u2019 systems, tools, information, processes or services, or failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, industry standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy, security and/or cybersecurity, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal and financial liability, reputational harm, lost revenue, and remediation costs, and could have an adverse effect on our business and/or operations.\n\u2022Our business depends on information processing systems. Data breaches or other security incidents with respect to our or our vendors\u2019 information processing systems may hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We are a holding company with our principal asset being our 51% ownership interest in BRP; accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from BRP to pay dividends, if any, and taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and pay other expenses.\n\u2022In certain circumstances, BRP will be required to make distributions to us and the other holders of LLC Units, and the distributions that BRP will be required to make may be substantial.\n\u2022We will be required to pay BRP\u2019s LLC Members and any other persons that become parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may receive, and the amounts we may pay could be significant.\n\u2022We may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in the future, which could cause dilution to investors and otherwise adversely affect our stock price.\n\u2022We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nRisks Relating to our Business Operations and Industry\nThe continued adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and an indeterminate recovery period could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (including the emergence and spread of new variants) has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption and continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments in the United States, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including:\n\u2022the continued geographic spread and severity of COVID-19, as well as new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and its variants;\n\u2022the duration and scope of the pandemic;\n\u2022the emergence of new virus variants that are more contagious or harmful than prior variants;\n\u2022business closures, travel restrictions, social distancing and other governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken to contain and treat COVID-19;\n\u2022the availability, effectiveness and utilization of vaccines and medications to contain and treat the virus;\n\u2022the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response;\n\u2022the resumption of widespread economic activity;\n\u2022the ability of our Clients to pay their insurance premiums which could impact our commission and fee revenues for our services;\n\u2022the nature and extent of possible claims that might impact the ability of underwriting enterprises to pay supplemental and contingent commissions;\n\u2022any increase in the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us, and other incidents, claims, risks, exposures, and/or liabilities that require us to make claims against our insurance policies;\n\u2022any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions; and\n\u2022any failures of third parties upon which we rely to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to meet those obligations in a timely manner, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic is sustained globally, we may continue to experience disruptions to our business, including:\n\u2022our Clients choosing to limit purchases of insurance due to declining business conditions, our Clients ceasing their business operations on a temporary or permanent basis, and a reduction in our Client\u2019s insurable exposure units (such as headcount, payroll, properties, market values of their assets, and plant, equipment and other asset utilization levels, among other factors), all of which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and other revenue based on premiums placed;\n\u2022a delay in cash or cash equivalent payments to us from our Clients or Insurance Company Partners due to COVID-19 (including any delays caused by \u201cgrace periods\u201d on the collection of insurance premiums declared or proposed by governmental entities), which could negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition;\n\u2022continued travel restrictions and quarantines, which could hinder our ability to establish relationships or originate new business;\n\u2022a reduction of our ability to generate commission revenues, since certain governmental entities have proposed requiring underwriting enterprises to pay business interruption and workers\u2019 compensation claims for COVID-19 losses despite applicable policy exclusions. Such retroactively expanding business interruption or other coverages could materially affect our Insurance Company Partners, reduce the availability of insurance coverage, and negatively affect our ability to generate commission revenues from such policies as well as supplemental and contingent commissions from Insurance Company Partners; and\n\u2022continued alternative working arrangements, including Colleagues working in remote or hybrid environments, which could negatively impact our business should such arrangements remain for an extended period of time.\nWe cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our Clients, Insurance Company Partners, suppliers or other third- party contractors, and any material effect on these parties or their financial condition, could adversely impact us.\nIn addition, if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit, equity, capital or financial markets, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms, or at all, continue to meet our liquidity needs and repay our outstanding indebtedness and comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThese and other developments and disruptions related to COVID-19 could contribute to and, in some cases, magnify the risks enumerated above and below and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, as the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the potential impacts to our risk factors remain uncertain. Additionally, any potential effects of COVID-19 may lag behind the developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMacroeconomic conditions, political events, other market conditions in the U.S. and around the world and a decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMacroeconomic conditions, political events and other market conditions in the U.S. and around the world, including the recent resurgence of inflation and expected interest rate increases, affect the financial services industry. These conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing for those services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in macroeconomic and political conditions, such as the impact from COVID-19 and rising inflation and interest rates could also shift demand to services for which we do not have a competitive advantage, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Any changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars,\u201d which could affect volume of economic activity in the U.S., including demand for our services.\nFor example, the demand for insurance policies may be depressed by higher levels of inflation. In addition, a significant portion of our operating expenses goes to employee compensation and benefits, which are sensitive to inflation. To maintain our ability to successfully compete for the best talent, rising inflation rates may require us to provide compensation increases beyond historical increases, which may significantly increase our compensation costs. Consequently, inflation is expected to increase our operating expenses over time and may adversely impact our results of operating cash flow.\nMoreover, we have various agreements to lease office space located in 20 states throughout the U.S. and part of such leases contain effective annual rent escalations either fixed or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index. During higher inflationary periods, our rent expenses may increase significantly, which may adversely affect to our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFurthermore, during inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased, which would have a direct effect on the interest expense in case we decide to refinance our existing long-term borrowings, in particular the JPM Credit Agreement, or incur in any additional indebtedness.\nIn addition to macroeconomic conditions, political events and other market conditions, other factors such as business commissions and fees, microeconomic conditions, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, can affect our business and economic environment. The demand for insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Middle Market, MainStreet, Medicare and Specialty Operating Groups. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premiums charged by our Insurance Company Partners to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect our business as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our Clients. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of Clients by hampering our ability to place insurance business. Also, some of our Clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, or any segment or sub-segment of the economy, which could have an adverse effect on our collectability of receivables. Errors and omissions claims against us, which we refer to as E&O claims, may increase in economic downturns, adversely affecting our brokerage business. In addition, other incidents, claims, risks, exposures and/or liabilities that require us to make claims against our own policies of insurance may have a similar effect. Also, the volatility or decline of economic or other market conditions could result in the increased surrender of insurance products or cause individuals to forgo insurance, thereby impacting our contingent commissions, which are primarily driven by our Insurance Company Partners\u2019 growth and profitability metrics. A decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVolatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.\nWe derive most of our commissions and fees from our brokerage and related services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. Because of market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage commissions and fees and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time. In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets, including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. Our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than a percentage of premium. This could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and might not increase with premiums as commissions do or with the level of service provided.\nAs traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium commissions and fees to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance brokers or agents. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to precisely forecast our commission and contingent commissions and fees, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in commissions and fees, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the commissions and fees we earn on the sale of certain insurance products is based on premiums and commission rates set by our Insurance Company Partners, any decreases in these premiums or commission rates, or actions by our Insurance Company Partners seeking repayment of commissions, could result in commissions and fees decreases or expenses to us.\nWe derive commissions and fees from the sale of insurance products that are paid by our Insurance Company Partners from whom our Clients purchase insurance. Because payments for the sale of insurance products are processed internally by our Insurance Company Partners, we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected in any particular period until after the end of that period, which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures. Additionally, our Insurance Company Partners or their affiliates may, under certain circumstances, seek the chargeback or repayment of commissions as a result of policy lapse, surrender, cancellation, rescission, default or upon other specified circumstances. As a result of the chargeback or repayment of commissions, we may incur an expense in a particular period related to commissions and fees previously recognized in a prior period and reflected in our financial statements. Such an expense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the expense is greater than the amount of related commissions and fees retained by us.\nThe commission rates are set by our Insurance Company Partners and are based on the premiums that the Insurance Company Partners charge. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the insurance market. In addition, the insurance industry has been characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity and periods of favorable premium levels due to shortages of capacity. Capacity could also be reduced by our Insurance Company Partners\u2019 failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages and/or geographic areas that we offer our Clients. Commission rates and premiums can change based on prevailing legislative, economic and competitive factors that affect our Insurance Company Partners. These factors, which are not within our control, include the capacity of our Insurance Company Partners to place new business, underwriting and non-underwriting profits of our Insurance Company Partners, consumer demand for insurance products, the availability of comparable products from other insurance companies at a lower cost and the availability of alternative insurance products, such as government benefits and self-insurance products, to consumers. We cannot predict the timing or extent of future changes in commission rates or premiums or the effect any of these changes will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nQuarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations.\nOur commission income (including profit-sharing contingent commissions and override commissions) can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production. We do not control the factors that cause these variations. Specifically, Clients\u2019 demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals, new business and lost business (which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations). In addition, we rely on our Insurance Company Partners for the payment of certain commissions. Quarterly and annual fluctuations in commissions and fees based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of new business, policy renewals and payments from our Insurance Company Partners may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProfit-sharing contingent commissions are special revenue-sharing override commissions paid by our Insurance Company Partners based on the attainment of certain metrics such as the profitability, volume or growth of the business placed with such companies generally during the prior year. These are not guaranteed payments and our Insurance Company Partners may change the calculations or potentially elect to stop paying them at all on an annual basis. Over the last two years these commissions generally have been in the range of 7.5% to 9.5% of our current year\u2019s total core commissions and fees. Increases in loss ratios experienced by our Insurance Company Partners will result in a decreased profit to them and may result in decreases in payments of contingent or profit-sharing commissions to us. Due to, among other things, potentially poor macroeconomic conditions, the inherent uncertainty of loss in our Clients\u2019 industries and changes in underwriting criteria (including profitability, volume or growth thresholds), due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by our Insurance Company Partners, we cannot predict the payment of these profit-sharing contingent commissions. Further, we have no control over the ability of our Insurance Company Partners to estimate loss reserves, which affects our ability to make profit-sharing calculations. Override commissions are paid by our Insurance Company Partners based on the attainment of certain metrics such as the profitability, volume or growth of the business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year or in the beginning of the following year. Because profit-sharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our commissions and fees, any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect our results of operations, profitability and our financial condition.\nSee \u201c-Our business had historically been highly concentrated in the Southeastern United States. While we still maintain a concentration in the Southeastern United States, our rapid growth has resulted in our having several regional concentrations of our business, such that adverse economic conditions, natural disasters, loss trends or regulatory changes in one of these regions could adversely affect our financial condition.\u201d\nConditions impacting our Insurance Company Partners or other parties with whom we do business may impact us.\nWe have a significant amount of accounts receivable from our Insurance Company Partners with whom we place insurance. If those Insurance Company Partners were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The potential for one of our Insurance Company Partners to cease writing insurance we offer our Clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry, which in turn could have the effect of reduced placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduced commissions and fees and profitability for us. Questions about one of our Insurance Company Partners\u2019 perceived stability or financial strength may contribute to such Insurance Company Partners\u2019 strategic decisions to focus on certain lines of insurance to the detriment of others. The failure of an Insurance Company Partner with whom we place insurance could result in E&O claims against us by our Clients, and the failure of our Insurance Company Partners could make the E&O insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable, which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any of our Insurance Company Partners merge or if one of our large Insurance Company Partners fails or withdraws from certain geographic areas or from offering certain lines of insurance, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of insurance and, as a result, reduce our commissions and fees and profitability. Such failures or insurance withdrawals on the part of our Insurance Company Partners could occur for any number of reasons, including large unexpected payouts related to climate events or other emerging risk areas.\nCompetition in our industry is intense and, if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose Clients and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nThe business of providing insurance products and services is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify. We compete for Clients on the basis of reputation, Client service, program and product offerings and our ability to tailor products and services to meet the specific needs of a Client.\nWe actively compete with numerous integrated financial services organizations as well as Insurance Company Partners and brokers, producer groups, individual insurance agents, investment management firms, independent financial planners and broker-dealers. Competition may reduce the fees that we can obtain for services provided, which would have an adverse effect on commissions and fees and margins. Many of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and may be able to offer products and services that we do not currently offer and may not offer in the future. To the extent that banks, securities firms, insurance companies\u2019 affiliates and the financial services industry may experience further consolidation (such as the acquisition by Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. of substantially all of the treaty reinsurance brokerage operations from Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company), we may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry, as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly, and aggressively, offer a wider variety of financial services, including insurance intermediary services. In addition, a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to brokers or other market intermediaries. Furthermore, we compete with various other companies that provide risk-related services or alternatives to traditional insurance services, including Insurtech start-up companies, which are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence (AI), digital platforms, data analytics, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve the Client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate. In addition, in recent years, private equity sponsors have invested tens of billions of dollars into the insurance sector, transforming existing players and creating new ones to compete with large brokers. These new competitors, alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share, and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop. With respect to our sale of Medicare-related insurance, we also compete with government-run health insurance exchanges. The federal government operates a website where Medicare beneficiaries can purchase Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans or be referred to carriers to purchase Medicare Supplement plans. We also compete with the original Medicare program. The Affordable Care Act exchanges have websites where individuals and small businesses can purchase health insurance, and they also have offline customer support and enrollment capabilities.\nCompetitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster, or price their services more aggressively. They may also compete for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions, fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do. To respond to increased competition and pricing pressure, we may have to lower the cost of our services or decrease the level of services provided to Clients, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In the event that any of such competitors initiates litigation against us, such litigation, even if without merit, could be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:\n\u2022increased capital-raising by insurance companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions;\n\u2022insurance companies selling insurance directly to the insured without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;\n\u2022changes in our business compensation model as a result of legal, policy and/or regulatory developments;\n\u2022federal and state governments establishing programs to provide property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance companies;\n\u2022climate-change regulation in the U.S. and around the world moving us toward a low-carbon economy, which could create new competitive pressures around innovative insurance solutions; and\n\u2022increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and Internet or other technology firms offering risk management, insurance brokerage services or new distribution channels for insurance, such as payroll firms.\nNew competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to retain or hire qualified Colleagues, as well as the loss of any of our executive officers or senior leaders, could negatively impact our reputation and/or ability to retain existing business and generate new business.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel. There is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees, especially in key positions. Our competitors may be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities than we can. Any new personnel we hire may not be or become as productive as we expect, as we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. Our effort to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability. We can make no assurances that qualified Colleagues will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate our Colleagues, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new Colleagues, or inadequate resources to train, integrate, and retain qualified Colleagues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some of our Clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services. Certain of our key personnel are prohibited by contract from soliciting our Colleagues and Clients and from competing in our industry in any state in which we conduct or actively plan to conduct business at the time of the employee\u2019s termination for a period of up to five years following termination of employment with us. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these contracts.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders, including our founders and key executives, or if one or more of them contracts COVID-19, or is the victim of any accident, injury, illness or other ailment. In particular, our future success depends substantially on the continued service of our co-founder and Chairman, Lowry Baldwin, and our Chief Executive Officer, Trevor Baldwin. Although we operate with a decentralized management system, the loss of our senior managers or other key personnel (including the legacy management of certain joint ventures or acquired subsidiaries) in any circumstance, including any limitation on the performance of their duties or short- or long-term absence as a result of COVID-19, or any accident, injury, illness or other ailment, or our inability to continue to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices, and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, protest or riot, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of personnel, office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing backup systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges in particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose key executives, personnel, client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to Clients in a disaster recovery scenario. We may experience additional disruption due to system upgrades, outages, an increase in remote work or other impacts as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships, or legal liability. Our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate, or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms.\nIf we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our Clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the application of technology and related tools, our results of operations, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of, and the opportunity presented by, digital disruption and other technology change. These may include new applications or insurance-related services based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, blockchain or new approaches to data mining. We may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants (for example, through disintermediation) or new entrants such as technology companies, Insurtech start-up companies and others. We must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business may require us to incur significant expenses. Our technological development projects may also not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses. If we cannot develop or implement new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, client relationships, growth and compliance programs.\nDamage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur reputation is one of our key assets. We advise our Clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain Clients depends greatly on the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. If a Client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability or lose the Client relationship altogether, which may negatively impact other Clients\u2019 perception regarding us. Our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential Colleagues, investors, Insurance Company Partners, vendors, regulators and the communities in which we operate. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these or other matters, including our association with Clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation, or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our Colleagues, could damage our reputation. Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, Clients and our Colleagues with respect to our environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nThere is increased focus, including from governmental organizations, investors, employees and Clients, on ESG issues such as environmental stewardship, climate change, diversity and inclusion, pay equity, racial justice, workplace conduct and cybersecurity and data privacy. There can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will successfully meet society\u2019s expectations as to our proper role. Negative public perception, adverse publicity or negative comments in social media, including as a result of actions taken by companies we acquire before the acquisition, could damage our reputation, or harm our relationships with investors, other stakeholders, regulators and the communities in which we operate, if we do not, or are not perceived to, adequately address these issues. Any harm to our reputation could impact Colleague engagement and retention and the willingness of Clients and Insurance Company Partners to do business with us.\nA variety of organizations have developed ratings to measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. Investments in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures to their investment decisions. Unfavorable ratings of BRP Group or our industry, as well as omission of inclusion of our stock into ESG-oriented investment funds may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price.\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, landslides, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, hailstorms, explosions, climate events or weather patterns and public health crises, illness, epidemics or pandemic health events, as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, military actions, cyber-terrorism, explosions and biological, chemical or radiological events. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity of our Insurance Company Partners, making it more difficult for our Colleagues and contracted agents to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our ordinary business operations. Any increases in loss ratios due to natural or man-made disasters could impact our contingent commissions, which are primarily driven by both growth and profitability metrics.\nA natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us, or other incidents, claims, risks, exposures and/or liabilities that require us to make claims against our insurance policies.\nSee \u201c-Our business had historically been highly concentrated in the Southeastern United States. While we still maintain a concentration in the Southeastern United States, our rapid growth has resulted in our having several regional concentrations of our business, such that adverse economic conditions, natural disasters, loss trends or regulatory changes in one of these regions could adversely affect our financial condition.\u201d See also \u201c-The continued adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and an indeterminate recovery period could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nIf our ability to enroll individuals during enrollment periods is impeded, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nIt is difficult for the health insurance Risk Advisors we employ and our systems and processes to handle the increased volume of health insurance transactions that occur in a short period of time during the healthcare reform annual open enrollment period and the Medicare annual enrollment period. We hire additional Colleagues on a temporary or seasonal basis in a limited period of time to address the expected increase in the volume of health insurance transactions during the Medicare annual enrollment period. We must ensure that our health insurance Risk Advisors and those of outsourced call centers are timely licensed, trained and certified and have the appropriate authority to sell health insurance in a number of states and for a number of different health insurance companies. We depend on our own Colleagues, state departments of insurance, government exchanges and Insurance Company Partners for licensing, certification and appointment. If our ability to market and sell Medicare-related health insurance and individual and family health insurance is constrained during an enrollment period for any reason, such as technology failures, reduced allocation of resources, any inability to timely employ, license, train, certify and retain our Colleagues and our contractors and their health insurance Risk Advisors to sell health insurance, interruptions in the operation of our website or systems or issues with government-run health insurance exchanges, we could acquire fewer members, suffer a reduction in our membership and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify and acquire Partners or integrate Partners into our company, and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our Partnerships that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nStrategic acquisitions to complement and further expand our business, which we refer to as Partnerships, have been and will likely remain an important part of our competitive strategy. If we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any Partner into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. The process of integrating a Partner has created, and will continue to create, operating difficulties. The risks we face include:\n\u2022diversion of management time and focus from operating our core business to acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022excessive costs of deploying our business support and financial management tools in acquired companies;\n\u2022delays in the successful integration of the Partner into our operations;\n\u2022failure to successfully integrate the Partner into our operations, including cultural challenges associated with integrating and retaining Colleagues;\n\u2022failure to achieve anticipated efficiencies or benefits, including through the loss of key Clients or personnel of the Partner;\n\u2022failure to realize our strategic objectives for the Partner or further develop the Partner; and\n\u2022the consequences of the conduct of our acquired companies prior to their acquisition by us, including the occurrence of data breaches or other cybersecurity attacks during the integration of information systems, as well as increased costs associated with implementing state and regulatory compliance procedures, including data privacy and cybersecurity protections.\nFurthermore, when regulatory approval of our proposed Partnerships is required, our ability to complete such Partnerships may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator.\nAlthough we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our Partnerships, there may be liabilities that we fail to discover, that we inadequately assess or that are not properly disclosed to us. In particular, to the extent that any Partner (i) failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations, (ii) failed to fulfill contractual obligations to Clients, Insurance Company Partners or other third parties such as vendors, service providers or contracted agents, or (iii) incurred material liabilities or obligations to Clients that are not identified during the diligence process, we, as the successor owner, may be financially responsible for these violations, failures and liabilities and may suffer financial or reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected. In addition, as part of a Partnership, we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the Partner pursuant to the terms and conditions of agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require. We also may be subject to litigation or other claims in connection with a Partner, including claims from Colleagues, Clients, stockholders or other third parties. Any material liabilities we incur that are associated with our Partnerships could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Partnership strategy is also affected by our ability to secure additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain such additional financing or, if available, it may not be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. We cannot predict or guarantee that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, consummate any Partnership or integrate any Partner. Any failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSee Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Partnerships\u201d for further discussion of our strategic acquisitions.\nThe provision of advisory services to clients with respect to captive insurance, and specifically, utilization of an 831(b) election, is subject to numerous, complex and frequently changing laws, regulations and governmental interpretations of the same, and non-compliance or changes in laws and regulations or governmental interpretations of the same, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have an advisory services business that assists certain clients with establishment of captive insurance companies, for their own purposes, which leverage the benefits of Section 831(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and which are subject to audit and oversight from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). The IRS has conducted investigations, and may be conducting investigations, of certain peers of ours that also provide similar services, with respect to whether or not such third parties are acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with those operations. We have no reason to believe that we have been or are currently a target of any such investigation. If the IRS were to disallow 831(b) elections, modify its guidance around 831(b) elections, or otherwise investigate our business and conclude that we are a tax shelter promoter, such actions, whether or not merited, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhen we acquire Partners we record goodwill and other intangible assets. As of December 31, 2021, goodwill represented 43% of our total assets. Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to assessment for impairment at least annually. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting units. We compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill. Management reviews the carrying value attributed to each reporting unit at least annually to determine if the facts and circumstances suggest that there is impairment.\nWe may in the future be required to take additional goodwill or other asset impairment charges. Any such non-cash charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies, we face risks associated with the entry into new lines of business and the growth and development of these businesses.\nFrom time to time, either through Partnerships or internal development, we may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. These new lines of business or new products and services may present additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will not be successful; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services, or that we are unable to retain Clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new lines of business, integrating the Partner into our systems and culture, recruiting professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition-related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.\nWe have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to effectively operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $858.1 million, collateralized by substantially all the Company\u2019s assets, including a pledge of all equity securities of each of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. During the year ending December 31, 2021, we had debt servicing costs of $48.2 million, inclusive of $5.6 million in principal repayments and $26.9 million of interest.\nThe level of debt we have outstanding during any period could adversely affect our financial flexibility. We also bear risk at the time debt matures. Our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, such as an environment of rising interest rates. The need to service our indebtedness will also reduce our ability to use cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to stockholders, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and general corporate purposes. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on favorable terms, or at all. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe JPM Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to make certain restricted payments, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make certain investments and require us to comply with certain financial covenants. The restrictions in the JPM Credit Agreement governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. A failure to comply with the restrictions under the JPM Credit Agreement could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe JPM Credit Agreement provides for an interest rate based on, depending on the type of loan, the Eurodollar rate or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement), plus, in each case, a margin based on Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement). Under existing guidance, the publication of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) was to be discontinued beginning on or around the end of 2021. However, the ICE Benchmark Administration, in its capacity as administrator of USD LIBOR, announced that it extended publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR (other than one-week and two-month tenors) by 18 months to June 2023. The uncertainty regarding the transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our available debt that currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark rate, and ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness, which may affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the JPM Credit Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the JPM Credit Agreement, we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, in the future. This could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures and execute on our Partnership strategy, expose us to the risk of increased interest rates and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks that we face could be increased, and we may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations. Furthermore, the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants, which could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends.\nOur business had historically been highly concentrated in the Southeastern United States. While we still maintain a concentration in the Southeastern United States, our rapid growth has resulted in our having several regional concentrations of our business, such that adverse economic conditions, natural disasters, loss trends or regulatory changes in one of these regions could adversely affect our financial condition.\nA significant portion of our business remains concentrated in the Southeastern U.S., with several other regional concentrations. The insurance business is primarily a state-regulated industry, and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry. Because our business is concentrated in several regions of the U.S., we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those regions than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states. In addition, the occurrence of adverse economic conditions, natural or other disasters, loss trends or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, Florida homeowners recently have been assigning the benefit of their insurance recovery to third parties. This practice, referred to as an \u201cassignment of benefits\u201d or \u201cAOB,\u201d and related abuses have substantially increased, and may continue to increase, our Insurance Company Partners\u2019 exposure to inflated claims, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Increases in loss ratios and related costs experienced by our Insurance Company Partners will result in a decreased profit to them and may result in decreases in payments of contingent or profit-sharing commissions to us. This trend may also cause one or more of our Insurance Company Partners to reduce or cease writing insurance we offer our Clients, whether in part, entirely or on a geographic basis, which in turn could reduce our ability to place certain lines of insurance and, as a result, reduce our commissions and fees and profitability.\nIn addition, we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes (particularly in Florida, where our headquarters and numerous offices are located), earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, fire, extreme weather conditions, geopolitical events, such as terrorist acts, and other natural or man-made disasters. Hurricanes in particular may have an outsized impact on the insurance industry. We expect to continue to grow our footprint throughout the country.\nWe derive a significant portion of our commissions and fees from a limited number of our Insurance Company Partners, the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, one Insurance Company Partner accounted for an aggregate of approximately 8% of our total core commissions. Should this Insurance Company Partner seek to terminate its arrangements with us or in the case of material financial impairment of such Insurance Company Partner, we could be forced to move our business to another Insurance Company Partner and additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result.\nOur business may be harmed if we lose our relationships with Insurance Company Partners, fail to maintain good relationships with Insurance Company Partners, become dependent upon a limited number of Insurance Company Partners or fail to develop new Insurance Company Partner relationships.\nOur business typically enters into contractual agency relationships with Insurance Company Partners that are sometimes unique to BRP Group, but nonexclusive and terminable on short notice by either party for any reason. In many cases, Insurance Company Partners also have the ability to amend the terms of our agreements unilaterally, including commission rates on short notice. Our Insurance Company Partners may be unwilling to allow us to sell their existing or new insurance products or may amend our agreements with them, for a variety of reasons, including for competitive or regulatory reasons or because of a reluctance to distribute their products through our platform. Our Insurance Company Partners may decide to rely on their own internal distribution channels, choose to exclude us from their most profitable or popular products, or decide not to distribute insurance products in individual markets in certain geographies or altogether. The termination or amendment of our relationship with an Insurance Company Partner could reduce the variety of insurance products we offer. We also could lose a source of, or be paid reduced commissions for, future sales and could lose renewal commissions for past sales. Our business could also be harmed if we fail to develop new Insurance Company Partner relationships.\nIn the future, it may become necessary for us to offer insurance products from a reduced number of Insurance Company Partners or to derive a greater portion of our commissions and fees from a more concentrated number of Insurance Company Partners as our business and the insurance industry evolve. Should our dependence on a smaller number of Insurance Company Partners increase, whether as a result of the termination of Insurance Company Partner relationships, Insurance Company Partner consolidation or otherwise, we may become more vulnerable to adverse changes in our relationships with our Insurance Company Partners, particularly in states where we offer insurance products from a relatively small number of Insurance Company Partners or where a small number of insurance companies dominate the market. The termination, amendment or consolidation of our relationship with our Insurance Company Partners could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations, enabling our provision of services to our Clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.\nWe rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data, and information, such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing and administration and support functions, that are critical to our business operations. These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, benefits administrators, software and system vendors, health plan providers, investment managers and providers of human resources, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delays and expenses. While we generally perform cybersecurity diligence on our key vendors, because we do not control our vendors and our ability to monitor their cybersecurity is limited, we cannot ensure the cybersecurity measures they take will be sufficient to protect any information we share with them or to which they may have access. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for security breaches, cyberattacks or other similar incidents attributed to our vendors as they relate to the information we share with them or to which we grant them access. A failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high-quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we face risks as we transition from in-house functions to third-party support functions and providers, or vice versa, that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations. These third parties face their own technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential Client, Colleague, consumer, or Company information, could cause harm to our reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, data breaches or other cybersecurity incidents, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory fines or penalties, liability claims from Clients, or Colleagues, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth. As our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and, if achieved, maintain profitability.\nWe have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods. In future periods, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth consistent with recent history, or at all. We believe our revenue growth depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022attract new Clients, successfully deploy and implement our products, obtain Client renewals and provide our Clients with excellent Client support;\n\u2022increase our network of Insurance Company Partners and the profit-sharing, override and/or contingent commissions that we earn from such Insurance Company Partners;\n\u2022adequately expand, train, integrate and retain our Colleagues, including our executive officers and senior leaders, and maintain or increase our sales force\u2019s productivity;\n\u2022improve our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely and accurate reporting of our operational and financial results;\n\u2022successfully introduce new products and enhance existing products;\n\u2022successfully deploy information technology assets for use by our Colleagues and interaction with our Clients and Insurance Company Partners;\n\u2022adapt to the ever-changing regulatory and legal landscape;\n\u2022protect sensitive, personal and confidential information and data within BRP\u2019s custody from third party bad actors;\n\u2022successfully identify and acquire new Partners;\n\u2022successfully integrate Partnerships into the Company in an operationally efficient manner;\n\u2022service our existing indebtedness;\n\u2022access the capital markets or otherwise obtain access to capital to satisfy future needs of the Company;\n\u2022successfully introduce our products to new markets and geographies; and\n\u2022successfully compete against larger companies and new market entrants.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives and, in particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty may impact our ability to successfully accomplish any of the above, and as a result, it is difficult for us to forecast our future results of operations. Our historical growth rate should not be considered indicative of our future performance and may decline in the future. In future periods, our revenue could grow more slowly than in recent periods or decline for any number of reasons, including those outlined above. If our revenue or revenue growth rates decline, investors\u2019 perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the market price of common stock could decline.\nIf we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have experienced rapid growth. This growth has placed significant demands on management and our operational infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new Colleagues, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our Company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our services and efficiency of our operations could suffer and we may not be able to execute on our business plan, which could harm our brand, results of operations and overall business.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture, or if we experience a change in management, management philosophy or business strategy, our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a significant contributor to our success has been our entrepreneurial and sales-oriented culture, as outlined in the Azimuth, our corporate constitution. As we grow, including from the integration of Colleagues and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future Partnerships, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our profitability or our ability to retain and recruit people of the highest integrity and quality who are essential to our future success. We may face pressure to change our culture as we grow, particularly if we experience difficulties in attracting competent personnel who are willing to embrace our culture. In addition, as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures, or if we experience a change in management, management philosophy or business strategy, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture, such as our Partnership operating model, which could negatively impact our future success.\nOur results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.\nIn the past, state regulators have scrutinized the manner in which insurance brokers are compensated. For example, the Attorney General of the State of New York brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community. These actions have created uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices, and the transparency and discourse to Clients regarding brokers\u2019 compensation, it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future. If they do so, compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business.\nCertain of our results of operations and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality.\nWe have presented, and may continue to present, certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, in filings with the SEC and other public statements. Any failure to accurately report and present our non-GAAP financial measures could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nThe insurance brokerage market is seasonal and our results of operations are somewhat affected by seasonal trends. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins are typically highest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. This variation is primarily due to fluctuations in our revenue, while overhead remains consistent throughout the year. Our revenues are generally highest in the first quarter due to the impact of contingent commission payments received in the first quarter from Insurance Company Partners that we cannot readily estimate before receipt without the risk of significant reversal and a higher degree of first quarter policy commencements and renewals in Medicare and certain Middle Market lines of business such as employee benefits and commercial. In addition, a higher proportion of our first quarter revenue is derived from our highest margin businesses.\nPartnerships can significantly impact Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins in a given year and may increase the amount of seasonality within the business, especially results attributable to Partnerships that have not been fully integrated into our business or owned by us for a full year.\nClimate risks, including the risk of an economic crisis, risks associated with the physical effects of climate events, and risks associated with governmental responses to climate risks, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe effects of climate events continue to create an alarming level of concern. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to address climate and climate-related events. If new legislation or regulation is enacted, we could incur increased costs and capital expenditures to comply with its limitations, which may impact our financial condition and operating performance.\nIn addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve recently identified the climate as a systemic risk to the economy. It also reported that a gradual change in investor sentiment regarding climate risk introduces the possibility of abrupt tipping points or significant swings in sentiment, which could create unpredictable follow-on effects in financial markets. If this occurred, not only would we be negatively impacted by the general economic decline, but a drop in the stock market affecting our stock price could negatively impact our ability to grow through mergers and acquisitions financed using our common stock.\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy could harm specific industries or sectors such as oil and gas in ways that could impact our business. Our Clients in certain industries may be more adversely affected by climate events and could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurance-related services, which could adversely impact our revenues. Negative publicity arising from our association with Clients in disfavored businesses or industries, or the perception that we are not sufficiently focused on climate risks, could damage our reputation with investors, Clients, Colleagues and regulators. In addition, the transition to a low-carbon economy could give rise to the need for innovative insurance and risk management solutions for entirely new industries and companies, as well as advice and services to bolster climate resilience for existing companies. If we fail to innovate in response to these changes, we could lose market share to our competitors or new market entrants that do.\nMoreover, if our Insurance Company Partners fail or withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage because of large payouts related to climate events, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability.\nFurthermore, climate events may pose physical risks to our business, such as the frequency and intensity of unfavorable weather conditions, such as fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, drought, water shortages, rainfall, unseasonably warm. Overall, climate events, their effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters\nNon-compliance with or changes in laws, regulations or licensing requirements applicable to us could restrict our ability to conduct our business and/or could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe industry in which we operate is subject to extensive regulation. We are subject to regulation and supervision both federally and in each applicable local jurisdiction. In general, these regulations are designed to protect Clients and the insured and to protect the integrity of the financial markets, rather than to protect stockholders or creditors. Our ability to conduct business in these jurisdictions depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements, or changes in regulatory requirements or interpretations, could result in actions by regulators, potentially leading to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt effectively to any changes in law. Furthermore, in some areas of our businesses, we act on the basis of our own or the industry's interpretations of applicable laws or regulations, which may conflict from state to state. In the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities, we may be penalized. In extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary\u2019s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions could result from failure to comply with regulatory requirements. Due to the complexity, periodic modification and differing interpretations of state insurance laws and regulations, we may not have always been, and we may not always be, in compliance with them. In addition, we could face lawsuits by Clients, the insured and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws and regulations. It is difficult to predict whether changes resulting from new laws and regulations, as well as changes in interpretation of current laws and regulations, will affect the industry or our business and, if so, to what degree.\nColleagues and principals who engage in the solicitation, negotiation or sale of insurance, or provide certain other insurance services, generally are required to be licensed individually. Insurance and laws and regulations govern whether licensees may share commissions with unlicensed entities and individuals. We believe that any payments we make to third parties are in compliance with applicable laws. However, should any regulatory agency take a contrary position and prevail, we will be required to change the manner in which we pay fees to such Colleagues or principals or require entities receiving such payments to become registered or licensed.\nState insurance laws grant supervisory agencies, including state departments of insurance, departments of financials services, and similar regulatory authorities, broad administrative authority. State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners continually review existing laws and regulations, some of which affect our business. These supervisory agencies regulate many aspects of the insurance business, including, the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and other insurance intermediaries, the handling of third-party funds held in a fiduciary capacity and trade practices, such as marketing, advertising and compensation arrangements entered into by insurance brokers and agents. This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance, and by limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, and the form of compensation we can accept from our Clients, Insurance Company Partners and third parties. Moreover, in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance, states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools, which compete directly, on a subsidized basis, with private insurance providers.\nFederal, state and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have focused on, and continue to devote substantial attention to, the insurance industry as well as to the sale of products or services to seniors. Regulatory review or the issuance of interpretations of existing laws and regulations may result in the enactment of new laws and regulations that could adversely affect our operations or our ability to conduct business profitably. We are unable to predict whether any such laws or regulations will be enacted and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our business.\nOther legislative developments that could adversely affect us include: changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments (for example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers. Also, as climate risk issues become more prevalent, the U.S. is beginning to respond to these issues. This increasing governmental focus on climate risks may result in new environmental regulations that cause us to incur additional compliance costs, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nProposed tort reform legislation, if enacted, could decrease demand for casualty insurance, thereby reducing our commission revenues.\nLegislation concerning tort reform has been considered, from time to time, in the United States Congress and in several state legislatures. Among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards, including punitive damages, and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits. Enactment of these or similar provisions by Congress, or by states in which we sell insurance, could reduce the demand for casualty insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold, thereby reducing our commission revenues.\nRegulations affecting Insurance Company Partners with which we place insurance affect how we conduct our operations.\nOur Insurance Company Partners are also regulated by state departments of insurance for solvency and other issues and are subject to reserve requirements. We cannot guarantee that all Insurance Company Partners with which we do business comply with regulations instituted by state departments of insurance. We may need to expend resources to address questions or concerns regarding our relationships with these Insurance Company Partners, which diverts management resources away from business operations.\nOur business is subject to risks related to legal proceedings, regulatory investigations, and governmental inquiries and actions.\nWe are subject to litigation, regulatory investigations and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business operations. The risks associated with these matters often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. While we have insurance coverage for some of these potential claims, others may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or any ultimate liabilities may exceed our coverage. We may be subject to actions and claims relating to the sale, solicitation and negotiation of insurance, including the suitability of such products and services, as well as denials of coverage from our Insurance Company Partners. Actions and claims may result in the rescission of such sales; consequently, our Insurance Company Partners may seek to recoup commissions paid to us, which may lead to legal action against us. The outcome of such actions cannot be predicted and such claims or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations, as well as regulatory investigations. The insurance industry has been subject to a significant level of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies, including state Attorneys General offices and state departments of insurance, concerning certain practices within the insurance industry. These practices include, without limitation, the receipt of contingent commissions by insurance brokers and agents from insurance companies and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed, the collection of agency fees, which we define as fees separate from commissions charged directly to Clients for efforts performed in the issuance of new insurance policies, bid rigging and related matters. From time to time, our subsidiaries receive informational requests from governmental authorities.\nThere have been a number of revisions to existing, or proposals to modify or enact new, laws and regulations regarding insurance agents and brokers. These actions have imposed or could impose additional obligations on us with respect to our products sold. Some insurance companies have agreed with regulatory authorities to end the payment of contingent commissions on insurance products, which could impact our commissions that are based on the volume, consistency and profitability of business generated by us.\nWe cannot predict the impact that any new laws, rules or regulations may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Given the current regulatory environment and the number of our subsidiaries operating in local markets throughout the country, it is possible that we will become subject to further governmental inquiries and subpoenas and have lawsuits filed against us. Regulators may raise issues during investigations, examinations or audits that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. The interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact. We could also be materially adversely affected by any new industry-wide regulations or practices that may result from these proceedings.\nOur involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to incur additional legal and other costs and, if we were found to have violated any laws, we could be required to pay fines, damages and other costs, perhaps in material amounts. Regardless of final costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on us by exposing us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to client relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources.\nThe marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous, complex and frequently changing laws and regulations, and non-compliance or changes in laws and regulations could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous laws, regulations and guidelines at the federal and state level. The marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are principally regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d). The marketing and sale of Medicare Supplement plans are principally regulated on a state-by-state basis by state departments of insurance. The laws and regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of Medicare plans are numerous, ambiguous and complex, and, particularly with respect to regulations and guidance issued by CMS for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, change frequently. The telephone calls on which we enroll individuals into Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are required to be recorded. Health insurance companies audit these recordings for compliance and listen to them in connection with their investigation of complaints. In addition, Medicare eligible individuals may receive a special election period and the ability to change Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans outside the Medicare annual enrollment period in the event that the sale of the plan was not in accordance with CMS rules and guidelines. Given CMS\u2019s scrutiny of Medicare product health insurance companies and the responsibility of the Insurance Company Partners for actions that we take, Insurance Company Partners may terminate our relationship with them or take other corrective action if our Medicare product sales, marketing and operations are not in compliance or give rise to too many complaints. The termination of our relationship with Insurance Company Partners for this reason would reduce the products we are able to offer, could result in the loss of commissions for past and future sales and would otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the laws, regulations and guidelines relating to the sale of Medicare plans, we have altered, and likely will have to continue to alter, our websites and sales process to comply with several requirements that are not applicable to our sale of non-Medicare-related health insurance plans. For instance, many aspects of our online platforms and our marketing material and processes, as well as changes to these platforms, materials and processes, including call center scripts, must be filed on a regular basis with CMS and reviewed and approved by health insurance companies in light of CMS requirements. In addition, certain aspects of our Medicare plan marketing partner relationships have been in the past, and will be in the future, subjected to CMS and health insurance company review. Changes to the laws, regulations and guidelines relating to Medicare plans, their interpretation or the manner in which they are enforced could be incompatible with these relationships, our platforms or our sale of Medicare plans, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to changes in CMS guidance or enforcement or interpretation of existing guidance applicable to our marketing and sale of Medicare products, or as a result of new laws, regulations and guidelines, CMS, state departments of insurance or Insurance Company Partners may determine to object to or not to approve aspects of our online platforms or marketing material and processes and may determine that certain existing aspects of our Medicare-related business are not in compliance. As a result, the progress of our Medicare operations could be slowed or we could be prevented from operating aspects of our Medicare commissions and fees generating activities altogether, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly if it occurred during the Medicare annual enrollment period.\nWe have received, and may in the future receive, inquiries from CMS or state departments of insurance regarding our marketing and business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. Inquiries and proceedings initiated by the government could adversely impact our health insurance licenses, require us to pay fines, require us to modify marketing and business practices, result in litigation and otherwise harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIn May 2021, CMS changed its process for the submission and approval of marketing materials related to Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. The practical application of the previous process allowed for a lead carrier to handle most of the review and filing of Medicare plan marketing materials with CMS. The new process requires each carrier to approve of each filed marketing material and has resulted in a more complicated and time consuming process to get our marketing material filed with CMS and through the process with carriers. In October 2021, CMS issued new guidance that significantly broadens the types of marketing materials that we are required to file with CMS, including the requirement to file certain generic marketing materials that refer to the benefits or costs of Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D prescription drug plans but that do not specifically mention a health insurance carrier's name or a specific plan. As a result, we now submit to each Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan carrier with which we have a relationship a significantly larger number of marketing materials than we have in the past. We may not be able to use certain of our marketing materials and implement our marketing programs effectively if CMS or an Insurance Company Partner has comments or disapproves of our marketing materials. If we do not timely file the additional marketing materials with CMS, if Insurance Company Partners do not adapt to the new CMS requirements or increase the efficiency with which they review our marketing material, or if we or our marketing partners are not successful in timely receiving Insurance Company Partner or CMS approval of our marketing materials, it could harm our sales and also harm our ability to efficiently change and implement new or existing marketing material, including call center scripts and our websites, which could impact negatively in our business, operating results and financial condition, particularly if such delay or non-compliance occurs during the Medicare annual enrollment period.\nE&O claims against us, and other incidents, claims, risks, exposures and/or liabilities that require us to make claims against our insurance policies, may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant insurance agency and brokerage operations, and are subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business resulting from alleged and actual E&O in placing insurance and rendering coverage advice. In addition, many of our Colleagues regularly interact with Clients and prospective Clients in the field, which increases the risks of property and casualty claims arising from such interactions. Further, many of our office locations are in jurisdictions (such as California, Texas and Florida) that see higher incidents of climate events (such as hurricanes, other aggressive weather patterns and earthquakes). Dealing with any of these activities can involve the expenditure of substantial amounts of money. Since E&O claims against us may allege our liability for all or part of the amounts in question, claimants may seek large damage awards. These claims can involve significant defense costs. E&O could include failure to, whether negligently or intentionally, place coverage on behalf of Clients, provide our Insurance Company Partners with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold on a fiduciary basis. It is not always possible to prevent or detect E&O and other types of claims, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases.\nWe have E&O insurance coverage to protect against the risk of liability resulting from our alleged and actual E&O. We also maintain a variety of other property and casualty policies of insurance providing varying degrees of protection against loss and damage to our property and liability for certain conduct of our Colleagues. Prices for these policies of insurance and the scope and limits of the coverage terms available depend on our claims history as well as market conditions that are outside of our control. While we endeavor to purchase coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of our risk, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages or whether our policies of insurance will cover such claims.\nIn establishing liabilities for claims, we utilize case level reviews by outside counsel and an internal analysis to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed annually and adjusted as developments warrant. Given the unpredictability of E&O and other claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.\nEfforts to reduce healthcare costs and alter healthcare financing practices could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is subject to increased governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels. Certain proposals have been made at the federal and state government levels in an effort to control healthcare costs, including proposing to lower reimbursement under the Medicare program. These proposals include \u201csingle payor\u201d government funded healthcare and price controls on prescription drugs. If these or similar efforts are successful, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, changing political, economic and regulatory influences may affect healthcare financing and reimbursement practices. If the current healthcare financing and reimbursement system changes significantly, our business could be materially adversely affected. Congress periodically considers proposals to reform the U.S. healthcare system such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act in 2010. Our Insurance Company Partners may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding them by reducing or delaying purchases of services that we provide. We cannot predict what effect, if any, these proposals may have on our business. Other legislative or market-driven changes in the healthcare system that we cannot anticipate could also materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flow from operations.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property and Cybersecurity\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, defend and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to grow our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition.\nWe have developed a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the \u201cBRP\u201d, \u201cBKS Partners\u201d, \u201cGuided Solutions\u201d, \u201cGuided Medicare Solutions\u201d, \u201cConnected Risk Solutions\u201d, \u201cMGA of the Future\u201d, \u201cInsurance Distribution Firm of the Future\u201d, \u201cInspired by Technology. Guided by Experts\u201d, \u201cCure8\u201d and \u201cInsight Beyond Insurance\u201d brands is critical to growing our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition. If we do not successfully build and maintain a strong brand, our business could be materially harmed. Maintaining and enhancing the quality of our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as marketing, community relations, outreach and employee training. We actively engage in advertisements, targeted promotional mailings and email communications, and engage on a regular basis in public relations and sponsorship activities. These investments may be substantial and may fail to encompass the optimal range of traditional, online and social advertising media to achieve maximum exposure and benefit to our brand. Moreover, our brand promotion activities may not generate brand awareness or yield increased revenue and, even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract new Clients or retain our existing Clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts.\nWe believe that our \u201cBRP\u201d, \u201cBKS Partners\u201d, \u201cGuided Solutions\u201d, \u201cGuided Medicare Solutions\u201d, \u201cConnected Risk Solutions\u201d, \u201cMGA of the Future\u201d, \u201cInsurance Distribution Firm of the Future\u201d, \u201cInspired by Technology. Guided by Experts\u201d, \u201cCure8\u201d and \u201cInsight Beyond Insurance\u201d trademarks (some of which are pending registration) have significant value and that these and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. Unauthorized uses or other infringement, misappropriation or violation of our trademarks, service marks or other intellectual property could diminish the value of our brand and may adversely affect our business. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every market in which we operate. Moreover, the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries may be inadequate. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that future trademark registrations for pending or future applications will issue, or that any registered trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. The USPTO and various foreign trademark offices also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the trademark registration process and after a registration has issued. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or cancellation of a trademark filing, resulting in partial or complete loss of trademark rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors might be able to enter the market under identical or similar brands.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could damage our brand and impair our ability to compete effectively. Even where we have effectively secured statutory protection for our trademarks and other intellectual property, our competitors and other third parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property. In the course of litigation, or as a preventative measure, such competitors and other third parties may attempt to challenge the scope of our rights or invalidate our intellectual property. If such challenges were to be successful, it could limit our ability to prevent others from using similar marks or designs may ultimately result in a reduced distinctiveness of our brand in the minds of consumers. Defending or enforcing our trademark rights, branding practices and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources and divert the attention of management, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations, even if such defense or enforcement is ultimately successful.\nFailure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws in the United States and certain other jurisdictions (whether via international convention, treaty or otherwise), trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, Colleagues, Clients, Partners and others. However, such measures provide only limited protection and the steps that we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate to deter infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property or proprietary information. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. In addition, even if we initiate litigation against third parties, such as suits alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property, we may not prevail. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Additionally, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. An adverse determination of any litigation proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related intellectual property at risk of not issuing or being cancelled. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMeanwhile, third parties may assert intellectual property-related claims against us, including claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of their intellectual property, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages, legal fees, settlement payments, royalty payments and other costs or damages, including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed, and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s resources, time and attention from other business concerns. Moreover, other companies, including our competitors, may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase costly licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available to us, it could be non-exclusive thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and we may be required to pay significant upfront fees, milestone payments or royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImproper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information, whether due to human error, misuse of information by Colleagues, contractors, vendors or third party bad actors, or as a result of cyberattacks or other security incidents with respect to our or our vendors\u2019 systems, tools, information, processes or services, or failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, industry standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy, security and/or cybersecurity, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal and financial liability, reputational harm, lost revenue, and remediation costs, and could have an adverse effect on our business and/or operations.\nWe maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our Company, our Colleagues, our Insurance Company Partners, our vendors and our actual and prospective Clients. This information could include personally identifiable information, protected health information, such as information regarding the medical history of Clients, financial information, and other categories of sensitive or protected information. We are subject to laws, rules, regulations, orders, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, transfer, storage, disposition and other processing of this information. These requirements may also apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with unaffiliated third-parties.\nCybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years, in part, because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to exchange information and conduct transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of computer hackers, organized crime, terrorists, and other external parties, including foreign state actors. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to cyberattacks. These cyberattacks could include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, social engineering attacks, denial of service or information, improper access by employees or third-party partners or other security breaches that have or could in the future result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our confidential, proprietary, personal, and other information concerning Colleagues, Clients, Insurance Company Partners, vendors or consumers, or otherwise materially disrupt our network access or business operations.\nCybersecurity breaches, cyberattacks and other similar incidents, including, among other things, computer viruses, denial of service or information attacks, ransomware attacks, credential stuffing, social engineering, human error, fraud, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, malware infections, phishing campaigns and vulnerability exploit attempts could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications or those of our vendors and impair our ability to provide services to our Clients and protect the privacy of their data. Any such incidents may also compromise confidential business information, result in intellectual property or other confidential or proprietary information being lost or stolen, including Client, Colleague or Company data, which could harm our reputation, competitive position or otherwise adversely affect our business. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, which makes it more difficult to detect cybersecurity incidents, assess their severity or impact in a timely manner, and successfully defend against them. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic generally is increasing the attack surface available to criminals, as more companies and individuals work remotely and otherwise work online. Consequently, the risk of a cybersecurity incident has increased, and as cybersecurity threats evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities, security breaches, cyberattacks or other similar incidents. We cannot provide assurances that our preventative efforts, or those of our vendors or service providers, will be successful, and we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, cyberattacks or other similar incidents, detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner, implement guaranteed preventive measures against such incidents, or adequately remediate any such incident.\nAlthough we maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information, we cannot eliminate the risk of, and have in the past experienced, improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information and related costs to mitigate the consequences from such events. It is possible that the measures we implement, including our security controls over personal data and training of Colleagues on data security, may not prevent improper access to, disclosure of or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information. This could cause harm to our reputation, create legal exposure or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of commissions and fees. In addition, improper access to or disclosure of personal and proprietary information could occur in a target we acquire prior to the acquisition or as a result of actions taken prior to the acquisition or during the integration period. Even if we receive indemnification for such events (which may not be the cure), such events could cause harm to our reputation, create legal exposure or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data.\nThe occurrence of any security breach, cyberattack or other similar incident with respect to our or our vendors\u2019 systems, or our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, regulators, law enforcement agencies or affected individuals, as applicable, following any such event, could cause harm to our reputation, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation, fines, damages or injunctions or subject us to liability under applicable data privacy, cybersecurity and other laws, rules and regulations, resulting in increased costs or loss of commissions and fees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for cybersecurity liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nWe are subject to complex and frequently changing laws, rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate relating to the collection, use, retention, security, transfer, storage, disposition and other processing of personal information. For example, legislators in the United States are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies. These and similar initiatives around the country could increase the cost of developing, implementing or securing our networks, tools, systems and other information technology assets and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, adding to our information technology and compliance costs. Ensuring that our collection, use, retention, security, transfer, storage, disposition and other processing of personal information complies with applicable laws, regulations, rules and standards regarding data privacy and cybersecurity in relevant jurisdictions can increase operating costs, impact the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency.\nAt the federal level, we are subject to, among other laws, rules and regulations, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLBA\"), which requires financial institutions to, among other things, periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing personal information and, in some cases, enables retail customers to opt out of the sharing of certain personal information with unaffiliated third parties. The GLBA also requires financial institutions to implement an information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of consumer records and information. We are also subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including with respect to data privacy and cybersecurity. Moreover, the United States Congress has recently considered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity legislation, to which we may be subject if passed. Data privacy and cybersecurity are also areas of increasing state legislative focus and we are, or may in the future become, subject to various state laws and regulations regarding data privacy and cybersecurity. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the \"CCPA\"), which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. The CCPA gives California residents the right to, among other things, request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold to others, request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), opt out of the sale of their personal information, and not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including an exemption applicable to personal information that is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA. Further, effective in most material respects starting on January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\") (which was passed via a ballot initiative as part of the November 2020 election) will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding California residents\u2019 rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency which will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. Other states where we do business, or may in the future do business, or from which we otherwise collect, or may in the future otherwise collect, personal information of residents have adopted or are considering adopting similar laws. For example, Virginia and Colorado have recently adopted comprehensive data privacy laws similar to the CCPA, which will go into effect in January and July of 2023, respectively. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states generally require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been improperly accessed, disclosed or otherwise compromised as a result of a data breach. Certain state laws and regulations may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal or other state laws and regulations, and such laws and regulations may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts and increase compliance costs. Aspects of the CCPA, the CPRA, and other federal and state laws and regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear, and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them.\nFurther, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, regulations, rules and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy or cybersecurity. Although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy, data protection and cybersecurity can subject us to potential federal or state action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.\nAny actual or perceived failure to adhere to, or successfully implement processes in response to, changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area or to comply with our privacy policies could result in legal liability, including litigation (including class actions), claims, proceedings, regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, damage to our reputation in the marketplace and other adverse impacts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on information processing systems. Data breaches or other security incidents with respect to our or our vendors' information processing systems may hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to provide insurance services to Clients and to create and maintain comprehensive tracking and reporting of Client accounts depends on our capacity to collect, store, retrieve and otherwise process data, manage significant databases and expand and periodically upgrade our information processing capabilities. As our operations evolve, we will need to continue to make investments in new and enhanced information systems. Additionally, as our information system providers revise and upgrade their hardware, software and equipment technology, we may encounter difficulties integrating these new technologies into our business. Interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities or adverse consequences from implementing new or enhanced systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the course of providing financial services, we may electronically store, transmit or otherwise process personally identifiable information, such as social security numbers or credit card or bank information, of Clients or employees of Clients. Breaches in data security or infiltration of our network security by unauthorized persons could cause interruptions in operations and damage to our reputation, among other adverse impacts. While we maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of, and have in the past experienced, improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information and related costs to mitigate the consequences from such events. Privacy laws, rules and regulations are matters of growing public concern and are continuously changing in the states in which we operate. The failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these laws, rules and regulations could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation.\nFurther, despite security measures we and our vendors take, our systems and those of our vendors may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, unauthorized access, viruses or other disruptive problems. As we continue to expand our business through Partnerships, we may be exposed to increased vulnerability to data breaches, cybersecurity attacks and other security incidents during the integration of information systems. If our systems or facilities were infiltrated or damaged, our Clients could experience data loss, financial loss and significant business interruption leading to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications.\nWe rely on the availability and performance of information technology services provided by third parties.\nWhile we maintain some of our critical information technology systems, we also depend on third-party service providers to provide important information technology services relating to, among other things, agency management services, sales and service support, network, device and event monitoring, cybersecurity, electronic communications and certain finance functions. If the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through a security breach, the loss of sensitive, personal or confidential data through a security breach, or otherwise. While we and our third-party service providers have not experienced any significant disruption, failure or breach impacting our or their information technology systems, any such disruption, failure or breach could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Organizational Structure\nWe are a holding company with our principal asset being our 51% ownership interest in BRP; accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from BRP to pay dividends, if any, and taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and pay other expenses.\nWe are a holding company and our principal asset is our direct or indirect ownership of 51% of the outstanding LLC Units. We have no independent means of generating commissions and fees. As the sole managing member of BRP, we intend to cause BRP to make distributions to the holders of LLC Units and us, in amounts sufficient to (i) cover all applicable taxes payable by us and the holders of LLC Units, (ii) allow us to make any payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement we entered into as part of the Reorganization Transactions and (iii) fund dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy, to the extent that our board of directors declares such dividends.\nDeterioration in the financial conditions, earnings or cash flow of BRP and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and BRP is restricted from making such distributions to us under applicable law or regulation, as a result of covenants in its debt agreements or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain such funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and, as a result, could suffer a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn certain circumstances, BRP will be required to make distributions to us and the other holders of LLC Units, and the distributions that BRP will be required to make may be substantial.\nUnder the Amended LLC Agreement, BRP will generally be required from time to time to make pro rata distributions in cash to us and the other holders of LLC Units at certain assumed tax rates in amounts that are intended to be sufficient to cover the taxes on our and the other LLC Unit holders\u2019 respective allocable shares of the taxable income of BRP. As a result of (i) potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and the other LLC Unit holders, (ii) the lower tax rate applicable to corporations than individuals and (iii) the favorable tax benefits that we anticipate receiving from (a) previous acquisitions by BRP Group of LLC Units and future taxable redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units for shares of our Class A common stock or cash and (b) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we expect that these tax distributions will be in amounts that exceed our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our board of directors will determine the appropriate uses for any excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, dividends, repurchases of our Class A common stock, the payment of obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and the payment of other expenses. We will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to our stockholders. No adjustments to the redemption or exchange ratio of LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock will be made as a result of either (i) any cash distribution by us or (ii) any cash that we retain and do not distribute to our stockholders. To the extent that we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on our Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances or lend them to BRP, holders of LLC Units would benefit from any value attributable to such cash balances as a result of their ownership of Class A common stock following a redemption or exchange of their LLC Units.\nWe are controlled by BRP\u2019s LLC Members whose interests in our business may be different than yours, and certain statutory provisions afforded to stockholders are not applicable to us.\nBRP\u2019s LLC Members control approximately 49% of the combined voting power of our common stock at December 31, 2021. Further, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement we and the Pre-IPO LLC Members (who collectively control 23% of the consolidated voting power of our common stock as of December 31, 2021) entered into, Pre-IPO LLC Members may approve or disapprove substantially all transactions and other matters requiring approval by our stockholders, such as a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, any dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of us or our subsidiaries or any acquisition or disposition of any asset in excess of 5% of total assets, the incurrence, guarantee, assumption or refinancing of indebtedness, or grant of a security interest, in excess of 10% of total assets (or that would cause aggregate indebtedness or guarantees thereof to exceed 10% of total assets), the issuance or redemption of certain additional equity interests in an amount exceeding $10 million, the establishment or amendment of any equity, purchase or bonus plan for the benefit of employees, consultants, officers or directors, any capital or other expenditure in excess of 5% of total assets, the declaration or payment of dividends on capital stock or distributions by BRP on LLC Units other than tax distributions as defined in the Amended LLC Agreement. Other matters requiring approval by BRP\u2019s LLC Members pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement include changing the number of directors on our board of directors, changing the jurisdiction of incorporation, changing the location of BRP\u2019s headquarters, changing the name of BRP, amendments to governing documents, adopting a shareholder rights plan and any changes to BRP\u2019s fiscal year or public accountants. In addition, the Stockholders Agreement provides that approval by BRP\u2019s LLC Members is required for any changes to the strategic direction or scope of BRP Group and BRP\u2019s business, any acquisition or disposition of any asset or business having consideration or fair value in excess of 5% of our total assets and the hiring and termination of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Partnership Officer or other change to senior management or key Colleagues (including terms of compensation). Furthermore, the Stockholders Agreement provides that, for so long as the Pre-IPO LLC Members beneficially hold at least 10% of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our common stock (the \u201cSubstantial Ownership Requirement\u201d), Pre-IPO LLC Members may designate a majority of the nominees for election to our board of directors, including the nominee for election to serve as Chairman of our board of directors. A group comprised of Baldwin Insurance Group Holdings, LLC, an entity controlled by Lowry Baldwin, our Chairman, Lowry Baldwin, Elizabeth Krystyn, Laura Sherman, Trevor Baldwin, our Chief Executive Officer, Kris Wiebeck, our Chief Strategy Officer, John Valentine, our Chief Partnership Officer, Dan Galbraith, our Chief Operating Officer, Brad Hale, our Chief Financial Officer, Joseph Finney, Highland Risk Services LLC and certain trusts established by such individuals have entered into a voting agreement, as amended, or the Voting Agreement, with Lowry Baldwin, our Chairman, pursuant to which, in connection with any meeting of our shareholders or any written consent of our shareholders, each such person and trust party thereto will agree to vote or exercise their right to consent in the manner directed by Lowry Baldwin. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Lowry Baldwin through the Voting Agreement beneficially owns 31.2% of the voting power of our common stock.\nThis concentration of ownership and voting power may also delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control of our Company, which could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of Class A common stock and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of the Pre-IPO LLC Members, even if such events are in the best interests of minority stockholders. Furthermore, this concentration of voting power with Pre-IPO LLC Members may have a negative impact on the price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Pre-IPO LLC Members will have the ability to designate a majority of the nominees for election to our board of directors, including the nominee for election to serve as Chairman of our board of directors until the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer met. As a result, Pre-IPO LLC Members may not be inclined to permit us to issue additional shares of Class A common stock, including for the facilitation of acquisitions, if it would dilute their holdings below the 10% threshold.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual-class structure, combined with the concentrated control of Pre-IPO LLC Members, will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituents of its indexes to have greater than 5% of the company\u2019s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it will no longer admit companies with multiple-class share structures to certain of its indexes. Because of our dual-class structure, we will likely be excluded from these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nPre-IPO LLC Members\u2019 interests may not be fully aligned with yours, which could lead to actions that are not in your best interests. Because the Pre-IPO LLC Members hold a majority of their economic interests in our business through BRP rather than through BRP Group, they may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A common stock. For example, the Pre-IPO LLC Members may have a different tax position from us, which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets or incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement and whether and when we should undergo certain changes of control for purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement or terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) makes audit adjustments to BRP\u2019s federal income tax returns, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from BRP. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, BRP is required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest, BRP\u2019s cash available for distributions to us may be substantially reduced. These rules are not applicable to BRP for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017. In addition, the Pre-IPO LLC Members\u2019 significant ownership in us and resulting ability to effectively control us may discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in us, or could discourage transactions involving a change in control, including transactions in which you as a holder of shares of our Class A common stock might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over the then-current market price.\nOur certificate of incorporation and Stockholders Agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d under Delaware law will only apply against our directors and officers and their respective affiliates for competing activities related to insurance brokerage activities. This doctrine will not apply to any business activity other than insurance brokerage activities. Furthermore, the Pre-IPO LLC Members have business relationships outside of our business.\nWe will be required to pay BRP\u2019s LLC Members and any other persons that become parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may receive, and the amounts we may pay could be significant.\nPrevious acquisitions by BRP Group of LLC Units from BRP's LLC Members and future taxable redemptions or exchanges by BRP\u2019s LLC Members of LLC Units for shares of our Class A common stock or cash, as well as other transactions described herein, are expected to result in tax basis adjustments to the assets of BRP that will be allocated to us and thus produce favorable tax attributes. These tax attributes would not be available to us in the absence of those transactions. The tax basis adjustments are expected to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement with BRP\u2019s LLC Members provides for the payment by us to BRP\u2019s LLC Members of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in BRP Group\u2019s assets resulting from (a) previous acquisitions by BRP Group of LLC Units from BRP\u2019s LLC Members, (b) the purchase of LLC Units from BRP\u2019s LLC Members using the net proceeds from any future offering, (c) redemptions or exchanges by BRP\u2019s LLC Members of LLC Units for shares of our Class A common stock or cash or (d) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest resulting from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are our obligations and not obligations of BRP.\nThe actual increases in tax basis with respect to future taxable redemptions, exchanges or purchases of LLC Units, as well as the amount and timing of any payments we are required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will depend on a number of factors, including the market value of our Class A common stock at the time of future redemptions or exchanges, the prevailing federal tax rates applicable to us over the life of the Tax Receivable Agreement (as well as the assumed combined state and local tax rate), the amount and timing of the taxable income that we generate in the future and the extent to which future redemptions, exchanges or purchases of LLC Units are taxable transactions.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned on BRP\u2019s LLC Members\u2019 continued ownership of us. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual benefits we receive in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and/or distributions to us by BRP are not sufficient to permit us to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nIn addition, although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge the tax basis increases or other benefits arising under the Tax Receivable Agreement, BRP\u2019s LLC Members will not reimburse us for any payments previously made if such tax basis increases or other tax benefits are subsequently disallowed, except that any excess payments made to BRP\u2019s LLC Members will be netted against future payments otherwise to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, if any, after our determination of such excess. As a result, in such circumstances, we could make payments to BRP\u2019s LLC Members under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than our actual cash tax savings and we may not be able to recoup those payments, which could negatively impact our liquidity.\nIn addition, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, upon certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combination, or certain other changes of control, our or our successor\u2019s obligations with respect to tax benefits would be based on certain assumptions, including that we or our successor would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, upon a change of control, we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than the specified percentage of our actual cash tax savings, which could negatively impact our liquidity.\nThis provision of the Tax Receivable Agreement may result in situations where BRP\u2019s LLC Members have interests that differ from or are in addition to those of our other stockholders. In addition, we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantial and in excess of our, or a potential acquirer\u2019s, actual cash savings in income tax.\nOur obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will also apply with respect to any person who is issued LLC Units in the future and who becomes a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nFinally, because we are a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement depends on the ability of BRP to make distributions to us. The JPM Credit Agreement restricts the ability of BRP to make distributions to us, which could affect our ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid, which could negatively impact our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in periods in which such payments are made.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nWe recently ceased to be an emerging growth company, and now are required to comply with certain heightened reporting requirements, including those relating to auditing standards and disclosure about our executive compensation.\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including certain requirements relating to auditing standards and compensation disclosure. Prior to December 31, 2021, we were classified as an emerging growth company. As an emerging growth company, we were not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (iii) provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. When we were an emerging growth company, we followed the exemptions described above. We also elected to use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allowed us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not have been comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, and our stockholders and potential investors may have difficulty in analyzing our historical operating results if comparing us to such companies. In addition, because we relied on exemptions available to emerging growth companies, our historical public filings contained less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe expect to incur additional costs associated with the heightened reporting requirements described above, including the requirement to provide auditor\u2019s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as additional audit costs resulting from PCAOB requirements. In addition, our auditors may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity, and we may incur significant costs to remediate those deficiencies or otherwise improve our internal controls. As a public company, we are required to report any control deficiencies that constitute a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d in our internal control over financial reporting, and doing so could impair our ability to raise capital and otherwise adversely affect the value of our securities. See \u201c-We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of these material weaknesses is not effective, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may deter third parties from acquiring us and diminish the value of our Class A common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022division of our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class as equal in number as possible, serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022until the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer met, BRP\u2019s LLC Members may designate a majority of the nominees for election to our board of directors, including the nominee for election to serve as Chairman of our board of directors;\n\u2022our ability to issue additional shares of Class A common stock and to issue preferred stock with terms that our board of directors may determine, in each case without stockholder approval (other than as specified in our certificate of incorporation);\n\u2022the absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations.\nThese provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company that is in the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to nominate directors for election to our board of directors and take other corporate actions.\nWe may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in the future, which could cause dilution to investors and otherwise adversely affect our stock price.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to make acquisitions. As part of our acquisition strategy, we may issue shares of our common stock, as well as LLC Units of BRP, as consideration for such acquisitions. These issuances could be significant. To the extent that we make acquisitions and issue our shares of common stock as consideration, your equity interest in us will be diluted. Any such issuance will also increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock that will be eligible for sale in the future. Persons receiving shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions may be more likely to sell off their common stock, which may influence the price of our common stock. In addition, the potential issuance of additional shares in connection with anticipated acquisitions could lessen demand for our common stock and result in a lower price than might otherwise be obtained. We may issue a significant amount of our common stock in the future for other purposes as well, including in connection with financings, including to finance the cash portion of acquisition consideration to execute on our Partnership strategy, for compensation purposes, in connection with strategic transactions or for other purposes.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of these material weaknesses is not effective, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with our audit of the fiscal year 2021 consolidated financial statements, we identified three material weaknesses in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses relate to: (i) a lack of sufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately; (ii) insufficient policies and procedures to achieve complete and accurate financial accounting, reporting and disclosures and (iii) failure to design and maintain controls over the operating effectiveness of information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) general controls, all of which were originally identified in connection with the audit of our 2018 consolidated financial statements and still exist as of December 31, 2021.\nWe are continuing the process of planning and implementing a number of steps to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and to address these material weaknesses. We have completed the hiring of key personnel in the accounting department with technical accounting and financial reporting experience and have enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial statement close process. We are continuing to document and improve our processes, implement internal controls procedures and design and implement IT general computer controls.\nWe cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. We will be required in future years to document and assess the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIf we fail to effectively remediate these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we identify future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if we are unable to comply with the demands that will be placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in a timely manner, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by the SEC. In addition, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we may face restricted access to the capital markets and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe expect that our stock price will be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline, and you may not be able to resell your shares for a profit.\nSecurities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock regardless of our results of operations. The trading price of our Class A common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022market conditions in the broader stock market in general, or in our industry in particular;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financials and results of operations;\n\u2022introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022investor perceptions of us and the industries in which we or our Clients operate;\n\u2022low trading volumes or sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our Class A common stock, including those by our existing investors or our Partners;\n\u2022concentration of Class A common stock ownership;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022regulatory or political developments;\n\u2022litigation and governmental investigations;\n\u2022changing economic and political conditions;\n\u2022the perceived adequacy of our ESG efforts;\n\u2022our ability or perceived ability to:\n\u25e6attract new Clients, successfully deploy and implement our products, obtain Client renewals and provide our Clients with excellent Client support;\n\u25e6increase our network of Insurance Company Partners and the profit-sharing, override and/or contingent commissions that we earn from such Insurance Company Partners;\n\u25e6adequately expand, train, integrate and retain our Colleagues, including our executive officers and senior leaders, and maintain or increase our sales force\u2019s productivity;\n\u25e6improve our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely and accurate reporting of our operational and financial results;\n\u25e6successfully introduce new products and enhance existing products;\n\u25e6successfully deploy information technology assets for use by our Colleagues and interaction with our Clients and Insurance Company Partners;\n\u25e6adapt to the ever-changing regulatory and legal landscape;\n\u25e6protect sensitive, personal and confidential information and data within BRP\u2019s custody from third party bad actors;\n\u25e6successfully identify and acquire new Partners;\n\u25e6successfully integrate Partnerships into the Company in an operationally efficient manner;\n\u25e6service our existing indebtedness;\n\u25e6access the capital markets or otherwise obtain access to capital to satisfy future needs of the Company;\n\u25e6successfully introduce our products to new markets and geographies; and\n\u25e6successfully compete against larger companies and new market entrants.\n\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business, including developments relating to the health care industry and the marketing and sale of Medicare plans.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our Class A common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Class A common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be limited by our holding company structure, contractual restrictions and regulatory requirements.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of LLC Units in BRP and we do not have any independent means of generating commissions and fees. We intend to cause BRP to make pro rata distributions to BRP\u2019s LLC Members and us in an amount at least sufficient to allow us and BRP\u2019s LLC Members to pay all applicable taxes, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and to pay our corporate and other overhead expenses. BRP is a distinct legal entity and may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions that, under certain circumstances, may limit our ability to obtain cash from them. If BRP is unable to make distributions, we may not receive adequate distributions, which could materially and adversely affect our dividends and financial position and our ability to fund any dividends.\nOur board of directors will periodically review the cash generated from our business and the capital expenditures required to finance our global growth plans and determine whether to declare periodic dividends to our stockholders. Our board of directors will take into account general economic and business conditions, including our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, including restrictions and covenants contained in the JPM Credit Agreement, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant. In addition, the JPM Credit Agreement limits the amount of distributions that BRP can make to us and the purposes for which distributions could be made. Accordingly, we may not be able to pay dividends even if our board of directors would otherwise deem it appropriate. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section under Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have research coverage by industry and securities analysts. If no or few analysts continue coverage of us, the trading price of our Class A common stock would likely decrease. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our Class A common stock, we could lose visibility in the trading market for our Class A common stock, which in turn could cause our Class A common stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 19002, "SIC": 6411, "TIC": "BRP"}
