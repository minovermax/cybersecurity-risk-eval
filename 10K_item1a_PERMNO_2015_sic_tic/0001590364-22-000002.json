Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating us and our shares. Any of the following risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The risk factors generally have been separated into the following categories: risks related to our business, risks related to our Manager, risks related to taxation, risks related to our common shares and general risks. However, these categories do overlap and should not be considered exclusive.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA pandemic, including COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn recent years, the outbreaks of certain highly contagious diseases have increased the risk of a pandemic resulting in economic disruptions. In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the market and the global, U.S. and regional economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown. In response, various governmental bodies and private enterprises have implemented, and may in the future implement, numerous measures intended to mitigate the outbreak, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shutdowns and testing or vaccination mandates. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic and evolving, including a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in certain geographies, and its ultimate scope, duration and impact, including the efficacy and availability of vaccines, remain uncertain.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our Jefferson Terminal business in several material ways during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021. Although difficult to quantify the impact, the pandemic adversely affected macro trends in refinery utilization rates in the United States and the global consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels in 2020 and part of 2021, which adversely affected our revenue potential at our Jefferson Terminal business. In addition, we were unable to complete anticipated new customer contracts and certain of our existing customers did not increase volumes as anticipated which also adversely affected our revenue potential for those periods.\nWe expect that this pandemic, and any future epidemic or pandemic crises, could result in direct and indirect adverse effects on our industry and customers, which in turn may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Effects of the current pandemic have included, or may in the future include, among others:\n\u2022deterioration of worldwide, regional or national economic conditions and activity, which could adversely affect global demand for crude oil and petroleum products, demand for our services, and time charter and spot rates;\n\u2022disruptions to our operations as a result of the potential health impact, such as the availability and efficacy of vaccines, on our employees and crew, and on the workforces of our customers and business partners;\n\u2022disruptions to our business from, or additional costs related to, new regulations, directives or practices implemented in response to the pandemic, such as travel restrictions, increased inspection regimes, hygiene measures (such as quarantining and physical distancing) or increased implementation of remote working arrangements;\n\u2022a lack of air travel demand or an inability of airlines to operate to or from certain regions could impact demand for air travel and the financial health of certain airlines, including our lessees;\n\u2022potential delays in the loading and discharging of cargo on or from our vessels, and any related off hire due to global supply chain disruptions resulting from quarantines, worker health, regulations or other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn could disrupt our operations and result in a reduction of revenue;\n\u2022potential shortages or a lack of access to required spare parts for our vessels, or potential delays in any repairs to, scheduled or unscheduled maintenance or modifications;\n\u2022potential delays in vessel inspections and related certifications by class societies, customers or government agencies;\n\u2022potential reduced cash flows and financial condition, including potential liquidity constraints;\n\u2022reduced access to or increased cost of capital, including the ability to refinance any existing obligations, as a result of any credit tightening generally or due to continued declines in global financial markets, including potential interest rate increases and declines in the prices of publicly-traded securities of us, our peers and of listed companies generally; and\n\u2022potential deterioration in the financial condition and prospects of our customers, joint venture partners or business partners, or attempts by customers or third parties to invoke force majeure contractual clauses as a result of delays or other disruptions.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, and the actions that may be required to try and contain COVID-19 or treat its impact. We continue to monitor the pandemic and, the extent to which the continued spread of the virus adversely affects our customer base and therefore revenue. As the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and rapidly evolving, our plans as described above may change. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nUncertainty relating to macroeconomic conditions may reduce the demand for our assets, result in non-performance of contracts by our lessees or charterers, limit our ability to obtain additional capital to finance new investments, or have other unforeseen negative effects.\nUncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and commodity price volatility, historically have created difficult operating environments for owners and operators in the transportation industry. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our operating results or financial condition and/or affect the lessees and charterers that form our customer base. For some years, the world has experienced weakened economic conditions and volatility following adverse changes in global capital markets. Excess supply in oil and gas markets can put significant downward pressure on prices for these commodities, and may affect demand for assets used in production, refining and transportation of oil and gas. In the past, a significant decline in oil prices has led to lower offshore exploration and production budgets worldwide. These conditions have resulted in significant contraction, deleveraging and reduced liquidity in the credit markets. A number of governments have implemented, or are considering implementing, a broad variety of governmental actions or new regulations for the financial markets. In addition, limitations on the availability of capital, higher costs of capital for financing expenditures or the desire to preserve liquidity, may cause our current or prospective customers to make reductions in future capital budgets and spending.\nFurther, demand for our assets is related to passenger and cargo traffic growth, which in turn is dependent on general business and economic conditions. Global economic downturns could have an adverse impact on passenger and cargo traffic levels and consequently our lessees\u2019 and charterers\u2019 business, which may in turn result in a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital and a deterioration in the value of our assets. We may also become exposed to increased credit risk from our customers and third parties who have obligations to us, which could result in increased non-performance of contracts by our lessees or charterers and adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe industries in which we operate have experienced periods of oversupply during which lease rates and asset values have declined, particularly during the most recent economic downturn, and any future oversupply could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe oversupply of a specific asset is likely to depress the lease or charter rates for and the value of that type of asset and result in decreased utilization of our assets, and the industries in which we operate have experienced periods of oversupply during which rates and asset values have declined, particularly during the most recent economic downturn. Factors that could lead to such oversupply include, without limitation:\n\u2022general demand for the type of assets that we purchase;\n\u2022general macroeconomic conditions, including market prices for commodities that our assets may serve;\n\u2022geopolitical events, including war, prolonged armed conflict and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022outbreaks of communicable diseases and natural disasters;\n\u2022governmental regulation;\n\u2022interest rates;\n\u2022the availability of credit;\n\u2022restructurings and bankruptcies of companies in the industries in which we operate, including our customers;\n\u2022manufacturer production levels and technological innovation;\n\u2022manufacturers merging or exiting the industry or ceasing to produce certain asset types;\n\u2022retirement and obsolescence of the assets that we own;\n\u2022increases in supply levels of assets in the market due to the sale or merging of operating lessors; and\n\u2022reintroduction of previously unused or dormant assets into the industries in which we operate.\nThese and other related factors are generally outside of our control and could lead to persistence of, or increase in, the oversupply of the types of assets that we acquire or decreased utilization of our assets, either of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. In addition, lessees may redeliver our assets to locations where there is oversupply, which may lead to additional repositioning costs for us if we move them to areas with higher demand. Positioning expenses vary depending on geographic location, distance, freight rates and other factors, and may not be fully covered by drop-off charges collected from the last lessees of the equipment or pick-up charges paid by the new lessees. Positioning expenses can be significant if a large portion of our assets are returned to locations with weak demand, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that any target returns will be achieved.\nOur target returns for assets are targets only and are not forecasts of future profits. We develop target returns based on our Manager\u2019s assessment of appropriate expectations for returns on assets and the ability of our Manager to enhance the return generated by those assets through active management. There can be no assurance that these assessments and expectations will be achieved and failure to achieve any or all of them may materially adversely impact our ability to achieve any target return with respect to any or all of our assets.\nIn addition, our target returns are based on estimates and assumptions regarding a number of other factors, including, without limitation, holding periods, the absence of material adverse events affecting specific investments (which could include, without limitation, natural disasters, terrorism, social unrest or civil disturbances), general and local economic and market conditions, changes in law, taxation, regulation or governmental policies and changes in the political approach to transportation investment, either generally or in specific countries in which we may invest or seek to invest. Many of these factors, as well as the other risks described elsewhere in this report, are beyond our control and all could adversely affect our ability to achieve a target return with respect to an asset. Further, target returns are targets for the return generated by specific assets and not by us. Numerous factors could prevent us from achieving similar returns, notwithstanding the performance of individual assets, including, without limitation, taxation and fees payable by us or our operating subsidiaries, including fees and incentive allocation payable to our Manager.\nThere can be no assurance that the returns generated by any of our assets will meet our target returns, or any other level of return, or that we will achieve or successfully implement our asset acquisition objectives, and failure to achieve the target return in respect of any of our assets could, among other things, have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, even if the returns generated by individual assets meet target returns, there can be no assurance that the returns generated by other existing or future assets would do so, and the historical performance of the assets in our existing portfolio should not be considered as indicative of future results with respect to any assets.\nContractual defaults may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by decreasing revenues and increasing storage, positioning, collection, recovery and lost equipment expenses.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on the success of the operators in the sectors in which we participate. Cash flows from our assets are substantially impacted by our ability to collect compensation and other amounts to be paid in respect of such assets from the customers with whom we enter into leases, charters or other contractual arrangements. Inherent in the\nnature of the leases, charters and other arrangements for the use of such assets is the risk that we may not receive, or may experience delay in realizing, such amounts to be paid. While we target the entry into contracts with credit-worthy counterparties, no assurance can be given that such counterparties will perform their obligations during the term of the leases, charters or other contractual arrangements. In addition, when counterparties default, we may fail to recover all of our assets, and the assets we do recover may be returned in damaged condition or to locations where we will not be able to efficiently lease, charter or sell them. In most cases, we maintain, or require our lessees to maintain, certain insurances to cover the risk of damages or loss of our assets. However, these insurance policies may not be sufficient to protect us against a loss.\nDepending on the specific sector, the risk of contractual defaults may be elevated due to excess capacity as a result of oversupply during the most recent economic downturn. We lease assets to our customers pursuant to fixed-price contracts, and our customers then seek to utilize those assets to transport goods and provide services. If the price at which our customers receive for their transportation services decreases as a result of an oversupply in the marketplace, then our customers may be forced to reduce their prices in order to attract business (which may have an adverse effect on their ability to meet their contractual lease obligations to us), or may seek to renegotiate or terminate their contractual lease arrangements with us to pursue a lower-priced opportunity with another lessor, which may have a direct, adverse effect on us. See \u201c-The industries in which we operate have experienced periods of oversupply during which lease rates and asset values have declined, particularly during the most recent economic downturn, and any future oversupply could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\u201d Any default by a material customer would have a significant impact on our profitability at the time the customer defaulted, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. In addition, some of our counterparties may reside in jurisdictions with legal and regulatory regimes that make it difficult and costly to enforce such counterparties\u2019 obligations.\nIf we acquire a high concentration of a particular type of asset, or concentrate our investments in a particular sector, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in market demand or problems specific to that asset or sector.\nIf we acquire a high concentration of a particular asset, or concentrate our investments in a particular sector, our business and financial results could be adversely affected by sector-specific or asset-specific factors. For example, if a particular sector experiences difficulties such as increased competition or oversupply, the operators we rely on as a lessor may be adversely affected and consequently our business and financial results may be similarly affected. If we acquire a high concentration of a particular asset and the market demand for a particular asset declines, it is redesigned or replaced by its manufacturer or it experiences design or technical problems, the value and rates relating to such asset may decline, and we may be unable to lease or charter such asset on favorable terms, if at all. Any decrease in the value and rates of our assets may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets.\nThe business of acquiring transportation and transportation-related infrastructure assets is highly competitive. Market competition for opportunities includes traditional transportation and infrastructure companies, commercial and investment banks, as well as a growing number of non-traditional participants, such as hedge funds, private equity funds and other private investors, including Fortress-related entities. Some of these competitors may have access to greater amounts of capital and/or to capital that may be committed for longer periods of time or may have different return thresholds than us, and thus these competitors may have certain advantages not shared by us. In addition, competitors may have incurred, or may in the future incur, leverage to finance their debt investments at levels or on terms more favorable than those available to us. Strong competition for investment opportunities could result in fewer such opportunities for us, as certain of these competitors have established and are establishing investment vehicles that target the same types of assets that we intend to purchase.\nIn addition, some of our competitors may have longer operating histories, greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than us, and consequently, may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of our target markets. We likely will not always be able to compete successfully with our competitors and competitive pressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition, particularly during industry downturns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain liens may arise on our assets.\nCertain of our assets are currently subject to liens under separate financing arrangements entered into by certain subsidiaries in connection with acquisitions of assets. In the event of a default under such arrangements by the applicable subsidiary, the lenders thereunder would be permitted to take possession of or sell such assets. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d In addition, our currently owned assets and assets that we purchase in the future may be subject to other liens based on the industry practices relating to such assets. Until they are discharged, these liens could impair our ability to repossess, re-lease or sell our assets, and to the extent our lessees or charterers do not comply with their obligations to discharge any liens on the applicable assets, we may find it necessary to pay the claims secured by such liens in order to repossess such assets. Such payments could materially adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nThe values of our assets may fluctuate due to various factors.\nThe fair market values of our assets may decrease or increase depending on a number of factors, including the prevailing level of charter or lease rates from time to time, general economic and market conditions affecting our target markets, type and age of\nassets, supply and demand for assets, competition, new governmental or other regulations and technological advances, all of which could impact our profitability and our ability to lease, charter, develop, operate, or sell such assets. In addition, our assets depreciate as they age and may generate lower revenues and cash flows. We must be able to replace such older, depreciated assets with newer assets, or our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and cash flows will decline. In addition, if we dispose of an asset for a price that is less than the depreciated book value of the asset on our balance sheet or if we determine that an asset\u2019s value has been impaired, we will recognize a related charge in our consolidated statement of operations and such charge could be material.\nWe may not generate a sufficient amount of cash or generate sufficient free cash flow to fund our operations or repay our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness as required depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. This ability, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, including interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot provide assurance that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timeliness and amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. Furthermore, our ability to refinance would depend upon the condition of the finance and credit markets. Our inability to generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, would materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may acquire operating businesses, including businesses whose operations are not fully matured and stabilized. These businesses may be subject to significant operating and development risks, including increased competition, cost overruns and delays, and difficulties in obtaining approvals or financing. These factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future acquire, operating businesses, including businesses whose operations are not fully matured and stabilized (including, but not limited to, our businesses within the Jefferson Terminal, Ports and Terminals and Transtar segments). While we have deep experience in the construction and operation of these companies, we are nevertheless subject to significant risks and contingencies of an operating business, and these risks are greater where the operations of such businesses are not fully matured and stabilized. Key factors that may affect our operating businesses include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022competition from market participants;\n\u2022general economic and/or industry trends, including pricing for the products or services offered by our operating businesses;\n\u2022the issuance and/or continued availability of necessary permits, licenses, approvals and agreements from governmental agencies and third parties as are required to construct and operate such businesses;\n\u2022changes or deficiencies in the design or construction of development projects;\n\u2022unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems;\n\u2022potential increases in construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost and availability of fuel, power, materials and supplies;\n\u2022the availability and cost of skilled labor and equipment;\n\u2022our ability to enter into additional satisfactory agreements with contractors and to maintain good relationships with these contractors in order to construct development projects within our expected cost parameters and time frame, and the ability of those contractors to perform their obligations under the contracts and to maintain their creditworthiness;\n\u2022potential liability for injury or casualty losses which are not covered by insurance;\n\u2022potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local or other groups which may delay or prevent development activities;\n\u2022local and economic conditions;\n\u2022changes in legal requirements; and\n\u2022force majeure events, including catastrophes and adverse weather conditions.\nAny of these factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur use of joint ventures or partnerships, and our Manager\u2019s outsourcing of certain functions, may present unforeseen obstacles or costs.\nWe have acquired and may in the future acquire interests in certain assets in cooperation with third-party partners or co-investors through jointly-owned acquisition vehicles, joint ventures or other structures. In these co-investment situations, our ability to control the management of such assets depends upon the nature and terms of the joint arrangements with such partners and our relative ownership stake in the asset, each of which will be determined by negotiation at the time of the investment and the determination of which is subject to the discretion of our Manager. Depending on our Manager\u2019s perception of the relative risks\nand rewards of a particular asset, our Manager may elect to acquire interests in structures that afford relatively little or no operational and/or management control to us. Such arrangements present risks not present with wholly-owned assets, such as the possibility that a co-investor becomes bankrupt, develops business interests or goals that conflict with our interests and goals in respect of the assets, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our Manager expects to utilize third-party contractors to perform services and functions related to the operation and leasing of our assets. These functions may include billing, collections, recovery and asset monitoring. Because we and our Manager do not directly control these third parties, there can be no assurance that the services they provide will be delivered at a level commensurate with our expectations, or at all. The failure of any such third-party contractors to perform in accordance with our expectations could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the risks and costs of obsolescence of our assets.\nTechnological and other improvements expose us to the risk that certain of our assets may become technologically or commercially obsolete. For example, in our Aviation Leasing segment, as manufacturers introduce technological innovations and new types of aircraft, some of our assets could become less desirable to potential lessees. Such technological innovations may increase the rate of obsolescence of existing aircraft faster than currently anticipated by us. In addition, the imposition of increased regulation regarding stringent noise or emissions restrictions may make some of our aircraft less desirable and less valuable in the marketplace. In our offshore energy business, development and construction of new, sophisticated, high-specification assets could cause our assets to become less desirable to potential charterers, and insurance rates may also increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to potential charterers. Any of these risks may adversely affect our ability to lease, charter or sell our assets on favorable terms, if at all, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nThe North American rail sector is a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future laws, regulations and other requirements could significantly increase our operational costs of doing business, thereby adversely affecting our profitability.\nThe rail sector is subject to extensive laws, regulations and other requirements including, but not limited to, those relating to the environment, safety, rates and charges, service obligations, employment, labor, immigration, minimum wages and overtime pay, health care and benefits, working conditions, public accessibility and other requirements. These laws and regulations are enforced by U.S. federal agencies including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cU.S. EPA\u201d), the U.S. Department of Transportation (the \u201cDOT\u201d), the Occupational Safety and Health Act (the \u201cOSHA\u201d), the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration (the \u201cFRA\u201d), and the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (the \u201cSTB\u201d), as well as numerous other state, provincial, local and federal agencies. Ongoing compliance with, or a violation of, these laws, regulations and other requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that our rail operations are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations, and the interpretation or enforcement thereof, are subject to frequent change and varying interpretation by regulatory authorities, and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of these laws and regulations on our operations. In addition, from time to time we are subject to inspections and investigations by various regulators. Violation of environmental or other laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and construction bans or delays.\nLegislation passed by the U.S. Congress or Canadian Parliament or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of our business. For instance, more recently proposed bills such as the \u201cRail Shipper Fairness Act of 2017,\u201d or competitive access proposals under consideration by the STB, if adopted, could increase government involvement in railroad pricing, service and operations and significantly change the federal regulatory framework of the railroad industry. Several of the changes under consideration could have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to determine prices for rail services, meet service standards and could force a reduction in capital spending. Statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nUnder various U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local environmental requirements, as the owner or operator of terminals or other facilities, we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination at or from our existing locations, whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such contamination. The failure to timely report and properly remediate contamination may subject us to liability to third parties and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent our property or to borrow money using our property as collateral. Additionally, we may be liable for the costs of remediating third-party sites where hazardous substances from our operations have been transported for treatment or disposal, regardless of whether we own or operate that site. In the future, we may incur substantial expenditures for investigation or remediation of contamination that has not yet been discovered at our current or former locations or locations that we may acquire.\nA discharge of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment associated with operating our rail assets could subject us to substantial expense, including the cost to recover the materials spilled, restore the affected natural resources, pay fines and penalties, and natural resource damages and claims made by employees, neighboring landowners, government authorities and other third parties, including for personal injury and property damage. We may experience future catastrophic sudden or gradual releases into the environment from our facilities or discover historical releases that were previously unidentified or not assessed. Although our inspection and testing programs are designed to prevent, detect and address any\nsuch releases promptly, the liabilities incurred due to any future releases into the environment from our assets, have the potential to substantially affect our business. Such events could also subject us to media and public scrutiny that could have a negative effect on our operations and also on the value of our common shares.\nWe could be negatively impacted by environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability-related matters.\nGovernments, investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on corporate ESG practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving. We have announced, and may in the future announce, sustainability-focused investments, partnerships and other initiatives and goals. These initiatives, aspirations, targets or objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately report on these initiatives and goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material negative impact, including on our reputation and stock price.\nIn addition, the standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period. Moreover, our processes and controls may not always align with evolving voluntary standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. In this regard, the criteria by which our ESG practices and disclosures are assessed may change due to the quickly evolving landscape, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. The increasing attention to corporate ESG initiatives could also result in increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof. If we are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our ESG and sustainability practices are inadequate. If we fail or are perceived to have failed to achieve previously announced initiatives or goals or to accurately disclose our progress on such initiatives or goals, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe transport hazardous materials.\nWe transport certain hazardous materials and other materials, including crude oil and toxic inhalation hazard (TIH) materials, such as ammonia, that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion. Additionally, U.S. laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss. In addition, insurance premiums charged for, or the self-insured retention associated with, some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these materials. A rail accident or other incident or accident on our network, at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOur business could be adversely affected if service on the railroads is interrupted or if more stringent regulations are adopted regarding railcar design or the transportation of crude oil by rail.\nAs a result of hydraulic fracturing and other improvements in extraction technologies, there has been a substantial increase in the volume of crude oil and liquid hydrocarbons produced and transported in North America, and a geographic shift in that production versus historical production. The increase in volume and shift in geography has resulted in increased pipeline congestion and a corresponding growth in crude oil being transported by rail from Canada and across the U.S. High-profile accidents involving crude-oil-carrying trains in Quebec, North Dakota and Virginia, and more recently in Saskatchewan, West Virginia and Illinois, have raised concerns about derailments and the environmental and safety risks associated with crude oil transport by rail and the associated risks arising from railcar design. In Canada, the transport of hazardous products is receiving greater scrutiny which could impact our customers and our business.\nIn May 2015, the DOT issued new production standards and operational controls for rail tank cars used in \u201cHigh-Hazard Flammable Trains\u201d (i.e., trains carrying commodities such as ethanol, crude oil and other flammable liquids). Similar standards have been adopted in Canada. The new standard applies for all cars manufactured after October 1, 2015, and existing tank cars must be retrofitted within the next three to eight years. The applicable operational controls include reduced speed restrictions, and maximum lengths on trains carrying these materials. Retrofitting our tank cars will be required under these new standards to the extent we elect to move certain flammable liquids in the future. While we may be able to pass some of these costs on to our customers, there may be costs that we cannot pass on to them. We continue to monitor the railcar regulatory landscape and remain in close contact with railcar suppliers and other industry stakeholders to stay informed of railcar regulation rulemaking developments. It is unclear how these regulations will impact the crude-by-rail industry, and any such impact would depend on a number of factors that are outside of our control. If, for example, overall volume of crude-by-rail decreases, or if we do not have access to a sufficient number of compliant cars to transport required volumes under our existing contracts, our operations may be negatively affected. This may lead to a decrease in revenues and other consequences.\nThe adoption of additional federal, state, provincial or local laws or regulations, including any voluntary measures by the rail industry regarding railcar design or crude oil and liquid hydrocarbon rail transport activities, or efforts by local communities to restrict or limit rail traffic involving crude oil, could affect our business by increasing compliance costs and decreasing demand for our services, which could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows. Moreover, any disruptions in the operations of railroads, including those due to shortages of railcars, weather-related problems, flooding, drought, accidents, mechanical\ndifficulties, strikes, lockouts or bottlenecks, could adversely impact our customers\u2019 ability to move their product and, as a result, could affect our business.\nBecause we depend on Class I railroads for a significant portion of our operations in North America, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate.\nThe railroad industry in the United States and Canada is dominated by seven Class I carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage. In addition, Class I carriers also traditionally have been significant sources of business for us, and may be future sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines. A decision by any of these Class I carriers to cease or re-route certain freight movements or to alter existing business relationships, including operational or relationship changes, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The overall impact of any such decision would depend on which Class I carrier is involved, the routes and freight movements affected, as well as the nature of any changes.\nWe may be affected by fluctuating prices for fuel and energy.\nVolatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including, but not limited to: the economy; demand for transportation services; business related to the energy sector, including the production and processing of crude oil, natural gas, and coal; fuel prices; and, fuel surcharges. Particularly in our rail business, fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our expenses. Diesel fuel prices and availability can be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. If a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of oil imports or domestic oil production, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war, terrorist attack or otherwise, diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations. Currently, we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset fuel prices, although there may be a significant delay in our recovery of fuel costs based on the terms of the fuel surcharge program. If Class I railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges, the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease, which could have a negative effect on our profitability; in fact, we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through fuel surcharges at all, as future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges.\nInternational, political, and economic factors, events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies. Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. A severe shortage of, or disruption to, domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on commodities we process and transport, such as crude oil and petroleum products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nTranstar faces competition from other railroads and other transportation providers.\nTranstar faces competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ships, barges, and pipelines. We operate in some corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality, and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads. Motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service. However, railroads are much more fuel-efficient than trucks, which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure. Additionally, we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, while trucks, barges, and maritime operators are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our rail services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity: (i) improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, such as autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks, (ii) legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers, or (iii) legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic. Additionally, any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect our competitive environment.\nOur assets are exposed to unplanned interruptions caused by catastrophic events outside of our control which may disrupt our business and cause damage or losses that may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nThe operations of transportation and infrastructure projects are exposed to unplanned interruptions caused by significant catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides, floods, explosions, fires, derailments, major plant breakdowns, pipeline or electricity line ruptures or other disasters. Operational disruption, as well as supply disruption, and increased government oversight could adversely impact the cash flows available from these assets. In addition, the cost of repairing or replacing damaged assets could be considerable. Repeated or prolonged interruption may result in temporary or permanent loss of customers, substantial litigation or penalties for regulatory or contractual non-compliance, and any loss from such events may not be recoverable under relevant insurance policies. Although we believe that we are adequately insured against these types of events, either indirectly through our lessees or charterers or through our own insurance policies, no assurance can be given that the occurrence of any such event will not materially adversely affect us. In addition, if a lessee or charterer is not obligated to maintain sufficient insurance, we may incur the costs of additional insurance coverage during the related lease or charter. We can give no assurance that such insurance will be available at commercially reasonable rates, if at all.\nOur assets generally require routine maintenance, and we may be exposed to unforeseen maintenance costs.\nWe may be exposed to unforeseen maintenance costs for our assets associated with a lessee\u2019s or charterer\u2019s failure to properly maintain the asset. We enter into leases and charters with respect to some of our assets pursuant to which the lessees are primarily responsible for many obligations, which generally include complying with all governmental requirements applicable to the lessee or charterer, including operational, maintenance, government agency oversight, registration requirements and other applicable directives. Failure of a lessee or charterer to perform required maintenance during the term of a lease or charter could result in a decrease in value of an asset, an inability to re-lease or charter an asset at favorable rates, if at all, or a potential inability to utilize an asset. Maintenance failures would also likely require us to incur maintenance and modification costs upon the termination of the applicable lease or charter; such costs to restore the asset to an acceptable condition prior to re-leasing, charter or sale could be substantial. Any failure by our lessees or charterers to meet their obligations to perform required scheduled maintenance or our inability to maintain our assets could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our customers operate in highly regulated industries and changes in laws or regulations, including laws with respect to international trade, may adversely affect our ability to lease, charter or sell our assets.\nSome of our customers operate in highly regulated industries such as aviation and offshore energy. A number of our contractual arrangements-for example, our leasing aircraft engines or offshore energy equipment to third-party operators-require the operator (our customer) to obtain specific governmental or regulatory licenses, consents or approvals. These include consents for certain payments under such arrangements and for the export, import or re-export of the related assets. Failure by our customers or, in certain circumstances, by us, to obtain certain licenses and approvals could negatively affect our ability to conduct our business. In addition, the shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects the operation of our assets to international trade laws and regulations. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities. If any such regulations or sanctions affect the asset operators that are our customers, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nCertain of our assets are subject to purchase options held by the charterer or lessee of the asset which, if exercised, could reduce the size of our asset base and our future revenues.\nWe have granted purchase options to the charterers and lessees of certain of our assets. The market values of these assets may change from time to time depending on a number of factors, such as general economic and market conditions affecting the industries in which we operate, competition, cost of construction, governmental or other regulations, technological changes and prevailing levels of charter or lease rates from time to time. The purchase price under a purchase option may be less than the asset\u2019s market value at the time the option may be exercised. In addition, we may not be able to obtain a replacement asset for the price at which the asset is sold. In such cases, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nThe profitability of our offshore energy assets may be impacted by the profitability of the offshore oil and gas industry generally, which is significantly affected by, among other things, volatile oil and gas prices.\nDemand for assets in the offshore energy business and our ability to secure charter contracts for our assets at favorable charter rates following expiry or termination of existing charters will depend, among other things, on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry. The offshore oil and gas industry is cyclical and volatile, and demand for oil-service assets depends on, among other things, the level of development and activity in oil and gas exploration, as well as the identification and development of oil and gas reserves and production in offshore areas worldwide. The availability of high quality oil and gas prospects, exploration success, relative production costs, the stage of reservoir development, political concerns and regulatory requirements all affect the level of activity for charterers of oil-service vessels. Accordingly, oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices significantly affect the level of activity and demand for oil-service assets. Oil and gas prices can be extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, such as: worldwide demand for oil and gas; costs of exploring, developing, producing and delivering oil and gas; expectations regarding future energy prices; the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels and impact pricing; the level of production in non-OPEC countries; governmental regulations and policies regarding development of oil and gas reserves; local and international political, economic and weather conditions; domestic and foreign tax or trade policies; political and military conflicts in oil-producing and other countries; and the development and exploration of alternative fuels. Any reduction in the demand for our assets due to these or other factors could materially adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nWe may not be able to renew or obtain new or favorable charters or leases, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating leases are subject to greater residual risk than direct finance leases because we will own the assets at the expiration of an operating lease term and we may be unable to renew existing charters or leases at favorable rates, or at all, or sell the leased or chartered assets, and the residual value of the asset may be lower than anticipated. In addition, our ability to renew existing charters or leases or obtain new charters or leases will also depend on prevailing market conditions, and upon expiration of the contracts governing the leasing or charter of the applicable assets, we may be exposed to increased volatility in terms of rates and contract provisions. For example, we do not currently have long-term charters for our construction support vessel and our ROV support vessel. Likewise, our customers may reduce their activity levels or seek to terminate or renegotiate their charters or leases with us. If we are not able to renew or obtain new charters or leases in direct continuation, or if new charters or leases are entered into at rates substantially below the existing rates or on terms otherwise less favorable compared to existing contractual terms, or if we are unable to sell assets for which we are unable to obtain new contracts or leases, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nLitigation to enforce our contracts and recover our assets has inherent uncertainties that are increased by the location of our assets in jurisdictions that have less developed legal systems.\nWhile some of our contractual arrangements are governed by New York law and provide for the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the state of New York, our ability to enforce our counterparties\u2019 obligations under such contractual arrangements is subject to applicable laws in the jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. While some of our existing assets are used in specific jurisdictions, transportation and transportation-related infrastructure assets by their nature generally move throughout multiple jurisdictions in the ordinary course of business. As a result, it is not possible to predict, with any degree of certainty, the jurisdictions in which enforcement proceedings may be commenced. Litigation and enforcement proceedings have inherent uncertainties in any jurisdiction and are expensive. These uncertainties are enhanced in countries that have less developed legal systems where the interpretation of laws and regulations is not consistent, may be influenced by factors other than legal merits and may be cumbersome, time-consuming and even more expensive. For example, repossession from defaulting lessees may be difficult and more expensive in jurisdictions whose laws do not confer the same security interests and rights to creditors and lessors as those in the United States and where the legal system is not as well developed. As a result, the remedies available and the relative success and expedience of collection and enforcement proceedings with respect to the owned assets in various jurisdictions cannot be predicted. To the extent more of our business shifts to areas outside of the United States and Europe, such as Asia and the Middle East, it may become more difficult and expensive to enforce our rights and recover our assets.\nOur international operations involve additional risks, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and our customers operate in various regions throughout the world. As a result, we may, directly or indirectly, be exposed to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:\n\u2022terrorist acts, armed hostilities, war and civil disturbances;\n\u2022acts of piracy;\n\u2022potential cybersecurity attacks;\n\u2022significant governmental influence over many aspects of local economies;\n\u2022seizure, nationalization or expropriation of property or equipment;\n\u2022repudiation, nullification, modification or renegotiation of contracts;\n\u2022limitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas;\n\u2022political unrest;\n\u2022foreign and U.S. monetary policy and foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations;\n\u2022the inability to repatriate income or capital;\n\u2022complications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations;\n\u2022import-export quotas, wage and price controls, imposition of trade barriers;\n\u2022U.S. and foreign sanctions or trade embargoes;\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of countries in which we operate;\n\u2022compliance with U.S. Treasury sanctions regulations restricting doing business with certain nations or specially designated nationals;\n\u2022regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;\n\u2022compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations;\n\u2022changing taxation policies, including confiscatory taxation;\n\u2022other forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control; and\n\u2022governmental corruption.\nAny of these or other risks could adversely impact our customers\u2019 international operations which could materially adversely impact our operating results and growth opportunities.\nWe may make acquisitions in emerging markets throughout the world, and investments in emerging markets are subject to greater risks than developed markets and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTo the extent that we acquire assets in emerging markets-which we may do throughout the world-additional risks may be encountered that could adversely affect our business. Emerging market countries have less developed economies and infrastructure and are often more vulnerable to economic and geopolitical challenges and may experience significant fluctuations in gross domestic product, interest rates and currency exchange rates, as well as civil disturbances, government instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets and the imposition of taxes or other charges by government authorities. In addition, the currencies in which investments are denominated may be unstable, may be subject to significant depreciation and may not be freely convertible or may be subject to the imposition of other monetary or fiscal controls and restrictions.\nEmerging markets are still in relatively early stages of their development and accordingly may not be highly or efficiently regulated. Moreover, emerging markets tend to be shallower and less liquid than more established markets which may adversely affect our ability to realize profits from our assets in emerging markets when we desire to do so or receive what we perceive to be their fair value in the event of a realization. In some cases, a market for realizing profits from an investment may not exist locally. In addition, issuers based in emerging markets are not generally subject to uniform accounting and financial reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to issuers based in more developed countries, thereby potentially increasing the risk of fraud and other deceptive practices. Settlement of transactions may be subject to greater delay and administrative uncertainties than in developed markets and less complete and reliable financial and other information may be available to investors in emerging markets than in developed markets. In addition, economic instability in emerging markets could adversely affect the value of our assets subject to leases or charters in such countries, or the ability of our lessees or charters, which operate in these markets, to meet their contractual obligations. As a result, lessees or charterers that operate in emerging market countries may be more likely to default under their contractual obligations than those that operate in developed countries. Liquidity and volatility limitations in these markets may also adversely affect our ability to dispose of our assets at the best price available or in a timely manner.\nAs we have and may continue to acquire assets located in emerging markets throughout the world, we may be exposed to any one or a combination of these risks, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are actively evaluating potential acquisitions of assets and operating companies in other transportation and infrastructure sectors which could result in additional risks and uncertainties for our business and unexpected regulatory compliance costs.\nWhile our existing portfolio consists of assets in the aviation, energy, intermodal transport and port and rail sectors, we are actively evaluating potential acquisitions of assets and operating companies in other sectors of the transportation and transportation-related infrastructure and equipment markets and we plan to be flexible as other attractive opportunities arise over time. To the extent we make acquisitions in other sectors, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with the required investment of capital and other resources and with combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. Many types of transportation assets, including certain rail, airport and seaport assets, are subject to registration requirements by U.S. governmental agencies, as well as foreign governments if such assets are to be used outside of the United States. Failing to register the assets, or losing such registration, could result in substantial penalties, forced liquidation of the assets and/or the inability to operate and, if applicable, lease the assets. We may need to incur significant costs to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to any such new acquisition. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs, fines or penalties or require the assets to be removed from service for a period of time resulting in reduced income from these assets. In addition, if our acquisitions in other sectors produce insufficient revenues, or produce investment losses, or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected, and our reputation and business may be harmed.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, reducing operational flexibility and creating default risks.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness, including, but not limited to, the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the revolving credit facility entered into on June 16, 2017 (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. The indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility restrict among other things, our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022merge, consolidate or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets;\n\u2022incur additional debt or issue preferred shares;\n\u2022make certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022create liens on our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022make distributions on or repurchase our shares;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022create dividend restrictions and other payment restrictions that affect our subsidiaries.\nThese covenants could impair our ability to grow our business, take advantage of attractive business opportunities or successfully compete. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default. Cross-default provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or holders thereof could elect to declare all outstanding debt under such agreements to be immediately due and payable.\nTerrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and our profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.\nTerrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations. Such attacks have contributed to economic instability in the United States and elsewhere, and further acts of terrorism, violence or war could similarly affect world trade and the industries in which we and our customers operate. In addition, terrorist attacks or hostilities may directly impact airports or aircraft, ports where our containers and vessels travel, or our physical facilities or those of our customers. In addition, it is also possible that our assets could be involved in a terrorist attack. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Although our lease and charter agreements generally require the counterparties to indemnify us against all damages arising out of the use of our assets, and we carry insurance to potentially offset any costs in the event that our customer indemnifications prove to be insufficient, our insurance does not cover certain types of terrorist attacks, and we may not be fully protected from liability or the reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes our assets.\nOur leases and charters require payments in U.S. dollars, but many of our customers operate in other currencies; if foreign currencies devalue against the U.S. dollar, our lessees or charterers may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner.\nOur current leases and charters require that payments be made in U.S. dollars. If the currency that our lessees or charterers typically use in operating their businesses devalues against the U.S. dollar, our lessees or charterers could encounter difficulties in making payments to us in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, many foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating international payments that may impede or prevent payments from being paid to us in U.S. dollars. Future leases or charters may provide for payments to be made in euros or other foreign currencies. Any change in the currency exchange rate that reduces the amount of U.S. dollars obtained by us upon conversion of future lease payments denominated in euros or other foreign currencies, may, if not appropriately hedged by us, have a material adverse effect on us and increase the volatility of our earnings.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient capital would constrain our ability to grow our portfolio and to increase our revenues.\nOur business is capital intensive, and we have used and may continue to employ leverage to finance our operations. Accordingly, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and maintain our operations depends on the availability and cost of debt and equity capital. Additionally, our ability to borrow against our assets is dependent, in part, on the appraised value of such assets. If the appraised value of such assets declines, we may be required to reduce the principal outstanding under our debt facilities or otherwise be unable to incur new borrowings.\nWe can give no assurance that the capital we need will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain sufficient capital, or to renew or expand our credit facilities, could result in increased funding costs and would limit our ability to:\n\u2022meet the terms and maturities of our existing and future debt facilities;\n\u2022purchase new assets or refinance existing assets;\n\u2022fund our working capital needs and maintain adequate liquidity; and\n\u2022finance other growth initiatives.\nIn addition, we conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). As such, certain forms of financing such as finance leases may not be available to us. Please see \u201c- If we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d\nThe effects of various environmental regulations may negatively affect the industries in which we operate which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants to air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and noise and emission levels and greenhouse gas emissions. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, strict liability may be imposed on the owners or operators of assets, which could render us liable for environmental and natural resource damages without regard to negligence or fault on our part. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessee\u2019s or charterer\u2019s current or historical operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a variety of new legislation is being enacted, or considered for enactment, at the federal, state and local levels relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. While there has historically been a lack of consistent climate change legislation, as climate change concerns continue to grow, further legislation and regulations are\nexpected to continue in areas such as greenhouse gas emissions control, emission disclosure requirements and building codes or other infrastructure requirements that impose energy efficiency standards. Government mandates, standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce greenhouse gas emissions or projected climate change impacts could result in prohibitions or severe restrictions on infrastructure development in certain areas, increased energy and transportation costs, and increased compliance expenses and other financial obligations to meet permitting or development requirements that we may be unable to fully recover (due to market conditions or other factors), any of which could result in reduced profits and adversely affect our results of operations. While we typically maintain liability insurance coverage and typically require our lessees to provide us with indemnity against certain losses, the insurance coverage is subject to large deductibles, limits on maximum coverage and significant exclusions and may not be sufficient or available to protect against any or all liabilities and such indemnities may not cover or be sufficient to protect us against losses arising from environmental damage. In addition, changes to environmental standards or regulations in the industries in which we operate could limit the economic life of the assets we acquire or reduce their value, and also require us to make significant additional investments in order to maintain compliance, which would negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur Repauno site and Long Ridge property are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur Repauno site is subject to ongoing environmental investigation and remediation by the former owner that sold Repauno to us (the \u201cRepauno Seller\u201d) related to historic industrial operations. The Repauno Seller is responsible for completion of this work, and we benefit from a related indemnity and insurance policy. If the Repauno Seller fails to fulfill its investigation and remediation, or indemnity obligations and the related insurance, which are subject to limits and conditions, fail to cover our costs, we could incur losses. Redevelopment of the property in those areas undergoing investigation and remediation must await state environmental agency confirmation that no further investigation or remediation is required before redevelopment activities can occur in such areas of the property. Therefore, any delay in the Repauno Seller\u2019s completion of the environmental work or receipt of related approvals in an area of the property could delay our redevelopment activities. In addition, once received, permits and approvals may be subject to litigation, and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed or modified in litigation. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approval, it could delay projects and cause us to incur costs.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Long Ridge, the former owner that sold Long Ridge to us (the \u201cLong Ridge Seller\u201d) is obligated to perform certain post-closing demolition activities, remove specified containers, equipment and structures and conduct investigation, removal, cleanup and decontamination related thereto. The Long Ridge Seller is responsible for ongoing environmental remediation related to historic industrial operations on and off Long Ridge. In addition, Long Ridge is located adjacent to the former Ormet Corporation Superfund site (the \u201cOrmet site\u201d), which is owned and operated by the Long Ridge Seller. Pursuant to an order with the U.S. EPA, the Long Ridge Seller is obligated to pump groundwater that has been impacted by the adjacent Ormet site beneath our site and discharge it to the Ohio River and monitor the groundwater annually. Long Ridge is also subject to an environmental covenant related to the adjacent Ormet site that, inter alia, restricts the use of groundwater beneath our site and requires U.S. EPA consent for activities on Long Ridge that could disrupt the groundwater monitoring or pumping. The Long Ridge Seller is contractually obligated to complete its regulatory obligations on Long Ridge and we benefit from a related indemnity and insurance policy. If the Long Ridge Seller fails to fulfill its demolition, removal, investigation, remediation, monitoring, or indemnity obligations, and if the related insurance, which is subject to limits and conditions, fails to cover our costs, we could incur losses. Redevelopment of the property in those areas undergoing investigation and remediation pursuant to the Ohio EPA order must await state environmental agency confirmation that no further investigation or remediation is required before redevelopment activities can occur in such area of the property. Therefore, any delay in the Long Ridge Seller\u2019s completion of the environmental work or receipt of related approvals or consents from Ohio EPA or U.S. EPA could delay our redevelopment activities.\nIn addition, a portion of Long Ridge was recently redeveloped as a combined cycle gas-fired electric generating facility, and other portions will likely be redeveloped in the future. Although we have not identified material impacts to soils or groundwater that reasonably would be expected to prevent or delay further redevelopment projects, impacted materials could be encountered that require special handling and/or result in delays to those projects. Any additional projects may require environmental permits and approvals from federal, state and local environmental agencies. Once received, permits and approvals may be subject to litigation, and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed or modified in litigation. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approval, it could delay projects and cause us to incur costs.\nMoreover, new, stricter environmental laws, regulations or enforcement policies, including those imposed in response to climate change, could be implemented that significantly increase our compliance costs, or require us to adopt more costly methods of operation. If we are not able to transform Repauno or Long Ridge into hubs for industrial and energy development in a timely manner, their future prospects could be materially and adversely affected, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe discontinuation of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may have an impact on our business.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, or the IBA, the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of LIBOR on December 31, 2021, for only the one-week and two-month LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023, for all other LIBOR tenors. The U.S. Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the IBA Benchmark Administration\nconfirmed its intention to cease publication of (i) one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings after December 31, 2021 and (ii) the remaining USD LIBOR settings after June 30, 2023.\nIn the United States, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a group of diverse private-market participants assembled by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was tasked with identifying alternative reference rates to replace LIBOR. The Secured Overnight Finance Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) has emerged as the ARRC's preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other alternative reference rates.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $315.0 million of total debt outstanding under facilities with interest rates based on floating-rate indices. As a result of LIBOR\u2019s phase out, our revolving credit facility was amended to incorporate SOFR as the successor rate to LIBOR, and our December 2021 bridge loan bears interest based on SOFR. There are significant differences between how LIBOR and SOFR are calculated, which could result in increased borrowing costs. We cannot predict to what extent the withdrawal and replacement of LIBOR will impact us. However, the implementation of alternative underlying floating-rate indices and reference rates may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA cyberattack that bypasses our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d), security systems or the IT security systems of our third-party providers, causing an IT security breach, may lead to a disruption of our IT systems and the loss of business information which may hinder our ability to conduct our business effectively and may result in lost revenues and additional costs.\nParts of our business depend on the secure operation of our IT systems and the IT systems of our third-party providers to manage, process, store, and transmit information associated with aircraft leasing. We have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks. A cyberattack that bypasses our IT security systems or the IT security systems of our third-party providers, causing an IT security breach, could adversely impact our daily operations and lead to the loss of sensitive information, including our own proprietary information and that of our customers, suppliers and employees. Such losses could harm our reputation and result in competitive disadvantages, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, lost revenues, additional costs and liabilities. While we devote substantial resources to maintaining adequate levels of cyber-security, our resources and technical sophistication may not be adequate to prevent all types of cyberattacks.\nIf we are deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the term \u201cinvestment securities,\u201d among other things, are U.S. government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company for certain privately-offered investment vehicles set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.\nWe are a holding company that is not an investment company because we are engaged in the business of holding securities of our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, which are engaged in transportation and related businesses which lease assets pursuant to operating leases and finance leases. The Investment Company Act may limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to enter into financing leases and engage in other types of financial activity because less than 40% of the value of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis can consist of \u201cinvestment securities.\u201d\nIf we or any of our subsidiaries were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, the registered entity would become subject to substantial regulation that would significantly change our operations, and we would not be able to conduct our business as described in this report. We have not obtained a formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the Investment Company Act and, consequently, any violation of the Investment Company Act would subject us to material adverse consequences.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition of Transtar, LLC\nOur acquisition of Transtar, LLC (\u201cTranstar\u201d) may not achieve its intended results and we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of Transtar.\nOn July 28, 2021, we completed our previously announced acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Transtar (the \u201cTranstar Acquisition\u201d), a wholly-owned short-line railroad subsidiary of United States Steel Corporation (the \u201cSeller\u201d). Transtar is comprised of five short-line freight railroads and one switching company, including two that connect to Seller\u2019s largest production facilities in North America: the Gary Railway Company, Indiana; The Lake Terminal Railroad Company, Ohio; Union Railroad Company LLC, Pennsylvania; Fairfield Southern Company Inc., Alabama (switching company); Delray Connecting Railroad Company, Michigan; and the Texas & Northern Railroad Company, Texas. We are subject to certain risks relating to the Transtar\nAcquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such risks may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022failure to successfully integrate Transtar in a manner that permits us to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition;\n\u2022difficulties and delays integrating Transtar\u2019s personnel, operations and systems and retaining key employees;\n\u2022higher than anticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the business and operations of Transtar;\n\u2022challenges in operating and managing rail lines across geographically disparate regions;\n\u2022disruptions to our ongoing business and diversions of our management\u2019s attention caused by transition or integration activities involving Transtar;\n\u2022challenges with implementing adequate and appropriate controls, procedures and policies in Transtar\u2019s business;\n\u2022Transtar\u2019s dependence on the Seller as its primary customer;\n\u2022difficulties expanding our customer base;\n\u2022difficulties arising from Transtar\u2019s dependence on the Seller to provide a variety of necessary transition services to Transtar and any failure by the Seller to adequately provide such services;\n\u2022assumption of pre-existing contractual relationships of Transtar that we may not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business;\n\u2022incurring debt to finance the Transtar Acquisition, which increased our debt service requirements, expense and leverage;\n\u2022any potential litigation arising from the transaction; and\n\u2022other risks described in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe successful integration of a new business also depends on our ability to manage the new business, realize forecasted synergies and full value from the combined business. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate Transtar.\nWe have material customer concentration with respect to the Transtar business, with a limited number of customers accounting for a material portion of our revenues.\nWe earned approximately 12% of our revenue from one customer in the Transtar segment during the year ended December 31, 2021 (based on our period of ownership of Transtar).\nThere are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of customers. It is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our services that will be generated by these customers or the future demand for the products and services of these customers in the end-user marketplace. In addition, revenues from these customers may fluctuate from time to time based on the commencement and completion of projects, the timing of which may be affected by market conditions or other factors, some of which may be outside of our control. If any of these customers experience declining or delayed sales due to market, economic or competitive conditions, we could be pressured to reduce the prices we charge for our services or we could lose a major customer. Any such development could have an adverse effect on our margins and financial position, and would negatively affect our revenues and results of operations and/or trading price of our shares.\nRisks Related to Our Manager\nWe are dependent on our Manager and other key personnel at Fortress and may not find suitable replacements if our Manager terminates the Management Agreement or if other key personnel depart.\nOur officers and other individuals who perform services for us (other than Aviation, Jefferson, Repauno, Long Ridge and Transtar employees) are employees of our Manager or other Fortress entities. We are completely reliant on our Manager, which has significant discretion as to the implementation of our operating policies and strategies, to conduct our business. We are subject to the risk that our Manager will terminate the Management Agreement and that we will not be able to find a suitable replacement for our Manager in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost, or at all. Furthermore, we are dependent on the services of certain key employees of our Manager and certain key employees of Fortress entities whose compensation is partially or entirely dependent upon the amount of management fees earned by our Manager or the incentive allocations distributed to the General Partner and whose continued service is not guaranteed, and the loss of such personnel or services could materially adversely affect our operations. We do not have key man insurance for any of the personnel of the Manager or other Fortress entities that are key to us. An inability to find a suitable replacement for any departing employee of our Manager or Fortress entities on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our ability to operate and grow our business.\nIn addition, our Manager may assign our Management Agreement to an entity whose business and operations are managed or supervised by Mr. Wesley R. Edens, who is a principal, Co-Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors of Fortress, an affiliate of our Manager, and a member of the management committee of Fortress since co-founding Fortress in May 1998. In the event of any such assignment to a non-affiliate of Fortress, the functions currently performed by our Manager\u2019s current personnel may be performed by others. We can give you no assurance that such personnel would manage our\noperations in the same manner as our Manager currently does, and the failure by the personnel of any such entity to acquire assets generating attractive risk-adjusted returns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 27, 2017, SoftBank completed its acquisition of Fortress (the \u201cSoftBank Merger\u201d). In connection with the SoftBank Merger, Fortress operates within SoftBank as an independent business headquartered in New York.\nThere are conflicts of interest in our relationship with our Manager.\nOur Management Agreement, the Partnership Agreement and our operating agreement were negotiated prior to our IPO and among affiliated parties, and their terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated after our IPO with an unaffiliated third-party.\nThere are conflicts of interest inherent in our relationship with our Manager insofar as our Manager and its affiliates - including investment funds, private investment funds, or businesses managed by our Manager, including Seacastle Inc., Florida East Coast Industries, LLC (\u201cFECI\u201d) and FYX Trust Holdco LLC (\u201cFYX\u201d) - invest in transportation and transportation-related infrastructure assets and whose investment objectives overlap with our asset acquisition objectives. Certain opportunities appropriate for us may also be appropriate for one or more of these other investment vehicles. Certain members of our board of directors and employees of our Manager who are our officers also serve as officers and/or directors of these other entities. For example, we have some of the same directors and officers as Seacastle Inc. and FYX. Although we have the same Manager, we may compete with entities affiliated with our Manager or Fortress, including Seacastle Inc., FECI and FYX, for certain target assets. From time to time, affiliates of Fortress focus on investments in assets with a similar profile as our target assets that we may seek to acquire. These affiliates may have meaningful purchasing capacity, which may change over time depending upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, available equity capital and debt financing, market conditions and cash on hand. Fortress has multiple existing and planned funds focused on investing in one or more of our target sectors, each with significant current or expected capital commitments. We have previously purchased and may in the future purchase assets from these funds, and have previously co-invested and may in the future co-invest with these funds in transportation and transportation-related infrastructure assets. Fortress funds generally have a fee structure similar to ours, but the fees actually paid will vary depending on the size, terms and performance of each fund.\nOur Management Agreement generally does not limit or restrict our Manager or its affiliates from engaging in any business or managing other pooled investment vehicles that invest in assets that meet our asset acquisition objectives. Our Manager intends to engage in additional transportation and infrastructure related management and other investment opportunities in the future, including, but not limited to, a potential spin-off of our infrastructure business, which may compete with us for investments or result in a change in our current investment strategy. In addition, our operating agreement provides that if Fortress or an affiliate or any of their officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our shareholders or our affiliates. In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of Fortress or its affiliates acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person\u2019s capacity as a director or officer of FTAI and such person acts in good faith, then to the fullest extent permitted by law such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person\u2019s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us if Fortress or its affiliates pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if such person did not present the corporate opportunity to us.\nThe ability of our Manager and its officers and employees to engage in other business activities, subject to the terms of our Management Agreement, may reduce the amount of time our Manager, its officers or other employees spend managing us. In addition, we may engage (subject to our strategy) in material transactions with our Manager or another entity managed by our Manager or one of its affiliates, including Seacastle Inc., FECI and FYX, which may include, but are not limited to, certain acquisitions, financing arrangements, purchases of debt, co-investments, consumer loans, servicing advances and other assets that present an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest. Our board of directors adopted a policy regarding the approval of any \u201crelated person transactions\u201d pursuant to which certain of the material transactions described above may require disclosure to, and approval by, the independent members of our board of directors. Actual, potential or perceived conflicts have given, and may in the future give, rise to investor dissatisfaction, litigation or regulatory inquiries or enforcement actions. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including causing an inability to raise additional funds, a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us, a decrease in the prices of our equity securities and a resulting increased risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nThe structure of our Manager\u2019s and the General Partner\u2019s compensation arrangements may have unintended consequences for us. We have agreed to pay our Manager a management fee and the General Partner is entitled to receive incentive allocations from Holdco that are each based on different measures of performance. Consequently, there may be conflicts in the incentives of our Manager to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for us. In addition, because the General Partner and our Manager are both affiliates of Fortress, the Income Incentive Allocation paid to the General Partner may cause our Manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of earnings, including through the use of leverage, at the expense of other objectives, such as preservation of capital, to achieve higher incentive allocations. Investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or\nmore speculative than investments with lower yield potential. This could result in increased risk to the value of our portfolio of assets and our common shares.\nOur directors have approved a broad asset acquisition strategy for our Manager and will not approve each acquisition we make at the direction of our Manager. In addition, we may change our strategy without a shareholder vote, which may result in our acquiring assets that are different, riskier or less profitable than our current assets.\nOur Manager is authorized to follow a broad asset acquisition strategy. We may pursue other types of acquisitions as market conditions evolve. Our Manager makes decisions about our investments in accordance with broad investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors. Accordingly, we may, without a shareholder vote, change our target sectors and acquire a variety of assets that differ from, and are possibly riskier than, our current asset portfolio. Consequently, our Manager has great latitude in determining the types and categories of assets it may decide are proper investments for us, including the latitude to invest in types and categories of assets that may differ from those in our existing portfolio. Our directors will periodically review our strategy and our portfolio of assets. However, our board will not review or pre-approve each proposed acquisition or our related financing arrangements. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, the directors will rely primarily on information provided to them by our Manager. Furthermore, transactions entered into by our Manager may be difficult or impossible to reverse by the time they are reviewed by the directors even if the transactions contravene the terms of the Management Agreement. In addition, we may change our asset acquisition strategy, including our target asset classes, without a shareholder vote.\nOur asset acquisition strategy may evolve in light of existing market conditions and investment opportunities, and this evolution may involve additional risks depending upon the nature of the assets we target and our ability to finance such assets on a short or long-term basis. As part of our continuing efforts to provide value to our shareholders, we are currently considering a spin-off of our infrastructure business from the remainder of our asset portfolio. Our board has not formally evaluated any such transaction, and there can be no assurance as to the timing, terms, structure or completion of any such transaction. Any such transaction would be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, could have tax implications for the holders of our common shares, and could adversely affect the price of our common shares and our liquidity. Opportunities that present unattractive risk-return profiles relative to other available opportunities under particular market conditions may become relatively attractive under changed market conditions and changes in market conditions may therefore result in changes in the assets we target. Decisions to make acquisitions in new asset categories present risks that may be difficult for us to adequately assess and could therefore reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends on our common shares or have adverse effects on our liquidity or financial condition. A change in our asset acquisition strategy may also increase our exposure to interest rate, foreign currency or credit market fluctuations. In addition, a change in our asset acquisition strategy may increase our use of non-match-funded financing, increase the guarantee obligations we agree to incur or increase the number of transactions we enter into with affiliates. Our failure to accurately assess the risks inherent in new asset categories or the financing risks associated with such assets could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur Manager will not be liable to us for any acts or omissions performed in accordance with the Management Agreement, including with respect to the performance of our assets.\nPursuant to our Management Agreement, our Manager will not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder in good faith and will not be responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. Our Manager, its members, managers, officers, employees, sub-advisers and any other person controlling or Manager, will not be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries, to our board of directors, or our or any subsidiary\u2019s shareholders or partners for any acts or omissions by our Manager, its members, managers, officers, employees, sub-advisers and any other person controlling or Manager, except liability to us, our shareholders, directors, officers and employees and persons controlling us, by reason of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our Manager\u2019s duties under our Management Agreement. We will, to the full extent lawful, reimburse, indemnify and hold our Manager, its members, managers, officers and employees, sub-advisers and each other person, if any, controlling our Manager harmless of and from any and all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims of any nature whatsoever (including attorneys\u2019 fees) in respect of or arising from any acts or omissions of an indemnified party made in good faith in the performance of our Manager\u2019s duties under our Management Agreement and not constituting such indemnified party\u2019s bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our Manager\u2019s duties under our Management Agreement.\nOur Manager\u2019s due diligence of potential asset acquisitions or other transactions may not identify all pertinent risks, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur Manager intends to conduct due diligence with respect to each asset acquisition opportunity or other transaction it pursues. It is possible, however, that our Manager\u2019s due diligence processes will not uncover all relevant facts, particularly with respect to any assets we acquire from third parties. In these cases, our Manager may be given limited access to information about the asset and will rely on information provided by the seller of the asset. In addition, if asset acquisition opportunities are scarce, the process for selecting bidders is competitive, or the timeframe in which we are required to complete diligence is short, our ability to conduct a due diligence investigation may be limited, and we would be required to make decisions based upon a less thorough diligence process than would otherwise be the case. Accordingly, transactions that initially appear to be viable may prove not to be over time, due to the limitations of the due diligence process or other factors.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nShareholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their share of our taxable income, regardless of whether they receive any cash distributions from us.\nSo long as we would not be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 if we were a U.S. Corporation and 90% of our gross income for each taxable year constitutes \u201cqualifying income\u201d within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), on a continuing basis, FTAI will be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a partnership and not as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. Holders of our common shares may be subject to U.S. federal, state, local and, in some cases, non-U.S. income taxation on their allocable share of our items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (including our allocable share of those items of Holdco or any other entity in which we invest that is treated as a partnership or is otherwise subject to tax on a flow through basis) for each of our taxable years ending with or within their taxable year, regardless of whether they receive cash distributions from us. Such shareholders may not receive cash distributions equal to their allocable share of our net taxable income or even the tax liability that results from that income.\nWe may hold or acquire certain investments through entities classified as CFCs or PFICs for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nMany of our investments are in non-U.S. corporations or are held through non-U.S. subsidiaries that are classified as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Some of these foreign entities may be classified as controlled foreign corporations (\u201cCFCs\u201d) or passive foreign investment companies (\u201cPFICs\u201d) (each as defined in the Code). Shareholders subject to U.S. federal income tax may experience adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences related to the indirect ownership of CFC or PFIC shares. For example, such shareholders may be required to take into account U.S. taxable income with respect to such CFCs or PFICs without a corresponding receipt of cash from us. In addition, under the CFC rules, certain capital gains are treated as ordinary dividend income and certain shareholders could be subject to income inclusions in respect of the \u201csubpart F income\u201d and \"global intangible low-taxed income\" (\u201cGILTI\u201d) of the CFC. Treasury regulations, which are already effective with respect to GILTI and that will generally be effective beginning in 2023 with respect to subpart F income, generally have the effect of limiting certain adverse consequences of the CFC rules to shareholders treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as owning indirectly or constructively (including through other partnerships) stock possessing less than 10% of the voting power or value of such CFCs through their ownership in FTAI.\nUnder the PFIC rules, indirect ownership of PFIC shares by U.S. persons generally gives rise to materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, which may be mitigated by electing to treat the PFIC as a qualified electing fund (\u201cQEF\u201d). We currently anticipate using commercially reasonable efforts to make such an election (a \u201cQEF Election\u201d) with respect to each PFIC in which we hold a material interest, directly or indirectly, in the first year during which we hold shares in such entity, provided such PFIC is not also a CFC. As a result, U.S. holders of our common shares will generally be subject to tax on a current basis on their respective shares of each such PFIC\u2019s undistributed ordinary earnings and net capital gains for each year in which the entity is a PFIC, regardless of whether such holders receive a corresponding distribution of cash from us. In certain cases, however, we may be unable to make a QEF Election with respect to a PFIC because, for example, we are unable to obtain the necessary information. In such event, U.S. holders of our common shares will be subject to imputed interest charges and other disadvantageous tax treatment with respect to certain \u201cexcess distributions\u201d from the PFIC and gain realized upon the direct or indirect sale of the PFIC (including through the sale our common shares). Treasury Regulations have been proposed that would require partners in a partnership - rather than the partnership itself - to make a QEF election with respect to stock of a PFIC held indirectly through a partnership, if a partner so chooses. A partner that makes such an election generally would be subject to tax on a current basis on its share of such PFIC\u2019s undistributed ordinary earnings and net capital gains for each year in which the entity is a PFIC, regardless of whether such holders receive a corresponding distribution of cash from the PFIC or from us. In addition, under the proposed regulations, the PFIC rules would apply with respect to a partner\u2019s indirect interest in a PFIC that is held through a partnership even if such entity is also a CFC with respect to the partnership. As a result, if finalized in substantially their current form, these regulations would generally result in the PFIC rules applying to FTAI investors with respect to foreign corporations that are majority- or wholly-owned by us.\nProspective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential impact of the rules regarding CFCs and PFICs before investing in our shares.\nCertain tax consequences of the ownership of our preferred shares, including treatment of distributions as guaranteed payments for the use of capital, are uncertain.\nThe tax treatment of distributions on our preferred shares is uncertain. We intend to treat the holders of our preferred shares as partners for tax purposes and we intend to treat distributions on the shares as guaranteed payments for the use of capital that will generally be taxable to the holders of our preferred shares as ordinary income. Although a holder of our preferred shares will recognize taxable income from the accrual of such a guaranteed payment (even in the absence of a contemporaneous cash distribution), we anticipate accruing and making the guaranteed payment distributions quarterly. Except in the case of any loss recognized in connection with our liquidation, we do not anticipate allocating any items of our income, gain, loss or deduction to holders of our preferred shares, nor do we anticipate allocating them any share of our nonrecourse liabilities. If our preferred shares were treated as indebtedness for tax purposes, rather than as guaranteed payments for the use of capital, distributions in respect of the preferred coupon likely would be treated as payments of interest by us to the holders of our preferred shares.\nFinally, if holders of our preferred shares were entitled to an allocation of income from FTAI, the risk factors applicable to holders of common shares would generally apply.\nShareholders that are not U.S. persons could be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including a 10% withholding tax, on the disposition of our shares.\nIf the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) were to determine that we, Holdco, or any other entity in which we invest that is subject to tax on a flow-through basis, is engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any gain recognized by a foreign transferor on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our shares would generally be treated as \u201ceffectively connected\u201d with such trade or business to the extent it does not exceed the effectively connected gain that would be allocable to the transferor if we sold all of our assets at their fair market value as of the date of the transferor\u2019s disposition. Under current law, any such gain that is treated as effectively connected will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax. In addition, after December 31, 2022, certain brokers effecting transfers of our shares are required to deduct and withhold a tax equal to 10% of the amount realized by the transferor on the disposition, which would include an allocable portion of our liabilities and would therefore generally exceed the amount of transferred cash received by transferor in the disposition, unless the transferor provides an IRS Form W-9 or an affidavit stating the transferor\u2019s taxpayer identification number and that the transferor is not a foreign person or certain exceptions apply. Additionally, we (or certain qualified intermediaries) may be required to deduct and withhold certain amounts with respect to distributions to the transferees of our shares. Although we do not believe that we are currently engaged in a U.S. trade or business (directly or indirectly through pass-through subsidiaries), we are not required to manage our operations in a manner that is intended to avoid the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.\nTax gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of our common shares could be more or less than expected.\nIf a sale of our common shares by a shareholder is taxable in the United States, the shareholder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized by such shareholder in the sale and such shareholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in those shares. A shareholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares at the time of sale will generally be lower than the shareholder\u2019s original tax basis in the shares to the extent that prior distributions to such shareholder exceed the total taxable income allocated to such shareholder or in certain other instances. A shareholder may therefore recognize a gain in a sale of our common shares even if the shares are sold at a price that is less than their original cost. A portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be treated as ordinary income to such shareholder.\nOur ability to make distributions depends on our receiving sufficient cash distributions from our subsidiaries, and we cannot assure our shareholders that we will be able to make cash distributions to them in amounts that are sufficient to fund their tax liabilities.\nOur subsidiaries may be subject to local taxes in each of the relevant territories and jurisdictions in which they operate, including taxes on income, profits or gains and withholding taxes. As a result, our funds available for distribution are indirectly reduced by such taxes, and the post-tax return to our shareholders is similarly reduced by such taxes.\nIn general, a shareholder that is subject to U.S. federal income tax must include in income its allocable share of FTAI\u2019s items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit (including, so long as Holdco is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, FTAI\u2019s allocable share of those items of Holdco and any pass-through subsidiaries of Holdco) for each of our taxable years ending with or within such shareholder\u2019s taxable year. However, the cash distributed by FTAI to a shareholder may not be sufficient to pay the full amount of such shareholder\u2019s tax liability in respect of its investment in us.\nIf we are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the value of the shares could be adversely affected.\nWe have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or on any other matter affecting us. As of the date of the consummation of our initial public offering, under then current law and assuming full compliance with the terms of our operating agreement (and other relevant documents) and based upon factual statements and representations made by us, our outside counsel opined that we will be treated as a partnership, and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, opinions of counsel are not binding upon the IRS or any court, and the IRS may challenge this conclusion and a court may sustain such a challenge. The factual representations made by us upon which our outside counsel relied relate to our organization, operation, assets, activities, income, and present and future conduct of our operations. In general, if an entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a \u201cpublicly traded partnership\u201d (as defined in the Code) it will be nonetheless treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless the exception described below, and upon which we intend to rely, applies. A publicly traded partnership will, however, be treated as a partnership, and not as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes \u201cqualifying income\u201d within the meaning of the Code and it is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We refer to this exception as the \u201cQualifying Income Exception.\u201d\nQualifying income generally includes dividends, interest, capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stocks and securities and certain other forms of investment income. We believe that our return from investments will include interest, dividends, capital gains and other types of qualifying income, but no assurance can be given as to the types of income that will be earned in any given year.\nIf we fail to satisfy the Qualifying Income Exception, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on our income, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we would\nlikely be liable for state and local income and/or franchise taxes on our income. Finally, distributions of cash to shareholders would constitute qualified dividend income taxable to such shareholders to the extent of our earnings and profits and would not be deductible by us. Taxation of us as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flow and the after-tax returns for shareholders and thus could result in a substantial reduction in the value of our shares.\nShareholders that are not U.S. persons should also anticipate being required to file U.S. tax returns and may be required to pay U.S. tax solely on account of owning our shares.\nWe may be, or may become, engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes (directly or indirectly through pass-through subsidiaries), in which case some portion of our income would be treated as effectively connected income with respect to non-U.S. persons. Moreover, we may, in the future, sell interests in U.S. real holding property corporations (each a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d) and therefore be deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business at such time. If we were to realize gain from the sale or other disposition of a U.S. real property interest (including a USRPHC) or were otherwise engaged in a U.S. trade or business, non-U.S. persons holding our common shares generally would be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns and would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on their allocable share of the effectively connected income or gain at the regular U.S. federal income tax rates. Likewise, non-U.S. persons holding our preferred shares, by virtue of receiving guaranteed payments, may be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns and may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on their guaranteed payments, irrespective of our operations or investments. In both cases, non-U.S. persons that are corporations may also be subject to a branch profits tax on their allocable share of such income. Non-U.S. persons should anticipate being required to file U.S. tax returns and may be required to pay U.S. tax solely on account of owning our shares. Non-U.S. shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in our shares.\nNon-U.S. persons that hold (or are deemed to hold) more than 5% of any class of our shares (or held, or were deemed to hold, more than 5% of any class of our shares) may be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the disposition of some or all their shares.\nIf a non-U.S. person held more than 5% of any class of our shares at any time during the 5-year period preceding such non-U.S. person\u2019s disposition of such shares, and we were considered a USRPHC (determined as if we were a U.S. corporation) at any time during such 5-year period because of our current or previous ownership of U.S. real property interests above a certain threshold, such non-U.S. person may be subject to U.S. tax on such disposition of such shares (and may have a U.S. tax return filing obligation).\nTax-exempt shareholders may face certain adverse U.S. tax consequences from owning our shares.\nWe are not required to manage our operations in a manner that would minimize the likelihood of generating income that would constitute \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d (\u201cUBTI\u201d) to the extent allocated to a tax-exempt shareholder. Although we expect to invest through subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and such corporate investments would generally not result in an allocation of UBTI to a shareholder on account of the activities of those subsidiaries, we may not invest through corporate subsidiaries in all cases. Moreover, UBTI also includes income attributable to debt-financed property and we are not prohibited from incurring debt to finance our investments, including investments in subsidiaries. Furthermore, we are not prohibited from being (or causing a subsidiary to be) a guarantor of loans made to a subsidiary. If we (or certain of our subsidiaries) were treated as the borrower for U.S. tax purposes on account of those guarantees, some or all of our investments could be considered debt-financed property. In addition, the treatment of guaranteed payments for the use of capital to tax-exempt investors is not certain, and so distributions on our preferred shares may be treated as UBTI for federal income tax purposes, irrespective of our operations or the structure of our investments. The potential for income to be characterized as UBTI could make our shares an unsuitable investment for a tax-exempt entity. Tax-exempt shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in our shares.\nIf substantially all of the U.S. source rental income derived from aircraft or ships used to transport passengers or cargo in international traffic (\u201cU.S. source international transport rental income\u201d) of any of our non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries is attributable to activities of personnel based in the United States, such subsidiary could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at regular tax rates, rather than at a rate of 4% on gross income, which would adversely affect our business and result in decreased funds available for distribution to our shareholders.\nWe believe that the U.S. source international transport rental income of our non-U.S. subsidiaries generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, on a gross-income basis at a rate not in excess of 4%. If any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes did not comply with certain administrative guidelines of the IRS, such that 90% or more of such subsidiary\u2019s U.S. source international transport rental income were attributable to the activities of personnel based in the United States (in the case of bareboat leases) or from \u201cregularly scheduled transportation\u201d as defined in such administrative guidelines (in the case of time-charter leases), such subsidiary\u2019s U.S. source rental income would be treated as income effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States. In such case, such subsidiary\u2019s U.S. source international transport rental income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a maximum corporate tax rate, currently 21%. In addition, such subsidiary would be subject to the U.S. federal branch profits tax on its effectively connected earnings and profits at a rate of 30%. The imposition of such taxes could adversely affect our business and result in decreased funds available for distribution to our shareholders.\nThe ability of our corporate subsidiaries to utilize net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to offset their future taxable income may become limited.\nCertain of our corporate subsidiaries have significant NOLs, and any limitation on their use could materially affect our profitability. Such a limitation could occur if our corporate subsidiaries were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code. The rules for determining ownership changes are complex, and changes in the ownership of our shares could cause an ownership change in one or more of our corporate subsidiaries. Sales of our shares by our shareholders, as well as future issuances of our shares, could contribute to a potential ownership change in our corporate subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries may become subject to unanticipated tax liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSome of our subsidiaries are subject to income, withholding or other taxes in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions by reason of their jurisdiction of incorporation, activities and operations, where their assets are used or where the lessees of their assets (or others in possession of their assets) are located, and it is also possible that taxing authorities in any such jurisdictions could assert that our subsidiaries are subject to greater taxation than we currently anticipate. Further, the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) recently entered into force among the jurisdictions that ratified it. The implementation of BEPS prevention measures could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings by, for example, reducing the tax deductions or otherwise increasing the taxable income of our subsidiaries. In addition, a portion of certain of our non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries\u2019 income is treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and is accordingly subject to U.S. federal income tax. It is possible that the IRS could assert that a greater portion of any such non-U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 income is effectively connected income that should be subject to U.S. federal income tax, which could adversely affect our business and result in decreased funds available for distribution to our shareholders.\nOur structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure also is subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of our shareholders depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of our shareholders may also be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such action may affect our investments and commitments that were previously made, and could adversely affect the value of our shares or cause us to change the way we conduct our business.\nOur organizational documents and agreements permit the board of directors to modify our operating agreement from time to time, without the consent of shareholders, in order to address certain changes in Treasury regulations, legislation or interpretation. In some circumstances, such revisions could have a material adverse impact on some or all shareholders. Moreover, we will apply certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with applicable rules and to report income, gain, deduction, loss and credit to shareholders in a manner that reflects such shareholders\u2019 beneficial ownership of partnership items, taking into account variation in ownership interests during each taxable year because of trading activity. However, these assumptions and conventions may not be in compliance with all aspects of applicable tax requirements. It is possible that the IRS will assert successfully that the conventions and assumptions used by us do not satisfy the technical requirements of the Code and/or Treasury regulations and could require that items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, including interest deductions, be adjusted, reallocated, or disallowed, in a manner that adversely affects shareholders.\nWe could incur a significant tax liability if the IRS successfully asserts that the \u201canti-stapling\u201d rules apply to our investments in our non-U.S. and U.S. subsidiaries, which would adversely affect our business and result in decreased funds available for distribution to our shareholders.\nIf we were subject to the \u201canti-stapling\u201d rules of Section 269B of the Code, we would incur a significant tax liability as a result of owning more than 50% of the value of both U.S. and non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries, whose equity interests constitute \u201cstapled interests\u201d that may only be transferred together. If the \u201canti-stapling\u201d rules applied, our non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be treated as U.S. corporations, which would cause those entities to be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on their worldwide income. Because we intend to separately manage and operate our non-U.S. and U.S. corporate subsidiaries and structure their business activities in a manner that would allow us to dispose of such subsidiaries separately, we do not expect that the \u201canti-stapling\u201d rules will apply. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS would not successfully assert a contrary position, which would adversely affect our business and result in decreased funds available for distribution to our shareholders.\nBecause we cannot match transferors and transferees of our shares, we have therefore adopted certain income tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of applicable tax requirements. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our shares.\nBecause we cannot match transferors and transferees of our shares, we have adopted depreciation, amortization and other tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing Treasury regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our shareholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on the sale of our common shares and could have a negative impact on the value of our common shares or result in audits of and adjustments to our shareholders\u2019 tax returns.\nWe generally allocate items of income, gain, loss and deduction using a monthly or other convention, whereby any such items we recognize in a given month are allocated to our shareholders as of a specified date of such month. As a result, if a\nshareholder transfers its common shares, it might be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us after the date of the transfer. Similarly, if a shareholder acquires additional common shares, it might be allocated income, gain, loss, and deduction realized by us prior to its ownership of such common shares. Consequently, our shareholders may recognize income in excess of cash distributions received from us, and any income so included by a shareholder would increase the basis such shareholder has in its common shares and would offset any gain (or increase the amount of loss) realized by such shareholder on a subsequent disposition of its common shares.\nRules regarding U.S. federal income tax liability arising from IRS audits could adversely affect our shareholders.\nFor taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, we will be liable for U.S. federal income tax liability arising from an IRS audit, unless certain alternative methods are available and we elect to use them. It is possible that certain shareholders or we may be liable for taxes attributable to adjustments to our taxable income with respect to tax years that closed before such shareholders owned our shares. Accordingly, these rules may adversely affect certain shareholders in certain cases. The manner in which these rules apply is uncertain and in many respects depends on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department or the IRS. Investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential U.S. federal, state, foreign, local and any other tax considerations of the ownership and disposition of our shares.\nRisks Related to Our Shares\nThe market price and trading volume of our common and preferred shares may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders.\nThe market price of our common and preferred shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common and preferred shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common or preferred shares declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above your purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common and preferred shares may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our shares include:\n\u2022a shift in our investor base;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other comparable companies;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common shares;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022the operating and share price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022prevailing interest rates or rates of return being paid by other comparable companies and the market for securities similar to our preferred shares;\n\u2022additional issuances of preferred shares;\n\u2022whether we declare distributions on our preferred shares;\n\u2022overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022general economic conditions; and\n\u2022developments in the markets and market sectors in which we participate.\nStock markets in the United States have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, such as acts of terrorism, prolonged economic uncertainty, a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred shares.\nAn increase in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares.\nOne of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our shares is our distribution rate as a percentage of our share price relative to market interest rates. If the market price of our shares is based primarily on the earnings and return that we derive from our investments and income with respect to our investments and our related distributions to shareholders, and not from the market value of the investments themselves, then interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions will likely affect the market price of our shares. For instance, if market interest rates rise without an increase in our distribution rate, the market price of our shares could decrease, as potential investors may require a higher distribution yield on our shares or seek other securities paying higher distributions or interest. In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our outstanding and future (variable and fixed) rate debt, thereby adversely affecting cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay distributions.\nWe are required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls, and the outcome of that effort may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Because we are no longer an emerging growth company, we are subject to heightened disclosure obligations, which may impact our share price.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with Section 404 (\u201cSection 404\u201d) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires that we evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for that fiscal year. Section 404 also requires an independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, and report on, management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. Because we ceased to be an emerging growth company at the end of 2017, we were required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K starting with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and will be required to do so going forward. The outcome of our review and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. During the course of our review, we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity, and we may incur significant costs to remediate those deficiencies or otherwise improve our internal controls. As a public company, we are required to report control deficiencies that constitute a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d in our internal control over financial reporting. If we discover a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our share price could decline and our ability to raise capital could be impaired.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in FTAI may be diluted in the future because of equity awards granted and may be granted to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement and the Incentive Plan. Since 2015, we granted our Manager an option to acquire 3,903,010 common shares in connection with equity offerings. In the future, upon the successful completion of additional offerings of our common shares or other equity securities (including securities issued as consideration in an acquisition), we will grant to our Manager options to purchase common shares in an amount equal to 10% of the number of common shares being sold in such offerings (or if the issuance relates to equity securities other than our common shares, options to purchase a number of common shares equal to 10% of the gross capital raised in the equity issuance divided by the fair market value of a common share as of the date of the issuance), with an exercise price equal to the offering price per share paid by the public or other ultimate purchaser or attributed to such securities in connection with an acquisition (or the fair market value of a common share as of the date of the equity issuance if it relates to equity securities other than our common shares), and any such offering or the exercise of the option in connection with such offering would cause dilution.\nOur board of directors has adopted the Incentive Plan, which provides for the grant of equity-based awards, including restricted shares, stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, restricted share units, tandem awards and other equity-based and non-equity based awards, in each case to our Manager, to the directors, officers, employees, service providers, consultants and advisors of our Manager who perform services for us, and to our directors, officers, employees, service providers, consultants and advisors. We have initially reserved 30,000,000 common shares for issuance under the Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2021, rights relating to 3,737,742 of our common shares were outstanding under the Incentive Plan. In the future on the date of any equity issuance by us during the ten-year term of the Incentive Plan (including in respect of securities issued as consideration in an acquisition), the maximum number of shares available for issuance under the Plan will be increased to include an additional number of common shares equal to ten percent (10%) of either (i) the total number of common shares newly issued by us in such equity issuance or (ii) if such equity issuance relates to equity securities other than our common shares, a number of our common shares equal to 10% of (A) the gross capital raised in an equity issuance of equity securities other than common shares during the ten-year term of the Incentive Plan, divided by (B) the fair market value of a common share as of the date of such equity issuance.\nSales or issuances of our common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. The issuance of our common shares in connection with property, portfolio or business acquisitions or the exercise of outstanding options or otherwise could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares.\nThe incurrence or issuance of debt, which ranks senior to our common shares upon our liquidation, and future issuances of equity or equity-related securities, which would dilute the holdings of our existing common shareholders and may be senior to our common shares for the purposes of making distributions, periodically or upon liquidation, may negatively affect the market price of our common shares.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur or issue debt or issue equity or equity-related securities to finance our operations, acquisitions or investments. Upon our liquidation, lenders and holders of our debt and holders of our preferred shares (if any) would receive a distribution of our available assets before common shareholders. Any future incurrence or issuance of debt would increase our interest cost and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. We are not required to offer any additional equity securities to existing common shareholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, additional issuances of common shares, directly or through convertible or exchangeable securities (including limited partnership interests in our operating partnership), warrants or options, will dilute the holdings of our existing common shareholders and such issuances, or the perception of such issuances, may reduce the market price of our common shares. Any preferred shares issued by us would likely have a preference on distribution payments, periodically or upon liquidation, which could eliminate or otherwise limit our ability to make distributions to common shareholders. Because our decision to incur or issue debt or issue equity or equity-related securities in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts. Thus, common shareholders bear the risk that our future incurrence or issuance of debt or issuance of equity or equity-related securities will adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nOur determination of how much leverage to use to finance our acquisitions may adversely affect our return on our assets and may reduce funds available for distribution.\nWe utilize leverage to finance many of our asset acquisitions, which entitles certain lenders to cash flows prior to retaining a return on our assets. While our Manager targets using only what we believe to be reasonable leverage, our strategy does not limit the amount of leverage we may incur with respect to any specific asset. The return we are able to earn on our assets and funds available for distribution to our shareholders may be significantly reduced due to changes in market conditions, which may cause the cost of our financing to increase relative to the income that can be derived from our assets.\nWhile we currently intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders, we may change our dividend policy at any time.\nAlthough we currently intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to holders of our common shares, we may change our dividend policy at any time. Our net cash provided by operating activities has been less than the amount of distributions to our shareholders. The declaration and payment of dividends to holders of our common shares will be at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors, including actual results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, net cash provided by operating activities, restrictions imposed by applicable law, our taxable income, our operating expenses and other factors our board of directors deem relevant. Our long term goal is to maintain a payout ratio of between 50-60% of funds available for distribution, with remaining amounts used primarily to fund our future acquisitions and opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in amounts or on a basis consistent with prior distributions to our investors, if at all. Because we are a holding company and have no direct operations, we will only be able to pay dividends from our available cash on hand and any funds we receive from our subsidiaries and our ability to receive distributions from our subsidiaries may be limited by the financing agreements to which they are subject. In addition, pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner will be entitled to receive incentive allocations before any amounts are distributed by us based both on our consolidated net income and capital gains income in each fiscal quarter and for each fiscal year, respectively. Furthermore, the terms of our Series A preferred shares generally prevent us from declaring or paying dividends on or repurchasing our common shares or other junior capital unless all accrued distributions on such preferred shares have been paid in full.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our operating agreement and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nProvisions in our operating agreement may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our shareholders. For example, our operating agreement provides for a staggered board, requires advance notice for proposals by shareholders and nominations, places limitations on convening shareholder meetings, and authorizes the issuance of preferred shares that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt. In addition, certain provisions of Delaware law may delay or prevent a transaction that could cause a change in our control. The market price of our shares could be adversely affected to the extent that provisions of our operating agreement discourage potential takeover attempts that our shareholders may favor.\nThere are certain provisions in our operating agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors that differ from the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) in a manner that may be less protective of the interests of our shareholders.\nOur operating agreement provides that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law our directors or officers will not be liable to us. Under the DGCL, a director or officer would be liable to us for (i) breach of duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders, (ii) intentional misconduct or knowing violations of the law that are not done in good faith, (iii) improper redemption of shares or declaration of dividend, or (iv) a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. In addition, our operating agreement provides that we indemnify our directors and officers for acts or omissions to the fullest extent provided by law. Under the DGCL, a corporation can only indemnify directors and officers for acts or omissions if the director or officer acted in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation, and, in criminal action, if the officer or director had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Accordingly, our operating agreement may be less protective of the interests of our shareholders, when compared to the DGCL, insofar as it relates to the exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our common shares, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common shares are influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common units or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common share price may decline. If analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our common share price or trading volume to decline and our common shares to be less liquid.", "PERMNO": 15351, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "FTAI"}
