{"cik": "1059784", "company": "GENEREX BIOTECHNOLOGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-10-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that you should be aware of, some of which are described below. The risks, uncertainties and other factors described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nAny of the risks, uncertainties and other factors could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline substantially.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe will require additional financing to continue our operations after the current fiscal year and to carry out our strategic plans.\nThe July 31, 2018 cash position was not sufficient for 12 months\u2019 of operations. Note that anticipated revenues associated with the Veneto acquisition will dramatically alter the cash flow landscape. We do not, however, expect to generate significant cash flow from operations during that period and therefore expect to require additional funds after the end of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2019. In addition, we do not have sufficient funds to carry out our strategic development plans. Management is seeking various alternatives to ensure that we can meet our operating cash flow requirements and strategic development plans, through financing activities, such as private placement of our common stock, preferred stock offerings and offerings of debt and convertible debt instruments as well as through merger or acquisition opportunities. In addition, management is actively seeking strategic alternatives, including strategic investments and divestitures.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that we will obtain the required funding. Our inability to obtain required funding in the near future or our inability to obtain funding on favorable terms will have a material adverse effect on our operations and our strategic development plan for future growth. If we cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement our strategic development plan, our liquidity, financial condition and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a history of losses and will incur additional losses.\nWe are a development stage company with a limited history of operations, and do not expect sufficient revenues to support our operation in the immediately foreseeable future. We do not expect to receive significant revenues in Ecuador, Algeria and Lebanon where we have been approved for commercial sale in the next twelve months. While we have entered into a licensing and distribution agreement with a leading Indian-based pharmaceutical company and insulin distributor, we do not anticipate recognizing revenue from sales of Generex Oral-lyn\u2122 in India in 2017, as our partner has to receive approval from the Indian regulatory authority before the product can be offered for commercial sale in India.\nTo date, we have not been profitable and our accumulated net loss available to shareholders was $409,386,468 at July 31, 2018. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development, including clinical trials, and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. While we seek to attain profitability, we cannot be sure that we will ever achieve product and other revenue sufficient for us to attain this objective.\nWith the exception of Generex Oral-lyn\u2122, which has received regulatory approval in Ecuador, India (subject to regulatory approval of a 2012 in-country study), Lebanon and Algeria, the product candidates from Generex\u2019s historical business are in research or early stages of pre-clinical and clinical development. We will need to conduct substantial additional research, development and clinical trials. We will also need to receive necessary regulatory clearances both in the United States and foreign countries and obtain meaningful patent protection for and establish freedom to commercialize each of our product candidates. We must also complete further clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for Generex Oral-lyn\u2122 in countries outside of Ecuador, India, Lebanon and Algeria. We cannot be sure that we will obtain required regulatory approvals, or successfully research, develop, commercialize, manufacture and market any other product candidates. We expect that these activities, together with future general and administrative activities, will result in significant expenses for the foreseeable future.\nTo date, we have not been profitable and our accumulated net loss available to shareholders was $409,386,468 at July 31, 2018, and our consolidated balance sheet reflected a stockholders\u2019 deficiency of $43,584,668 at that date. We must secure financing to continue our operations.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective in future periods as a result of existing or newly identified material weaknesses in internal controls.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be adversely impacted, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and our business and stock price could be adversely affected.\nAt July 31, 2012, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and concluded that, subject to the inherent limitations identified in Item 9A of Part II of the Form 10-K filed on October 15, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting because of inadequate segregation of duties over authorization, review and recording of transactions, as well as the financial reporting of such transactions. Our independent auditors issued an adverse attestation report regarding the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting at July 31, 2012. We have not made a formal determination that our disclosure control and procedures are effective since that date.\nWe believe we have taken appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these deficiencies, however we cannot be certain that our remediation efforts will ensure that our management designs, implements and maintains adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that the changes made will be sufficient to address and eliminate the material weaknesses previously identified. Our inability to remedy any additional deficiencies or material weaknesses that may be identified in the future could, among other things, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as impair our ability to meet our quarterly, annual and other reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in a timely manner, and require us to incur additional costs or to divert management resources.\nOur research and development and commercialization efforts may depend on entering into agreements with corporate collaborators.\nBecause we have limited resources, we have sought to enter into collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical companies that will assist us in developing, testing, obtaining governmental approval for and commercializing products using our buccal delivery and immunomedicine technologies. We may be unable to achieve commercialization of any of our products until we obtain a large pharmaceutical partner to assist us in such commercialization efforts. To date, we have not entered into any such collaborative arrangements. Any collaborator with whom we may enter into such collaboration agreements may not support fully our research and commercial interests since our program may compete for time, attention and resources with such collaborator's internal programs. Therefore, these collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our program to move it forward effectively, or that the program will advance as rapidly as it might if we had retained complete control of all research, development, regulatory and commercialization decisions.\nRisks Related to Generex Technologies\nWith the exception of Generex Oral-lyn\u2122, our technologies and products are at an early stage of development and we cannot expect significant revenues in respect thereof in the foreseeable future.\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale at the present time with the exception of Generex Oral-lyn\u2122 in Ecuador, Lebanon, Algeria and India (subject to regulatory approval of a 2012 in-country study). To be profitable, we must not only successfully research, develop and obtain regulatory approval for our products under development, but also manufacture, introduce, market and distribute them once development is completed or find a partner that can perform these activities on our behalf. We have yet to manufacture, market and distribute these products on a large-scale commercial basis, and we do not expect to receive revenues from product sales in the next twelve months. We may not be successful in one or more of these stages of the development or commercialization of our products, and/or any of the products we develop may not be commercially viable. Until we can establish that they are commercially viable products, we will not receive significant revenues from ongoing operations.\nUntil we receive regulatory approval to sell our pharmaceutical products in additional countries, our ability to generate revenues from operations may be limited and those revenues may be insufficient to sustain operations. Many factors impact our ability to obtain approvals for commercially viable products.\nOur only pharmaceutical product that has been approved for commercial sale by drug regulatory authorities is our oral insulin spray formulation, and that approval was obtained in Ecuador, Lebanon, Algeria and India (subject to regulatory approval of a 2012 in-country study). We have initiated late stage clinical trials of Generex Oral-lyn\u2122 at clinical trial sites in North America and other countries according to the initial Phase III clinical plan. The final subjects completed the trial in August 2011. After appropriate validation, the data from approximately 450 patients was tabulated, reviewed and analyzed. Those results from the Phase III trial along with a comprehensive review and supplemental analyses of approximately 40 prior Oral-lyn clinical studies were compiled and submitted to the FDA in late December 2011 in a comprehensive package including a composite metanalysis of all safety data. We do not currently plan to expend significant resources on additional clinical trials of Oral-lyn\u2122 until after such time that we secure additional financing.\nOur immunomedicine products are in the pre-clinical stage of development, with the exception of a Phase II trial in human patients with stage II HER-2/neu positive breast cancer (U.S.), a Phase I trial in human patients with prostate cancer (Athens, Greece) completed in August 2009, a Phase I trial in human patients with breast or ovarian cancer (U.S.) and a Phase I trial in human volunteers of a peptide vaccine for use against the H5N1 avian influenza virus (Beirut, Lebanon). Preliminary results from the Phase II breast cancer trial suggest a 46% reduction in breast cancer recurrence in low HER2 expressing tumors, together with an excellent safety profile. While preliminary results are promising, they are not statistically significant and final results could deviate.\nPre-clinical and clinical trials of our products, and the manufacturing and marketing of our technologies, are subject to extensive, costly and rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, Canada and other countries. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities often takes many years, is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates. For these reasons, it is possible we will not receive regulatory approval for any prescription pharmaceutical product candidate in any countries other than Ecuador, Lebanon, Algeria and India.\nIn addition, we cannot be sure when or if we will be permitted by regulatory agencies to undertake additional clinical trials or to commence any particular phase of clinical trials. Because of this, statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our reports filed with the SEC regarding the expected timing of clinical trials cannot be regarded as actual predictions of when we will obtain regulatory approval for any \"phase\" of clinical trials.\nDelays in obtaining United States or other foreign approvals for our oral insulin product could result in substantial additional costs to us, and, therefore, could adversely affect our ability to continue operations. If regulatory approval is ultimately granted in any countries other than Ecuador, Lebanon, Algeria and India, the approval may place limitations on the intended use of the product we wish to commercialize, and may restrict the way in which we are permitted to market the product.\nDue to legal and factual uncertainties regarding the scope and protection afforded by patents and other proprietary rights, we may not have meaningful protection from competition.\nOur long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our patent rights and the patent rights of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. Because of this, our pending patent applications may not be granted. These uncertainties also mean that any patents that we own or will obtain in the future could be subject to challenge, and even if not challenged, may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition. Due to our financial uncertainties, we may not possess the financial resources necessary to enforce our patents. Patents already issued to us or our pending applications may become subject to dispute, and any dispute could be resolved against us.\nBecause a substantial number of patents have been issued in the field of alternative drug delivery and because patent positions can be highly uncertain and frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, the breadth of claims obtained in any application or the enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or, to the extent patents have been issued or will be issued, whether these patents will be subject to further proceedings limiting their scope, will provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage, or will be circumvented or invalidated. Several of our currently issued patents have expired or will expire in the next twelve months.\nAlso because of these legal and factual uncertainties, and because pending patent applications are held in secrecy for varying periods in the United States and other countries, even after reasonable investigation we may not know with certainty whether any products that we (or a licensee) may develop will infringe upon any patent or other intellectual property right of a third party. For example, we are aware of certain patents owned by third parties that such parties could attempt to use in the future in efforts to affect our freedom to practice some of the patents that we own or have applied for. Based upon the science and scope of these third-party patents, we believe that the patents that we own or have applied for do not infringe any such third-party patents; however, we cannot know for certain whether we could successfully defend our position, if challenged. We may incur substantial costs if we are required to defend our intellectual property in patent suits brought by third parties. These legal actions could seek damages and seek to enjoin testing, manufacturing and marketing of the accused product or process. In addition to potential liability for significant damages, we could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the accused product or process.\nRisks Related to Marketing of Generex\u2019s Potential Products\nWe may not become, or stay, profitable even if our pharmaceutical products are approved for sale.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval to market our oral insulin product outside of Ecuador, India, Lebanon and Algeria or to market any other prescription pharmaceutical product candidate, many factors may prevent the product from ever being sold in commercial quantities. Some of these factors are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022 acceptance of the formulation or treatment by health care professionals and diabetic patients;\n\u2022 the availability, effectiveness and relative cost of alternative diabetes or immunomedicine treatments that may be developed by competitors; and\n\u2022 the availability of third-party (i.e. insurer and governmental agency) reimbursements.\nWe will not receive significant revenues from Generex Oral-lyn\u2122 or any of our other pharmaceuticals products that may receive regulatory approval until we can successfully manufacture, market and distribute them in the relevant markets.\nWe have to depend upon others for marketing and distribution of our products, and we may be forced to enter into contracts limiting the benefits we may receive and the control we have over our products. We intend to rely on collaborative arrangements with one or more other companies that possess strong marketing and distribution resources to perform these functions for us. We may not be able to enter into beneficial contracts, and we may be forced to enter into contracts for the marketing and distribution of our products that substantially limit the potential benefits to us from commercializing these products. In addition, we will not have the same control over marketing and distribution that we would have if we conducted these functions ourselves.\nWe may not be able to compete with treatments now being marketed and developed, or which may be developed and marketed in the future by other companies.\nOur products will compete with existing and new therapies and treatments. We are aware of a number of companies currently seeking to develop alternative means of delivering insulin, as well as new drugs intended to replace insulin therapy at least in part. We are also aware of a number of companies currently seeking to develop alternative means of enhancing and suppressing peptides. In the longer term, we also face competition from companies that seek to develop cures for diabetes and other malignant, infectious, autoimmune and allergic diseases through techniques for correcting the genetic deficiencies that underlie some of these diseases.\nNumerous pharmaceutical, biotechnology and drug delivery companies, hospitals, research organizations, individual scientists and nonprofit organizations are engaged in the development of alternatives to our technologies. Some of these companies have greater research and development capabilities, experience, manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we do. Collaborations or mergers between large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with competing drug delivery technologies could enhance our competitors\u2019 financial, marketing and other resources. Developments by other drug delivery companies could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining FDA approval for products or gaining market acceptance more rapidly than we can.\nSome of our most significant competitors, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and Novo Nordisk, have discontinued development and/or sale of their inhalable forms of insulin. Unlike inhaled insulin formulations, Generex Oral-lyn\u2122 is a buccally absorbed formulation with no residual pulmonary deposition.\nIf government programs and insurance companies do not agree to pay for or reimburse patients for our pharmaceutical products, our success will be impacted.\nSales of our oral insulin formulation in Ecuador, Lebanon, Algeria and India and our other potential pharmaceutical products in other markets will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement by third-party payers such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers often challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Governmental approval of health care products does not guarantee that these third-party payers will pay for the products. Even if third-party payers do accept our product, the amounts they pay may not be adequate to enable us to realize a profit. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our products are approved for marketing and any such changes could further limit reimbursement.\nRisks Related to Potential Liabilities\nWe face significant product liability risks, which may have a negative effect on our financial condition.\nThe administration of drugs or treatments to humans, whether in clinical trials or commercially, can result in product liability claims whether or not the drugs or treatments are actually at fault for causing an injury. Furthermore, our pharmaceutical products may cause, or may appear to have caused, serious adverse side effects (including death) or potentially dangerous drug interactions that we may not learn about or understand fully until the drug or treatment has been administered to patients for some time. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us, which could have a severe negative effect on our financial condition. We previously maintained product liability insurance in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable for our levels of activity and exposure. We no longer carry this insurance due to lack of activities and funds.\nRisks Related to the Market for Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is below $5.00 per share and is treated as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which places restrictions on broker-dealers recommending the stock for purchase.\nOur common stock is defined as \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder. The SEC has adopted regulations that define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to include common stock that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules include the following requirements:\n\u2022 broker-dealers must deliver, prior to the transaction a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market;\n\u2022 broker-dealers must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer and its registered representative;\n\u2022 broker-dealers must disclose current quotations for the securities;\n\u2022 if a broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealers presumed control over the market; and\n\u2022 a broker-dealer must furnish its customers with monthly statements disclosing recent price information for all penny stocks held in the customer\u2019s account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nAdditional sales practice requirements are imposed on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. If our common stock remains subject to these penny stock rules these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our stock, which could affect a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell their shares.\nThe price of our common stock may be affected by a limited trading volume, may fluctuate significantly and may not reflect the actual value of our business.\nThere may be a limited public market for our common stock on the OTCQB market, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will continue. An absence of an active trading market could adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell our common stock in short time periods, or at all. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors, such as our sale of securities in connection with capital raising activities, could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. Thus, the price at which shares of our common stock may trade from time to time may not reflect the actual value of our business or the actual value of our common stock.\nFrom time to time, we may hire companies to assist us in pursuing investor relations strategies to generate increased volumes of investment in our common stock. Such activities may result, among other things, in causing the price of our common stock to increase on a short-term basis.\nFurthermore, the stock market generally and the market for stocks of companies with lower market capitalizations and small biopharmaceutical companies, like us, have from time to time experienced, and likely will again experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf an exemption under state securities laws is not available for resales of shares of common stock, state securities regulators have the authority to seek rescission of such resales and, in some instances, may seek restitution or disgorgement of amounts received on such resales.\nBecause the shares of common stock registered under our S-1 registration statements have not been registered or qualified for resale under the securities laws of any state, an exemption from registration or qualification under state law is necessary for compliance with state securities laws. Generex has taken no steps to register or qualify, nor seek an exemption for, the resale of the shares of common stock under the securities laws of any state. The availability of exemptions will depend on the laws of the particular state in which a holder of the shares resides and the circumstances under which such holder seeks to sell the shares. If an exemption is not available but a resale of the shares is affected, state securities laws give state securities regulators authority to seek rescission (or cancellation) of transactions involving sales of securities that are not registered, qualified or exempted and, in some instances, authority to require restitution or disgorgement of profits from the sales of such securities and to impose statutory interest or penalties on disgorged amounts. While we are not aware of any state securities regulator taking action with respect to the resales of shares of our common stock, we cannot provide any assurance that regulators will refrain from taking such action in the future.\nProvisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation could delay or prevent the acquisition or sale of our business.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits our Board of Directors to designate new series of preferred stock and issue those shares without any vote or action by our stockholders. Such newly authorized and issued shares of preferred stock could contain terms that grant special voting rights to the holders of such shares that make it more difficult to obtain stockholder approval for an acquisition of our business or increase the cost of any such acquisition.\nOur prior and future equity financing may dilute current stockholders and could prevent the acquisition or sale of our business.\nOn February 9, 2017, we entered into a Right to Shares Agreement with the holder of our Series G Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to which that holder agreed convert 100% of those preferred shares into an aggregate of 33,939 shares of Generex common stock. The conversion was at effective price of $10.31 per share. The Company initially delivered 1,000 shares (on a post reverse split basis) pursuant to The Right to Shares Agreement. At the same time, the holder exercised Warrants through cashless exercise for an aggregate of 103,809 shares of Generex common stock. Pursuant to a Right to Shares Agreement, the remaining 33,939 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock issued upon conversion of the preferred stock, together with the 103,809 Warrant shares issuable to that holder, will be delivered to that holder from time to time based on draw down notices submitted to the Company by that holder.\nUnder the Right to Shares Agreement, the holder may not request issuance of shares, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise, the holder (together with the holder\u2019s Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder\u2019s Affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation is initially 4.99%. From and after sixty-one (61) days after the date of the Right to Shares Agreement, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be increased from 4.99% to 9.99%.\nThe delivery of the shares of common stock described above could have an anti-takeover effect because such issuance will make it more difficult for, or discourage an attempt by, a party to obtain control of Generex by tender offer or other means. The delivery of those shares will increase the number of shares entitled to vote, increase the number of votes required to approve a change of control of the company, and dilute the interest of a party attempting to obtain control of the company.\nIf we raise funds through one or more additional equity financings in the future, it will have a further dilutive effect on existing holders of our shares by reducing their percentage ownership. The shares may be sold at a time when the market price is low because we are in need of the funds. This will dilute existing holders more than if our stock price was higher. In addition, equity financings normally involve shares sold at a discount to the current market price. Most of our outstanding warrants have price protection provisions, which decrease the exercise price of the warrant and increase the number of shares which may be purchased upon exercise of the warrants, if we sell additional equity at an effective price per common share less than the current exercise price of the warrant. Therefore, equity financings at a low price per share will result in even more dilution to existing shareholders.\nRisks Related to HDS\u2019 Business\nRisks related to our industry, business and strategy\nBecause we may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of our products, we may not generate revenues in the amounts we expect, or in the amounts necessary to continue our business. Our existing products as well as our manufacturing facility must meet quality standards and are subject to inspection by a number of domestic regulatory and other governmental and non-governmental agencies.\nAll of HDS\u2019 proposed and existing products are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and/or other domestic and international governmental, public health agencies, regulatory bodies or non-governmental organizations. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacturing, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products. The process of obtaining required approvals or clearances varies according to the nature of, and uses for, a specific product. These processes can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human or animal clinical trials, sampling activities, and other costly, time-consuming procedures. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that the authority will grant an approval or clearance for that product. Each authority may impose its own requirements and can delay or refuse to grant approval or clearance, even though a product has been approved in another country.\nThe time taken to obtain approval or clearance varies depending on the nature of the application and may result in the passage of a significant period of time from the date of submission of the application. Delays in the approval or clearance processes increase the risk that we will not succeed in introducing or selling the subject products, and we may determine to devote our resources to different products.\nChanges in government regulations could increase our costs and could require us to undergo additional trials or procedures, or could make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all.\nChanges in government regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations because we may have to incur additional expenses if we are required to change or implement new testing, manufacturing and control procedures. If we are required to devote resources to develop such new procedures, we may not have sufficient resources to devote to research and development, marketing, or other activities that are critical to our business.\nWe can manufacture and sell our products only if we comply with regulations and quality standards established by government agencies such as the FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) as well as by non-governmental organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (\u201cISO\u201d) and WHO. We have implemented a quality control system that is intended to comply with applicable regulations. Although FDA approval is not required for the export of our products, there are export regulations promulgated by the FDA that specifically relate to the export of our products that require compliance with FDA quality system regulation and that also require meeting certain documentary requirements regarding the approval of the product in export markets. Although we believe that we meet the regulatory standards required for the export of our products, these regulations could change in a manner that could adversely impact our ability to export our products.\nOur products may not be able to compete with new diagnostic products or existing products developed by well-established competitors, which would negatively affect our business.\nThe diagnostic industry is focused on the testing of biological specimens in a laboratory or at the point-of-care and is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Some of our principal competitors may have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Several companies produce diagnostic tests that compete directly with our testing product line, including but not limited to, Chembio Diagnostics and Abbot Laboratories. Furthermore, these and/or other companies have or may have products incorporating molecular and/or other advanced technologies that over time could directly compete with our testing product line. As new products incorporating new technologies enter the market, our products may become obsolete or a competitor's products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold.\nThere are competing products that could significantly reduce our U.S. sales of rapid HIV tests.\nIn 2006 Alere, Inc. acquired a division from Abbott Diagnostic located in Japan that manufactured and marketed a rapid HIV test product line called Determine\u00ae. The Determine\u00ae format was developed for the developing world and remote settings and, central to the needs of that market. The format is essentially a test strip that is integrated into a thin foil wrapper. When opened, the underside of the wrapper serves as the test surface for applying the blood sample and performing the test. This design reduces costs and shipping weights and volumes and provides an advantage for the developing world markets it serves. Some of the disadvantages of the platform are the amount of blood sample that is needed (50 microliters versus 2.5, 5 and 10 for our lateral flow barrel, lateral flow cassette, and DPP\u00ae products respectively), the open nature of the test surface, and the absence of a true control that differentiates biological from other kinds of samples.\nThe so-called \"3rd generation\" version of this product has been marketed for many years and is the leading rapid HIV test that is used in a large majority of the national algorithms of countries funded by PEPFAR and the Global Fund, as well as many other countries in the world. That product is not FDA-approved though it is CE marked. The newest Determine\u00ae HIV version, which was developed and manufactured by Alere's subsidiary in Israel, Orgenics, is the so-called \"4th Generation\" version Determine\u00ae test. According to its claims, this product detects HIV antibodies and P24 HIV antigens. Because the P24 antigen is known to occur in HIV-positive individuals' blood samples before antibodies do, the 4th generation Determine\u00ae test is designed to detect HIV infection earlier than tests that solely rely on antibody detection. HDS\u2019 tests, as well as all of the other currently FDA-approved rapid HIV tests, only detect antibodies.\nThe initial \"4th generation\" Alere Determine\u00ae rapid test product that was also CE marked and that Alere launched internationally some years ago has not been successfully commercialized to the best of our knowledge and at least certain published studies were not favorable for this product. However, the 4th generation product that is now FDA-approved was apparently modified as compared to the initial international version, and it may perform more satisfactorily. Alere received FDA approval of this modified product in August 2013 and CLIA waiver for it in December 2014. Alere is also aggressively pursuing development of the market for this product. Moreover, there is support by a number of key opinion leaders for the public health value of such 4th generation tests, and this product represents a significant competitive threat to Chembio as well as to each of the other rapid HIV test manufacturers (OraSure and Trinity primarily).\nAlere has subsequently been acquired by Abbott Laboratories, a major diagnostic company, which gives them additional market and sales capabilities internationally.\nDuring 2011, Biolytical, Inc. of Vancouver, Canada received FDA approval and in 2012 received CLIA waiver of a flow-through rapid HIV test called \"INSTI\". The flow-through technology used in the INSTI test is older than lateral flow, and requires handling of multiple components (3 vials of solution) to perform the test in multiple steps. However, these steps can be accomplished in less than ten minutes, and the actual test results occur in only one minute after those steps are completed. Therefore sample-to-result time is shorter than any of the competitive products. The product also has good performance claims. There are settings where that reduced total test time, despite the multiple steps required, may be a distinct advantage, and we believe Biolytical has made some progress in penetrating certain public health markets.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties concerning current and anticipated developments in this market. Although we have no specific knowledge of any other new product that is a significant competitive threat to our products, or that will render our products obsolete, if we fail to maintain and enhance our competitive position or fail to introduce new products and product features, our customers may decide to use products developed by our competitors, which could result in a loss of revenues and cash flow.\nMore generally, the point-of-care diagnostics industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. As new technologies become introduced into the point-of-care diagnostic testing market, we may be required to commit considerable additional efforts, time and resources to enhance our current product portfolio or develop new products. We may not have the available time and resources to accomplish this, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which would materially harm our operating results.\nOur use of third-party suppliers, some of which may constitute our sole supply source, for certain important product components presents a risk that could have negative consequences for other business.\nA number of our components and critical raw materials are provided by third-party suppliers, some of which may be sole-source suppliers, which impacts our ability to manufacture or sell product if our suppliers cannot or will not deliver those materials in a timely fashion, or at all, due to an interruption in their supply, quality or technical issues, or any other reason. If this occurs, we could incur substantial expense and time to be able to reestablish the appropriate quality, cost, regulatory and market-acceptance circumstances needed for commercial success. Even with the needed expense and time, we may not be able to reestablish any or all of these factors. The absence of any one or more of these factors could prevent us from being able to commercially produce and market the affected product or products.\nNew developments in health treatments or new non-diagnostic products may reduce or eliminate the demand for our products.\nThe development and commercialization of products outside of the diagnostics industry could adversely affect sales of our products. For example, the development of a safe and effective vaccine to HIV or treatments for other diseases or conditions that our products are designed to detect, could reduce or eventually eliminate the demand for our HIV or other diagnostic products and result in a loss of revenues.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to effectively introduce and market our products, which could materially harm our operating results.\nIntroducing and achieving market acceptance for our products will require substantial marketing efforts and will require us and/or our contract partners, sales agents, and/or distributors to make significant expenditures of time and money. In some instances, we will be significantly or totally reliant on the marketing efforts and expenditures of our contract partners, sales agents, and/or distributors. If they do not have or commit the expertise and resources to effectively market the products that we manufacture, our operating results will be materially harmed.\nThe success of our business depends on, in addition to the market success of our products, our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity or through borrowing, and we may not be able to raise capital or borrow funds on attractive terms and/or in amounts necessary to continue our business, or at all.\nOur liquidity and cash requirements will depend on several factors. These factors include, among others, (1) the level of revenues; (2) the extent to which, if any, that revenue level improves operating cash flows; (3) our investments in research and development, facilities, marketing, regulatory approvals, and other investments we may determine to make; and (4) our investment in capital equipment and the extent to which it improves cash flow through operating efficiencies. We do not expect to generate positive cash flow in next twelve months, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital to fund our needs. If we are not able to raise additional capital from another source, we will be required to substantially reduce our operating costs, including the possibilities of suspending our unfunded research and development activities, and quickly curtailing any cash flow negative product initiatives.\nOur near term sales are difficult to predict in the uncertain status of pending orders and certain regulatory approvals, and the uncertain time until we have approval to sell in the US. We believe that underlying demand for HIV rapid testing in the United States remains strong, and that the restoration of some of the funding cutbacks from sequestration and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and of the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations will have a positive impact on the development of the market.\nHowever, development of new customers with this product is costly and time-consuming.\nCurrently, we are dependent on international sales of our products, since we have no products approved by the FDA for US sales. The nature of international business is such that it can be volatile from period to period, depending on ordering patterns of donor-funded programs.\nA number of factors can slow or prevent international sales increases or cause sales decreases, or substantially increase the cost of achieving sales assuming they are achieved. These factors include:\n\u2022 economic conditions and the absence of or reduction in available funding sources;\n\u2022 regulatory requirements and customs regulations;\n\u2022 cultural and political differences;\n\u2022 foreign exchange rates, currency fluctuations and tariffs;\n\u2022 dependence on and difficulties in managing international distributors or representatives;\n\u2022 the creditworthiness of foreign entities;\n\u2022 difficulties in foreign accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022 competition;\n\u2022 pricing; and\n\u2022 any inability we may have in maintaining or increasing revenues.\nIf we are unable to increase our revenues from domestic and/or international customers, our operating results will be materially harmed.\nAlthough we have an ethics and anti-corruption policy in place, and have no knowledge or reason to know of any practices by our employees, agents or distributors that could be construed as in violation of such policies, our business includes sales of products to countries where there is or may be widespread corruption.\nHDS has a policy in place prohibiting its employees, distributors and agents from engaging in corrupt business practices, including activities prohibited by the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). Nevertheless, because we work through independent sales agents and distributors outside the United States, we do not have control over the day-to-day activities of such independent agents and distributors. In addition, in the donor-funded markets in Africa where we may sell our products, there is significant oversight from PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and advisory committees comprised of technical experts concerning the development and establishment of national testing protocols. This is a process that includes an overall assessment of a product which includes extensive product performance evaluations including five active collaborations and manufacturer\u2019s quality systems, as well as price and delivery.\nTo the extent that we are unable to collect our outstanding accounts receivable, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nThere may be circumstances and timing that require us to accept payment terms, including delayed payment terms, from distributors or customers, which, if not satisfied, could cause financial losses. We generally accept payment terms which require us to ship product before the contract price has been paid fully, and there also are circumstances pursuant to which we may accept further delayed payment terms pursuant to which we may continue to deliver product. To the extent that these circumstances result in significant accounts receivables and those accounts receivables are not paid on a timely basis, or are not paid at all, especially if concentrated in one or two customers, we could suffer financial losses.", "PERMNO": 88250, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GNBT"}
