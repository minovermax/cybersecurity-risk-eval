RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that affect our business and results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of some of the important factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Some of the following risks relate principally to the industry in which we operate and to our business. Other risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nVolatility of oil and gas prices significantly affects our results and profitability.\nPrices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. We cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices with any certainty. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Factors that can cause price fluctuations include the level of global demand for petroleum products; foreign supply and pricing of oil and gas; the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain oil price and production controls; nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation, including environmental regulations; level of domestic and international exploration, drilling and production activity; the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts; availability, proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; weather conditions; the price and availability of alternative fuels; technological advances affecting energy consumption; and, overall political and economic conditions in oil producing countries.\nIncreases and decreases in prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The amount we can borrow from banks may be subject to redetermination based on changes in prices. In addition, we may have ceiling test writedowns when prices decline. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that can be produced economically. Thus, we may experience material increases or decreases in reserve quantities solely as a result of price changes and not as a result of drilling or well performance.\nChanges in oil and gas prices impact both estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved reserves. Any reduction in reserves, including reductions due to price fluctuations, can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and adversely affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to obtain additional capital for our exploration and development activities.\nOil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. Our financial results are more sensitive to movements in natural gas prices than oil prices because most of our production is natural gas. Lower prices or lack of storage may have an adverse affect on our financial condition due to reduction of our revenues, operating income and cash flows; curtailment or shut-in of our production due to lack of transportation or storage capacity; cause certain properties in our portfolio to become economically unviable; and, limit our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations.\nLower oil and gas prices and other factors may cause us to record ceiling test writedowns.\nLower oil and gas prices increase the risk of ceiling limitation write-downs. We use the full cost method to account for oil and gas operations. Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties may not exceed a \u201cceiling limit\u201d which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at 10% plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling limit, we must charge the amount of the excess against earnings. This is called a \u201cceiling test writedown.\u201d Under the accounting rules, we are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. A ceiling test writedown does not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce stockholders\u2019 equity and earnings. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low. We incurred impairment charges during fiscal 2016 and may incur additional impairment charges in the future, particularly if commodity prices remain at their currently low levels or decline further, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken. There were no ceiling test impairments on our oil and gas properties during fiscal 2015 and 2014.\nIn the past we have entered into price swap derivatives and may in the future enter into additional price swap derivatives for a portion of our production, which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil.\nWe have used price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales. Under these swap contracts, we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on NYMEX WTI pricing. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment are offset, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. Such contracts and any future swap arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase. In addition, these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil.\nWe must replace reserves we produce.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional, economically recoverable oil and gas reserves. Our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we can find, develop or acquire replacement reserves. One offset to the obvious benefits afforded by higher product prices especially for small to mid-cap companies in this industry, is that quality domestic oil and gas reserves are hard to find.\nApproximately 47% and 39% of our total estimated net proved reserves at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were undeveloped, and those reserves may not ultimately be developed.\nRecovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling. Our reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions, however, may not prove correct. If we or the outside operators of our properties choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to write-off these reserves. Any such write-offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our common stock.\nInformation concerning our reserves and future net revenues estimates is inherently uncertain.\nEstimates of oil and gas reserves, by necessity, are projections based on engineering data, and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as future production, oil and gas prices, operating costs, development costs and remedial costs, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. As a result, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas and of future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially. As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on a twelve month un-weighted first-day-of-the-month average oil and gas prices for the twelve months prior to the date of the report. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower.\nAn increase in the differential between NYMEX and the reference or regional index price used to price our oil and gas would reduce our cash flow from operations.\nOur oil and gas is priced in the local markets where it is produced based on local or regional supply and demand factors. The prices we receive for our oil and gas are typically lower than the relevant benchmark prices, such as The New York Mercantile Exchange (\u201cNYMEX\u201d). The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential. Numerous factors may influence local pricing, such as refinery capacity, pipeline capacity and specifications, upsets in the midstream or downstream sectors of the industry, trade restrictions and governmental regulations. Additionally, insufficient pipeline capacity, lack of demand in any given operating area or other factors may cause the differential to increase in a particular area compared with other producing areas. During fiscal 2016, differentials averaged $1.01 per Bbl of oil and $0.39 per Mcf of gas. Increases in the differential between the benchmark prices for oil and gas and the wellhead price we receive could significantly reduce our revenues and our cash flow from operations.\nOur exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.\nNew wells that we drill may not be productive, or we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. Drilling for crude oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry holes but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project.\nDrilling and operating activities are high risk activities that subject us to a variety of factors that we cannot control.\nThese factors include availability of workover and drilling rigs, well blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, pollution, releases of toxic gases and other environmental hazards and risks. Any of these operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us. In addition, we incur the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered, and there is no assurance that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in wells drilled or re-entered.\nAcquisitions are subject to the risks and uncertainties of evaluating reserves and potential liabilities and may be disruptive and difficult to integrate into our business.\nWe plan to continue growing our reserves through acquisitions. Acquired properties can be subject to significant unknown liabilities. Prior to completing an acquisition, it is generally not feasible to conduct a detailed review of each individual property to be acquired in an acquisition. Even a detailed review or inspection of each property may not reveal all existing or potential liabilities associated with owning or operating the property. Moreover, some potential liabilities, such as environmental liabilities related to groundwater contamination, may not be discovered even when a review or inspection is performed. Our initial reserve estimates for acquired properties may be inaccurate. Downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, including reserves added through acquisitions, could require us to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which would reduce our earnings and our stockholders\u2019 equity. In addition, we may have to assume cleanup or reclamation obligations or other unanticipated liabilities in connection with these acquisitions. The scope and cost of these obligations may ultimately be materially greater than estimated at the time of the acquisition.\nWe may not be able to fund the capital expenditures that will be required for us to increase reserves and production.\nWe must make capital expenditures to develop our existing reserves and to discover new reserves. Historically, we have used our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund our capital expenditures, however, lower oil and gas prices may prevent these options. Volatility in oil and gas prices, the timing of our drilling programs and drilling results will affect our cash flow from operations. Lower prices and/or lower production will also decrease revenues and cash flow, thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements, including reducing the amount available to pursue our drilling opportunities. If our cash flow from operations does not increase as a result of planned capital expenditures, a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations will be required for debt service and operating expenses and our planned capital expenditures would, by necessity, be decreased.\nThe borrowing base under our credit facility will be determined from time to time by the lender. Reductions in estimates of oil and gas reserves could result in a reduction in the borrowing base, which would reduce the amount of financial resources available under the credit facility to meet our capital requirements. Such a reduction could be the result of lower commodity prices and/or production, inability to drill or unfavorable drilling results, changes in oil and gas reserve engineering, the lenders\u2019 inability to agree to an adequate borrowing base or adverse changes in the lenders\u2019 practices regarding estimation of reserves.\nIf cash flow from operations or our borrowing base decrease for any reason, our ability to undertake exploration and development activities could be adversely affected. As a result, our ability to replace production may be limited. In addition, if the borrowing base under the credit facility is reduced, we would be required to reduce our borrowings under the credit facility so that such borrowings do not exceed the borrowing base. This could further reduce the cash available to us for capital spending and, if we did not have sufficient capital to reduce our borrowing level, we may be in default under the credit facility.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including crude oil and natural gas prices, the availability of capital, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals and other factors. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling in these projects. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations.\nFailure to comply with covenants under our debt agreement could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revolving credit facility agreement requires us to comply with certain customary covenants including limitations on change of control, disposition of assets, mergers and reorganizations. We are also obligated to meet certain financial covenants. For example, our revolving credit facility requires, among other things, minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) of $100,000 for the two fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2016, $300,000 for the three fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2016, $500,000 for the four fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2017 and $650,000 for each trailing fiscal quarter period thereafter and minimum interest coverage ratios (EBITDA/Interest Expense) of 1.25 to 1 for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2016 and 2 to 1 for each quarter thereafter. If we fail to meet any of these loan covenants, the lender under the revolving credit facility could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets.\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive.\nCompetition for oil and gas reserve acquisitions is significant. We may compete with major oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators, some of which have financial and personnel resources substantially in excess of those available to us. As a result, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Our ability to acquire and develop additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties and prospects for future development activities. In addition, the oil and gas industry as a whole also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The price and availability of alternative energy sources could adversely affect our revenue. The market for our oil, gas and natural gas liquids production depends on factors beyond our control, including domestic and foreign political conditions, the overall level of supply of and demand for oil, gas and natural gas liquids, the price of imports of oil and gas, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and overall economic conditions.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenues.\nA substantial amount of our business activities are conducted through joint operating or other agreements under which we own working and royalty interests in natural gas and oil properties in which we do not operate. As a result, we have a limited ability to exercise influence over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of underlying properties and their associated costs. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations could reduce our revenues and production.\nOur business depends on oil and natural gas transportation facilities which are owned by others.\nThe marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Federal and state regulation of oil and gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions could all affect our ability to produce and market our oil and gas.\nWe may not be insured against all of the operating hazards to which our business is exposed.\nOur operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the exploration for, and development and production of oil and gas including blowouts, fires and other casualties. We maintain insurance coverage customary for operations of a similar nature, but losses could arise from uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.\nIncreases in taxes on energy sources may adversely affect the company\u2019s operations.\nFederal, state and local governments which have jurisdiction in areas where the company operates impose taxes on the oil and natural gas products sold. Historically, there has been an on-going consideration by federal, state and local officials concerning a variety of energy tax proposals. Such matters are beyond our ability to accurately predict or control.\nProposed changes to U.S. tax laws, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe U.S. President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Proposal includes provisions that would, if enacted, make significant changes to U. S. federal income tax laws including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Other changes include, but are not limited to: (1) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (2) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (3) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (4) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in the U. S. federal income tax laws could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of our chief executive officer or other key personnel could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, upon the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer, Nicholas C. Taylor, our President and Chief Financial Officer, Tamala L. McComic, and other key personnel, who have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and gas properties and developing and executing acquisitions and financing. We do not have key-man insurance on the lives of Mr. Taylor and Ms. McComic. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could, therefore, significantly and adversely affect our operations. Competition for qualified individuals is intense and we may be unable to find or attract qualified replacements for our officers and key employees on acceptable terms.\nWe may be affected by one substantial shareholder.\nNicholas C. Taylor beneficially owns approximately 45% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Taylor is also our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, Mr. Taylor has significant influence in matters voted on by our shareholders, including the election of our Board members. Mr. Taylor participates in all facets of our business and has a significant impact on both our business strategy and daily operations. The retirement, incapacity or death of Mr. Taylor, or any change in the power to vote shares beneficially owned by Mr. Taylor, could result in negative market or industry perception and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock in the future, which could cause dilution to all shareholders.\nWe may seek to raise additional equity capital in the future. Any issuance of additional shares of our common stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of all shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock.\nWe have not and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on our common stock to date and it is not anticipated that any will be paid to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The terms of our existing credit facility restricts the payment of dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.\nControl by our executive officers and directors may limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval and could discourage our potential acquisition by third parties.\nAs of March 31, 2016, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 48% of our common stock. These stockholders, if acting together, would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially.\nMexco common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT. The market price of our common stock has and could continue to experience volatility due to reasons unrelated to our operating performance. These reasons include: supply and demand for natural gas and oil; political conditions in natural gas and oil producing regions; demand for our common stock and limited trading volume; investor perception of our industry; fluctuations in commodity prices; variations in our results of operations; legislative or regulatory changes; general trends in the oil and natural gas industry; market conditions and analysts\u2019 estimates; and, other events in the oil and gas industry.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.\nFailure of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results.\nThe management of Mexco is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect Mexco\u2019s transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.", "PERMNO": 89857, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "MXC"}
