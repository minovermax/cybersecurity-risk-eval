Set forth below are the most important risks that we face. In evaluating our business and your investment in us, you should also consider the other information presented in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWeather conditions could affect certain of the Company's markets such as agriculture and construction.\nThe Company's Applied Technology Division is largely dependent on the ability of farmers and agricultural subcontractors known as custom operators to purchase agricultural equipment that includes its products. If such farmers experience adverse weather conditions resulting in poor growing conditions, or experience unfavorable crop prices or expenses, potential buyers may be less likely to purchase agricultural equipment. Accordingly, weather conditions may adversely affect sales in the Applied Technology Division.\nWeather conditions can also adversely affect sales in the Company's Engineered Films Division. To the extent weather conditions curtail construction or agricultural activity, sales of the segment's plastic sheeting will likely decrease.\nPrice fluctuations in and shortages of raw materials could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to sustain and grow earnings.\nThe Company's Engineered Films Division consumes significant amounts of plastic resin, the costs of which reflect market prices for natural gas and oil and other market forces. These prices are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the control of the Company. Although the Engineered Films Division is sometimes able to pass such price increases to its customers, significant variations in the cost of plastic resins can affect the Company's operating results from period to period. Unusual supply disruptions, such as caused by a natural disaster, could cause suppliers to invoke \u201cforce majeure\u201d clauses in their supply agreements, causing shortages of material. Success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. If the Company is not able to fully offset the effects of material availability and costs, financial results could be adversely affected.\nElectronic components, used by both the Applied Technology Division and Aerostar Division, are sometimes in short supply, impacting our ability to meet customer demand.\nIf a supplier of raw materials or components were unable to deliver due to shortage or financial difficulty, any of the Company's segments could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in commodity prices can increase our costs and decrease our sales.\nAgricultural income levels are affected by agricultural commodity prices and input costs. As a result, changes in commodity prices that reduce agricultural income levels could have a negative effect on the ability of growers and their contractors to purchase the Company's precision agriculture products manufactured by its Applied Technology Division.\nExploration for oil and natural gas fluctuates with their price. Plastic sheeting manufactured and sold by our Engineered Films Division is sold as pit and pond liners to contain water used in the drilling process. Lower prices for oil and natural gas could reduce exploration activities and demand for our products. Plastic sheeting manufacturing uses plastic resins, which can be subject to changes in price as the cost of natural gas or oil changes. Accordingly, volatility in oil and natural gas prices may negatively affect our cost of goods sold or cause us to change prices, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nFailure to develop and market new technologies and products could impact the Company's competitive position and have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company's operating results in Applied Technology, Engineered Films, and Aerostar depend upon the ability to renew the pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability could be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development, obtain relevant regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products and services. Because of the lengthy development process, technological challenges and intense competition, there can be no assurance that any of the products the Company is currently developing, or could begin to develop in the future, will achieve substantial commercial success. Technical advancements in products may also increase the risk of product failure, increasing product returns or warranty claims and settlements. In addition, sales of the Company's new products could replace sales of some of its current products, offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction.\nThe Company's sales of proprietary products are subject to uncertainties, start-up costs and inefficiencies and both competitive and compliance risks.\nThe Company's sales of proprietary products, which are specialized and highly technical in nature, are subject to uncertainties, start-up costs and inefficiencies as well as market, competitive, and compliance risks.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy emphasizes the design and manufacture of proprietary products while transitioning its contract manufacturing services capabilities principally to support proprietary market opportunities. For Aerostar in particular, this transition from contract manufacturing services could take too long or be unsuccessful. Further, highly technical, specialized product inventories may be more susceptible to fluctuations in market demand. If demand is unexpectedly low, write-downs or impairments of such inventory may become necessary. Either of these outcomes could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company's contract electronic manufacturing services business and sewing businesses in the Aerostar Division have been dependent on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of a small group of customers. Aerostar is moving to transform itself into a proprietary manufacturer and service provider. To compete effectively, Aerostar must continue to provide technologically advanced products and services, maintain strict quality standards, respond flexibly and rapidly to customer needs and deliver products globally on a reliable basis at competitive prices. Start-up costs and inefficiencies can adversely affect operating results and such costs may not be recoverable in a proprietary product environment, because the Company may not\nreceive reimbursement from its customers for such costs. Reductions in the Company's existing contract revenues, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, will adversely affect its ability to sustain and grow its future sales and earnings.\nFuture sales will be dependent on the success of Aerostar's growth drivers, including advanced radar systems, high-altitude balloons, and aerostats to international markets. Sales of certain of these products into international markets increase the compliance risk associated with regulations such as The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), as well as others, exposing the Company to fines and its employees to fines, imprisonment or civil penalties. Potential consequences of a material violation of such regulations include damage to our reputation, litigation, and increased costs. These consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company's Aerostar segment depends on the U.S. government for a significant portion of its sales, creating uncertainty in the timing of and funding for projected contracts.\nA significant portion of Aerostar's sales are to the U.S. government or U.S. government agencies as a prime or sub-contractor. Government spending has historically been cyclical. A decrease in U.S. government defense or near-space research spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of the Company's programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. Reductions in the Company's existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could adversely affect its ability to sustain and grow its future sales and earnings. The Company's U.S. government sales are funded by the federal budget, which operates on an October-to-September fiscal year. Changes in congressional schedules, negotiations for program funding levels, reduced program funding due to U.S government debt limitations, automatic budget cuts (\"sequestration\") or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract. Funds for multi-year contracts can be changed in subsequent years in the appropriations process.\nIn addition, the U.S. government has increasingly relied on indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and other procurement vehicles that are subject to a competitive bidding and funding process even after the award of the basic contract, adding an additional element of uncertainty to future funding levels. Delays in the funding process or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or can lead to changes in program content or termination at the government's convenience. The loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on the Company's future sales and earnings.\nThe Company derives a portion of its revenues from foreign markets, which subjects the Company to business risks, including risk of changes in government policies and laws or worldwide economic conditions.\nThe Company's sales outside the U.S. were $36.8 million in fiscal 2015, representing 10% of consolidated net sales. The Company's financial results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of U.S. and non-U.S. governments, agencies and similar organizations, along with changes in worldwide economic conditions. These conditions include, but are not limited to, changes in a country's or region's economic or political condition; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; local labor conditions and regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions on currency exchange activities; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability of our products in U.S. dollars in foreign markets where payments are made in the local currency; burdensome taxes and tariffs; and other trade barriers. International risks and uncertainties also include changing social and economic conditions, terrorism, political hostilities and war, difficulty in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables, and increased transportation or other shipping costs. Any of these such risks could lead to reduced sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales.\nAdverse economic conditions in the major industries the Company serves may materially affect segment performance and consolidated results of operations.\nThe Company's results of operations are impacted by the market fundamentals of the primary industries served. Significant declines of economic activity in the agricultural, oil and gas exploration, construction, industrial, aerospace/aviation, communication, defense and other major markets served may adversely affect segment performance and consolidated results of operations.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the benefits of its restructuring efforts.\nSupplementing the actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, on March 10, 2015 we announced an additional plan to restructure our business to lower the cost structure of each of our business segments to address current end-market weakness. There is no guarantee that these restructuring efforts will increase our operating margins or profitability and these efforts could cause unforeseen complexities and additional cash outflows.\nThe Company may pursue or complete acquisitions which represent additional risk and could impact future financial results.\nThe Company's business strategy includes the potential for future acquisitions. Acquisitions involve a number of risks including integration of the acquired company with the Company's operations and unanticipated liabilities or contingencies related to the acquired company. Further, business strategies supported by the acquisition may be in perceived, or actual, opposition to strategies\nof certain of our customers and our business could be materially adversely affected if those relationships are terminated and the expected strategic benefits are delayed or are not achieved. The Company cannot ensure that the expected benefits of any acquisition will be realized. Costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that have not yet or may not close which could significantly impact the operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, after the acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Other acquisition risks include delays in realizing benefits from the acquired companies or products; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new product or geographic markets we enter; unforeseen adjustments, charges or write-offs; unforeseen losses of customers of, or suppliers to, acquired businesses; difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses; or challenges arising from increased geographic diversity and complexity of our operations and our information technology systems.\nTotal goodwill and intangible assets account for approximately $70.6 million, or 19%, of the Company's total assets as of January 31, 2015. The Company evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or intangible assets. Our expected future cash flows could be adversely impacted if our anticipated sales growth is not realized. An impairment would adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may fail to continue to attract, develop and retain key management and other key employees, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees, including experienced and skilled technical personnel. The loss of certain members of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, could negatively impact our operating results and ability to execute our business strategy. Our future success will also depend in part upon our ability to attract, train, motivate, and retain qualified personnel.\nThe Company may fail to protect its intellectual property effectively, or may infringe upon the intellectual property of others.\nThe Company has developed significant proprietary technology and other rights that are used in its businesses. The Company relies on trade secret, copyright, trademark, and patent laws and contractual provisions to protect the Company's intellectual property. While the Company takes enforcement of these rights seriously, other companies such as competitors, or analogous persons in markets the Company does not participate, may attempt to copy or use the Company's intellectual property for their own benefit.\nIn addition, intellectual property of others also has an impact on the Company's ability to offer some of its products and services for specific uses or at competitive prices. Competitors' patents or other intellectual property may limit the Company's ability to offer products and services to its customers. Any infringement or claimed infringement of the intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect the Company's ability to continue to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, products and services.\nIntellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of the Company's resources, both of which could adversely affect its businesses and financial condition and results. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of the Company's intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.\nTechnology failures or cyber-attacks on the Company's systems could disrupt the Company's operations or the functionality of its products and negatively impact the Company's business.\nThe Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In addition, a significant portion of internal communications, as well as communication with customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Further, the products in our Applied Technology segment depend upon GPS and other systems through which our products interact with government computer systems and other centralized information sources. We are exposed to the risk of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. Cyber incidents may be deliberate attacks for the theft of intellectual property or other sensitive information or may be the result of unintentional events. Like most companies, the Company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company's control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. Further, attacks on centralized information sources could affect the operation of our products or cause them to malfunction. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Company's risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company's operations are not disrupted. Potential consequences of a material cyber incident include damage to our reputation, litigation, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs. Such consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 62033, "SIC": 3080, "TIC": "RAVN"}
