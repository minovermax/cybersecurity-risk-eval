The following list, which contains certain risks that may be unique to the Corporation and to the banking industry, is neither all-inclusive nor are the factors in any particular order.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe Corporation\u2019s performance and financial condition may be adversely affected by regional economic conditions and real estate values.\nThe Bank\u2019s loan and deposit activities are largely based in eastern Pennsylvania. As a result, the Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial performance depends largely upon economic conditions in this eastern Pennsylvania region. This region experienced deteriorating local economic conditions during 2008 through 2011, and a resumption of this deterioration in the regional real estate market could harm our financial condition and results of operations because of the geographic concentration of loans within this regional area and because a large percentage of our loans are secured by real property. If there is further decline in real estate values, the collateral for the Corporation\u2019s loans will provide less security. As a result, the Corporation\u2019s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, and the Bank will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nAdditionally, a significant portion of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio is invested in commercial real estate loans. Often in a commercial real estate transaction, repayment of the loan is dependent on rental income. Economic conditions may affect the tenant\u2019s ability to make rental payments on a timely basis, or may cause some tenants not to renew their leases, each of which may impact the debtor\u2019s ability to make loan payments. Further, if expenses associated with commercial properties increase dramatically, the tenant\u2019s ability to repay, and therefore the debtor\u2019s ability to make timely loan payments, could be adversely affected.\nAll of these factors could increase the amount of the Corporation\u2019s non-performing loans, increase its provision for credit losses and reduce the Corporation\u2019s net income.\nClimate change, severe weather, natural disasters, global health risks or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nNatural disasters, including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change, global health risks or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us or our customers. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in lost revenue, or cause us to incur additional expenses.\nRapidly changing interest rate environment could reduce the Corporation\u2019s net interest margin, net interest income, fee income and net income.\nInterest and fees on loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, are a significant part of the Corporation\u2019s net income. Interest rates are key drivers of the Corporation\u2019s net interest margin and subject to many factors beyond the control of the Corporation. As interest rates change, net interest income is affected. Rapidly increasing interest rates in the future could result in interest expenses increasing faster than interest income because of divergence in financial instrument maturities and/or competitive pressures. Further, substantially higher interest rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth. Decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore decrease net interest income. Changes in interest rates might also impact the values of equity and debt securities under management and administration by the Wealth Management Division which may have a negative impact on fee income. See the section captioned \u201cNet Interest Income\u201d in the MD&A section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding interest rate risk.\nEconomic troubles may negatively affect our leasing business.\nThe Corporation\u2019s leasing business, which began operations in September 2006, consists of the nationwide leasing of various types of equipment to small- and medium-sized businesses. Economic sluggishness may result in higher credit losses than we would experience in our traditional lending business, as well as potential increases in state regulatory burdens such as state income taxes, personal property taxes and sales and use taxes.\nA general economic slowdown could impact Wealth Management Division revenues.\nA general economic slowdown may cause current clients to seek alternative investment opportunities with other providers, which would decrease the value of Wealth Management Division's assets under management and administration resulting in lower fee income to the Corporation.\nRevenues from our capital markets business line may be adversely affected by adverse market or economic conditions.\nUnfavorable financial or economic conditions have the ability to reduce the number and size of transactions in which we provide capital markets advisory and other advisory services. Specifically, a number of our clients engaging in capital markets and strategic and other types of transactions often rely on access to the equity and credit markets to finance their transactions. A lack of available equity investments or credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of these transactions by our clients. Because the revenues of our capital markets business are in the form of financial advisory other fees and are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate, a decrease in the number and size of transactions would adversely affect our capital markets business.\nOur ability to attract and maintain customer and investor relationships depends largely on our reputation.\nDamage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential customers and investors in our ability to provide high-quality financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and vendors and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our service-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described in this report, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, customer personal information and privacy issues, customer and other third-party fraud, record-keeping, technology-related issues including but not limited to cyber fraud, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Maintaining our reputation also depends on our ability to successfully prevent third parties from infringing on our brands and associated trademarks and our other\nintellectual property. Defense of our reputation, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through litigation, could result in costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with legal standards, we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients, which could negatively affect our earnings.\nManaging or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important to client satisfaction, which in turn is important to the earnings and growth of our investment businesses. Failure to comply with these standards, adequately manage these risks or manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities could also result in liability.\nProvision for loan and lease losses and level of non-performing loans may need to be modified in connection with internal or external changes.\nAll borrowers carry the potential to default and our remedies to recover may not fully satisfy money previously loaned. We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents the Corporation\u2019s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of the Corporation, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance for loan losses reflects the Corporation\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic conditions; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of the Corporation. An increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income, and possibly risk-based capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe design of the allowance for loan loss methodology is a dynamic process that must be responsive to changes in environmental factors. Accordingly, at times the allowance methodology may be modified in order to incorporate changes in various factors including, but not limited to, levels and trends of delinquencies and charge-offs, trends in volume and types of loans, national and economic trends and industry conditions.\nIncreased regulatory oversight, uncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Efforts in the United States to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes in other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans, and to a lesser extent securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings, including the rates we pay on our subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, any successor or replacement interest rates may perform differently and we may incur significant costs to transition both our borrowing arrangements and the loan agreements with our customers from LIBOR, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Management\u2019s transition plan includes a number of key work streams, including developing an inventory of financial instruments and contracts impacted by LIBOR; identifying and evaluating the scope of existing financial instruments and contracts that may be affected by the transition, and the extent to which such financial instruments and contracts already contain appropriate fallback language or would require amendment; conducting appropriate outreach to clients, as needed; and, risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt the Corporation\u2019s business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to advance our strategic objectives by opening new branches or offices or acquiring and investing in banks and in other complementary businesses, such as wealth advisory or insurance agencies. As a result, we may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity. Our acquisition activities could be material to us. For example, we could issue additional shares of common stock in a purchase transaction, which could dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interest. These activities could require us to use a substantial amount of cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with our prior or potential future acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized. Any potential charges for impairment related to goodwill would not directly impact cash flow or tangible capital.\nOur acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in the Corporation\u2019s attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nexperiencing higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations;\n\u2022\ncreating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nlosing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received;\n\u2022\nrisk of significant problems relating to the conversion of the financial and customer data of the entity being acquired into the Corporation\u2019s financial and customer product systems; and,\n\u2022\npotential impairment of intangible assets created in business acquisitions.\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with pending or potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets, and our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value.\nDecreased residential mortgage origination, volume and pricing decisions of competitors could affect our net income.\nThe Corporation originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates and pricing decisions by our loan competitors affect demand for the Corporation\u2019s residential mortgage loan products, the revenue realized on the sale of loans and revenues received from servicing such loans for others, ultimately reducing the Corporation\u2019s net income. New regulations, increased regulatory reviews, and/or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which the Corporation utilizes to sell mortgage loans may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business.\nOur mortgage servicing rights could become impaired, which may require us to take non-cash charges.\nBecause we retain the servicing rights on many loans we sell in the secondary market, we are required to record a mortgage servicing right asset, which we test quarterly for impairment. The value of mortgage servicing rights is heavily dependent on market interest rates and tends to increase with rising interest rates and decrease with falling interest rates. If we are required to record an impairment charge, it would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting standards periodically change and the application of our accounting policies and methods may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nThe regulatory bodies that establish accounting standards, including, among others, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC, periodically revise or issue new financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of\nour consolidated financial statements. The effect of such revised or new standards on our financial statements can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, management must exercise judgment in appropriately applying many of our accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles. In some cases, management may have to select a particular accounting policy or method from two or more alternatives. In some cases, the accounting policy or method chosen might be reasonable under the circumstances and yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported if we had selected a different policy or method. Accounting policies are critical to fairly presenting our financial condition and results of operations and may require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain.\nFASB ASU 2016-13 will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIssued in June 2016, ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326 - Credit Losses), commonly referenced as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d), eliminates the Provision for Loan and Lease Losses (the \u201cProvision\u201d) and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (the \u201cAllowance\u201d) line items and establishes the Provision for Credit Losses (\"PCL\") and Allowance for Credit Losses (\"ACL\") line items.\nUnder the legacy \u201cIncurred Loss\u201d notion, management presents an Allowance intended to represent \u201cprobable and estimable\u201d incurred but not yet realized credit losses on assets in scope. When management deems collection of contractual cashflows for an instrument unlikely, a specific reserve is calculated under ASC 310-10. Management further calculates a general reserve for performing assets under ASC 450-20, using historical loss experience and adjustments for several qualitative factors, including current economic conditions. The \u201cIncurred Loss\u201d standard does not allow for projections beyond the likely \u2018emergence period\u2019 of losses, or for forward-looking economic conditions; for example, loss contingencies in 2022 are not currently presented, nor is the presentation adjusted for the likelihood of future economic condition change.\nIn contrast, the future accounting standard requires projection of credit loss over the contract lifetime of the asset, adjusted for prepayment tendencies. Further, management\u2019s specific expectations for the future economic environment must be incorporated in the projection, with loss expectations to revert to the long-run historical mean after such time as management can make or obtain a reasonable and supportable forecast. This valuation reserve will be established in the ACL and maintained through expense (provision) in the PCL. In the event that additional allocation is required to fund the ACL at adoption, investors will see a cumulative-effect (one-time) adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption of the new standard.\nThe new CECL standard became effective for the Corporation beginning January 1, 2020. Management is validating the Corporation's CECL model and methodologies, however we expect an initial increase to the ACL, including reserves for unfunded commitments, not to exceed 130% of the December 31, 2019 Allowance, or an incremental increase to the December 31, 2019 Allowance of approximately $6.8 million. When finalized, this one-time increase as a result of the adoption of CECL will be recorded, net of tax, as an adjustment to retained earnings effective January 1, 2020. This estimate is subject to change based on continuing refinement and validation of the model and methodologies. For more information regarding the CECL standard, see Note 2, \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDeclines in asset values may result in impairment charges and may adversely affect the value of the Corporation\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA majority of the Corporation\u2019s investment portfolio is comprised of securities which are collateralized by residential mortgages. These residential mortgage-backed securities include securities of U.S. government agencies, U.S. government-sponsored entities, and private-label collateralized mortgage obligations. The Corporation\u2019s securities portfolio also includes obligations of U.S. government-sponsored entities, obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof, and equity securities. The fair value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the issuer or composition of the obligations themselves, such as rating downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of liquidity for resale of certain investment securities. Quarterly, the Corporation evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Given the significant judgments involved, if we are incorrect in our impairment assessment, this error could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows. If the Corporation incurs impairment charges that result in its falling below the \u201cwell capitalized\u201d regulatory requirement, it may need to raise additional capital. Further, a decline in the fair value of the securities in our investment portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows.\nLegal proceedings to which we are subject or may become subject may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nLike many banks and other financial services organizations in our industry, we are from time to time involved in various legal proceedings and subject to claims and other legal actions related to our business activities brought by customers, employees and others. All such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and resources, and distracting to management. If resolved against us, such legal proceedings could result in excessive verdicts and judgments, injunctive relief, equitable relief, and other adverse consequences that may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business. Similarly, if we settle such legal proceedings, it may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business. Future court decisions, alternative dispute resolution awards, matters arising due to business expansion, or legislative activity may increase our exposure to litigation and regulatory investigations. In some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage; there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover any particular verdict, judgment, or settlement that may be entered against us, that such coverage will prove to be adequate, or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. Legal proceedings to which we are subject or may become subject may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nA return to recessionary conditions or a large and unexpected rise in interest rates could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which would lead to lower revenue, higher loan losses and lower earnings.\nFalling home prices and sharply reduced sales volumes, along with the collapse of the United States\u2019 subprime mortgage industry in 2008 that followed a national home price peak in mid-2006, significantly contributed to a recession that officially lasted until June 2009, although the effects continued thereafter. Dramatic declines in real estate values and high levels of foreclosures resulted in significant asset write-downs by financial institutions, which caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with other institutions and, in some cases, to fail. A return of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and a return to higher unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. A large or unexpected rise in interest rates could materially impact consumer and business ability to repay, thus increasing our level of nonperforming loans and reducing demand for loans. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s earnings.\nIn February 2011, as required under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC issued a ruling that changed the assessment base against which FDIC assessments for deposit insurance are made. Instead of FDIC insurance assessments being based upon an insured bank\u2019s deposits, FDIC insurance assessments are generally based on an insured bank\u2019s total average assets minus average tangible equity. A change in the risk categories applicable to BMBC\u2019s bank subsidiaries, further adjustments to base assessment rates, and any special assessments could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation.\nIn addition, should bank failures begin to increase in number or the FDIC insurance fund become depleted in others ways, FDIC premiums could increase or additional special assessments could be imposed. These increased premiums would have an adverse effect on our net income and results of operations.\nThe stability of other financial institutions could have detrimental effects on our routine funding transactions.\nRoutine funding transactions may be adversely affected by the actions and soundness of other financial institutions. Financial service institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, borrowing or other relationships. Transactions are executed on a daily basis with different industries and counterparties, and routinely executed with counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result, a rumor, default or failures within the financial services industry could lead to market-wide liquidity problems which in turn could materially impact the financial condition of the Corporation.\nThe Corporation may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations and may need to raise additional capital in the future, whether in the form of debt or equity, to provide us with\nsufficient capital resources to meet our regulatory and business needs. We cannot assure you that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at the time, which are outside of our control, and our financial condition. If the Corporation is unable to generate sufficient additional capital though its earnings, or other sources, including sales of assets, it would be necessary to slow earning asset growth and or pass up possible acquisition opportunities, which may result in a reduction of future net income growth. Further, an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf sufficient wholesale funding to support earning-asset growth is unavailable, the Corporation\u2019s net income may decrease.\nManagement recognizes the need to grow both non-wholesale and wholesale funding sources to support earning asset growth and to provide appropriate liquidity. The Corporation\u2019s asset growth over the past few years has been supplemented by various forms of wholesale funding which is defined as wholesale deposits (primarily wholesale certificates of deposit) and borrowed funds (Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (\u201cFHLB\u201d), Federal advances and Federal fund line borrowings). Wholesale funding at December 31, 2019 represented approximately 18.0% of total funding compared to 17.1% at December 31, 2018 and 15.9% at December 31, 2017. Wholesale funding is subject to certain practical limits such as the FHLB\u2019s Maximum Borrowing Capacity and the Corporation\u2019s liquidity targets. Additionally, regulators might consider wholesale funding beyond certain points to be imprudent and might suggest that future asset growth be reduced or halted.\nIn the absence of wholesale funding sources, the Corporation may need to reduce earning asset growth through the reduction of current production, sale of assets, and/or the participating out of future and current loans or leases. This in turn might reduce future net income of the Corporation.\nThe amount loaned to us is generally dependent on the value of the collateral pledged and the Corporation\u2019s financial condition. These lenders could reduce the percentages loaned against various collateral categories, eliminate certain types of collateral and otherwise modify or even terminate their loan programs, particularly to the extent they are required to do so because of capital adequacy or other balance sheet concerns, or if disruptions in the capital markets occur. Any change or termination of our borrowings from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve or correspondent banks may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and profitability.\nThe capital and credit markets are volatile and could cause the price of our stock to fluctuate.\nThe capital and credit markets periodically experience volatility. In some cases, the markets may produce downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers seemingly without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. Market volatility may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and/or our ability to access capital. Several factors could cause the market price for our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future, including without limitation:\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments related to our business, any of our competitors or the financial services industry in general;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of our securities into the marketplace;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in our markets or the worldwide economy;\n\u2022\na shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections;\n\u2022\nour announcement of new acquisitions or other projects; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory changes.\nAny failure of BMBC, the Bank or their subsidiaries to comply with federal and state regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business.\nBMBC and the Bank are supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the State of Delaware. Accordingly, BMBC, the Bank and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state legislation, regulation and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on almost all aspects of our\nbusiness operations and which are primarily designed to protect consumers, depositors and the government's deposit insurance funds, and is not designed to protect shareholders. These include, but are not limited to, the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations, the USA PATRIOT Act, the GLB Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, regulations and sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, real estate-secured consumer lending regulations (such as Truth-in-Lending), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act regulations, trust laws and regulations, and licensing and registration requirements for mortgage originators and insurance brokers. Federal and state banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties.\nBecause our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, are continuously reviewed and change frequently. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act has changed the bank regulatory framework, created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and established more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies. The ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. While the Corporation has policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the applicable laws, rule and regulations, there is risk that BMBC and the Bank may be determined not to have complied with applicable requirements, and any failure, even if such failure was unintentional or inadvertent, could result in adverse action to be taken by regulators, including through formal or informal supervisory enforcement actions, and could result in the assessment of fines and penalties. In some circumstances, additional negative consequences also may result from regulatory action, including restrictions on the Corporation\u2019s business activities, acquisitions and other growth initiatives. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nThere is also no assurance that laws, rules and regulations will not be proposed or adopted in the future, which could (i) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (ii) restrict our ability to originate, modify, broker or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (iii) restrict our ability to foreclose on property securing loans, (iv) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or (v) otherwise materially and adversely affect our business or prospects for business. These risks could affect our deposit funding and the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which could negatively affect our financial performance and financial condition.\nPreviously enacted and potential future legislation, including legislation to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system, could adversely affect our business.\nThe change in President and political party controlling the Executive Branch of the Federal Government resulting from the 2016 U.S. presidential election has brought changes to laws and regulations of the U.S. financial services industry, including the 2018 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d), and may continue to bring changes that we cannot now predict. The EGRRCPA, which amended the Dodd-Frank Act, directed certain federal banking regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, to take action to reduce the regulatory burden on certain banks and financial institutions. Federal banking regulatory agencies are currently working on taking the actions congressionally mandated by the EGRRCPA; however, uncertainty about the timing and scope of any such changes as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime, may negatively impact our business, at least in the short-term, even if the long-term impact of any such changes are positive for our business.\nMarket conditions have resulted in the creation of various programs by the United States Congress, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC that were designed to enhance market liquidity and bank capital. As these programs expire, are withdrawn or reduced, the impact on the financial markets, banks in general and their customers is unknown. This could have the effect of, among other things, reducing liquidity, raising interest rates, reducing fee revenue, limiting the ability to raise capital, all of which could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the Bank and BMBC.\nAdditionally, the federal government has passed a variety of other reforms related to banking and the financial industry including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed significant regulatory and compliance changes. Effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business include:\n\u2022\nchanges to regulatory capital requirements;\n\u2022\nexclusion of hybrid securities, including trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010 from Tier I capital;\n\u2022\ncreation of new government regulatory agencies (such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which will oversee systemic risk, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will develop and enforce rules for bank and non-bank providers of consumer financial products);\n\u2022\npotential limitations on federal preemption;\n\u2022\nchanges to deposit insurance assessments;\n\u2022\nregulation of debit interchange fees we earn;\n\u2022\nchanges in retail banking regulations, including potential limitations on certain fees we may charge; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and risk retention.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the ability of banks to engage in certain proprietary trading or to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds, commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The EGRRCPA provided an exemption from the Volcker Rule\u2019s restrictions for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions designed to limit the ability of insured depository institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates to conduct certain swaps and derivatives activities and to take certain principal positions in financial instruments.\nSome provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately upon its enactment. Many provisions, however, require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies in order to be implemented, some of which have been proposed by the applicable federal agencies. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may have unintended effects, which will not be clear until implementation. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act could limit our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise materially and adversely affect us. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements could also materially and adversely affect us.\nThe CFPB may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, which may directly impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the \u201cFederal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof,\u201d with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\u201d in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service (\u201cUDAAP authority\u201d). The potential reach of the CFPB\u2019s broad rulemaking powers and UDAAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Bank, is currently unknown.\nGovernmental discretionary policies may impact the operations and earnings of the Corporation.\nThe operations of the Corporation are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve Board regulates monetary policy and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of all financial institutions in the past and may continue to do so in the future.\nPotential losses incurred in connection with possible repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market may require us to increase our financial statement reserves in the future.\nWe engage in the origination and sale of residential mortgages into the secondary market. In connection with such sales, we make certain representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require us to repurchase such loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. These representations and warranties vary based on the nature of the transaction and the purchaser\u2019s or insurer\u2019s requirements, but generally pertain to the ownership of the mortgage loan, the real property securing the loan and compliance with applicable laws and applicable lender and government-sponsored entity underwriting guidelines in connection with the origination of the loan. While we believe our mortgage lending practices and standards to be adequate, we have settled a small number of claims we consider to be immaterial; we may receive requests in the future, however, which could be material in volume. If that were to happen, we\ncould incur losses in connection with loan repurchases and indemnification claims, and any such losses might exceed our financial statement reserves, requiring us to increase such reserves. In that event, any losses we might have to recognize and any increases we might have to make to our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur ability to realize our deferred tax asset may be reduced as a result of the tax reform legislation enacted in late 2017, which could adversely impact results of operation and negatively affect our financial condition.\nRealization of a deferred tax asset requires us to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences. The deferred tax asset may be reduced in the future if estimates of future income or our tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset. If it is determined that a valuation allowance of its deferred tax asset is necessary, the Corporation may incur a charge to earnings. The value of our deferred tax asset is directly related to the income tax rates in effect at the time of use. In late 2017, the U.S. Congress passed significant legislation reforming the Internal Revenue Code known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\" or the \u201cTax Act\u201d). On December 22, 2017, legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform\u201d), was signed into law. The Tax Act, among other changes, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the Tax Act, the Corporation recorded a $15.2 million one-time income tax charge related to the re-measurement of the Corporation\u2019s net deferred tax asset, triggered by the Tax Act, during the year ended December 31, 2017, and a $2.6 million tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 for certain discrete items included on our 2017 tax return that was filed during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nEnvironmental risk associated with our lending activities could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we perform limited environmental due diligence in conjunction with originating loans secured by properties, we believe have environmental risk, we could be subject to environmental liabilities on real estate properties we foreclose upon and take title to in the normal course of our business. In connection with environmental contamination, we may be held liable to governmental entities or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties, or we may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances at a property. The investigation or remediation costs associated with such activities could be substantial. Furthermore, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination even if we were the former owner of a contaminated site. The incurrence of a significant environmental liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are present even though we perform environmental due diligence on our collateral properties. Such diligence may not reflect all current risks or threats, and unforeseen or unpredictable future events may cause a change in the environmental risk profile of a property after a loan has been made.\nTechnological systems failures, interruptions and security breaches could negatively impact our operations and reputation.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger, our deposits, and our loans. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions, and security breaches, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, any compromise of our security systems could deter customers from using our web site and our online banking service, which involve the transmission of confidential information. Although we rely on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource certain of our data processing to third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any systems failure, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our customers and other institutions, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products, and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.\nWe, our customers, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, and other information of ours, our employees, our customers, or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 network access or business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nCybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Additionally, the existence of cyber attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyber attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or other consequences in the future. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority.\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including financial counterparties; financial intermediaries such as clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses; vendors; regulators; and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber attack or other information or security breach, termination or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses.\nCyber attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our\nconfidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to meet customer expectations for technology-driven products and services could reduce demand for bank and wealth services.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so on our part could significantly reduce the number of new wealth and bank customers resulting in a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation is subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Management diligently reviews and updates its internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future which could limit the growth of our business.\nWe may not be able to sustain a positive rate of growth or expand our business. We expect that other banking and financial service companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than us, will compete with us in acquiring other financial institutions if we pursue such acquisitions. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. Also, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals for a transaction, we will not be able to consummate such transaction which we believe to be in our best interests. Among other things, our regulators consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Other factors, such as economic conditions and legislative considerations, may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence. If we are not able to successfully grow our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry is very competitive, especially in the Corporation\u2019s market area, and such competition could affect our operating results.\nThe Corporation faces competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services such as trust and investment management services throughout the Corporation\u2019s market area. The Corporation\u2019s competitors include other community banks, larger banking institutions, trust companies and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, registered investment advisors, financial planning firms, leasing companies, government-sponsored enterprises, on-line banking enterprises, mutual fund companies, insurance companies and other non-bank businesses. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than the Corporation. This is especially evident in regard to advertising and public relations spending. For a more complete discussion of our competitive environment, see \u201cDescription of Business and Competition\u201d in Item 1 above. If the Corporation is unable to compete effectively, the Corporation may lose market share and income from deposits, loans, and other products may be reduced.\nAdditionally, increased competition among financial services companies due to consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services.\nDowngrades in U.S. government and federal agency securities could adversely affect the Corporation.\nIn addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, any downgrades in U.S. government and federal agency securities, or failures to raise the U.S. debt limit if necessary in the future, could, among other things, have a materially adverse effect on the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition. In particular, it could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect profitability. Also, the adverse consequences of a downgrade could extend to the borrowers of the loans the bank makes and, as a result, could adversely affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans.\nThe Corporation is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s operations and prospects.\nThe Corporation currently depends on the services of a number of key management personnel. The loss of key personnel could materially and adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition. The Corporation\u2019s success also depends in part on the ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel. Competition for such personnel is strong and the Corporation may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel it requires.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock, like many of our peers, has fluctuated significantly over the recent past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nStock price volatility may make it difficult for holders of our common stock to resell their common stock when desired and at desirable prices. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022\nInaccurate management decisions regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired which could materially affect our financial condition;\n\u2022\nNatural disasters, fires, and severe weather;\n\u2022\nFailure of internal controls;\n\u2022\nRumors or erroneous information;\n\u2022\nReliance on other companies to provide key components of our business processes;\n\u2022\nMeeting capital adequacy standards and the need to raise additional capital in the future if needed, including through future sales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual results of operations;\n\u2022\nRecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nFailure of securities analysts to cover, or continue to cover, us;\n\u2022\nOperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nNews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including the failures of other financial institutions in the current economic downturn;\n\u2022\nPerceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nDeparture of our management team or other key personnel;\n\u2022\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nSignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nFailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nExisting or increased regulatory and compliance requirements, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations, or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nGovernmental investigations and actions;\n\u2022\nChanges in government regulations or restructuring of government sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac;\n\u2022\nNew litigation or changes in existing litigation; and\n\u2022\nGeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results as evidenced by the current volatility and disruption of capital and credit markets.\nWe may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends on common stock.\nOur shareholders are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we currently pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in Pennsylvania law, by the Federal Reserve, and by certain covenants contained in our subordinated debentures, and depends on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, debt service requirements, other cash needs and any other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Notification to the Federal Reserve is also required prior to our declaring and paying a cash dividend to our shareholders during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. We may not pay a dividend if the Federal Reserve objects or until such time as we receive approval from the Federal Reserve or we no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. In addition, we may be restricted by applicable law or regulation or actions taken by our regulators, now or in the future, from paying dividends to our shareholders. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue paying dividends on our common stock at current levels or at all. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends on our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nAny decisions to suspend or discontinue our stock repurchase plan could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nAlthough BMBC has previously repurchased its common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs, our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. A suspension or discontinuation of our stock repurchase plan could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Additionally, the existence of a stock repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the liquidity of our stock. As a result, any repurchase program may not ultimately result in enhanced value to our shareholders and may not prove to be the best use of our cash resources.\nBMBC\u2019s common stock is subordinate to all of our existing and future indebtedness; and we are not limited on the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur in the future.\nOur common stock ranks junior to all indebtedness, including our outstanding subordinated notes, junior subordinated debentures and other non-equity claims on BMBC with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on BMBC, including in a liquidation of BMBC. BMBC\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In addition, we are not limited by our common stock in the amount of debt or other obligations we or our subsidiaries may incur in the future. Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial amounts of additional debt and other obligations that will rank senior to our common stock or to which our common stock will be structurally subordinated.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or other securities. Further, our shareholders may in the future approve the authorization of additional classes or series of stock which may have distribution or other rights senior to the rights of our common stock, or may be convertible into or exchangeable for, or may represent the right to receive, common\nstock or substantially similar securities. The future issuance of shares of our common stock or any other such future equity classes or series could have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock. Additionally, the market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock, or any future class or series of stock in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur.", "PERMNO": 86124, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BMTC"}
