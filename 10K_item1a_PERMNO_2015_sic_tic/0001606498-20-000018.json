{"cik": "1606498", "company": "Avanos Medical, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces many risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in our other filings with the SEC, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. These risks are not the only ones we face. Other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe face strong competition. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur industry is highly competitive. We compete with many domestic and foreign companies ranging from small start-up enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment, to companies that are larger and more established than us, have a broad range of competitive products, participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We are also subject to potential competition from new technologies or new market entrants. Competitive factors include price, alternative clinical practices, innovation, quality and reputation. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in developing, acquiring or marketing competitive products and technologies.\nOur industry is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological advances. The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design, acquire and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products. Accordingly, we commit substantial time, funds and other resources to new product development, including research and development, acquisitions, licenses, clinical trials and physician education. We make these substantial expenditures without any assurance that our products will obtain regulatory clearance or reimbursement approval, acquire adequate intellectual property protection or receive market acceptance. Development by our competitors of improved products, technologies or enhancements may make our products, or those we develop, license or acquire in the future, obsolete or less competitive which could negatively impact our net sales. Our failure to successfully develop, acquire or market competitive\nnew products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.\nWe intend to supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions of, investments in and alliances with new medical technologies. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to identify and then properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. These types of transactions may require more resources and investments than originally anticipated, may divert management\u2019s attention from our existing business, may result in exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired business, and may not result in the expected benefits, savings or synergies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and successfully make strategic acquisitions of, investments in and alliances with new medical technologies or that any past or future acquisition, investment or alliance will be cost-effective, profitable or successful.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key employees necessary to be competitive.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees, including people in technical, marketing, sales, and research and development positions. Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons with specialized skills, can be intense. Our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location and work environment. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nAs we complete and stabilize our information technology infrastructure transition, we could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruption.\nPursuant to the sale of our Surgical & Infection Prevention business in 2018, we transferred ownership of our then existing information technology infrastructure to the Buyer and replaced such information technology infrastructure with new systems to support our critical business functions, including systems relating to accounting and reporting, accounts payable and receivable, manufacturing process control, customer service, inventory control and distribution. Although we have successfully completed the replacement process, we continue to work to stabilize the new system. We may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if we cannot effectively stabilize our existing transactional and operational systems and data centers. In addition, the stabilization process may result in (i) disruption to unrelated parts of our business, (ii) loss of employees or customers, (iii) exposure to unanticipated liabilities or (iv) assumption of ongoing obligations and liabilities following the completion of the process. Our failure to avoid operational interruptions, losses of employees or customers, or unanticipated liabilities as we seek to stabilize our information technology infrastructure could disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBreaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Our information technology systems may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts and cyber- or phishing-attacks. We also store certain information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks. These attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information, including personal health information, being lost or stolen, disruption of our operations, loss of reputation and other negative consequences, such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs and diversion of management attention. While we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect future cyber incidents, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. There can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property assets in the operation of our business. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or that patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or prevent competitors from introducing similar competing technologies. Our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside of the United States in which we operate, which could make it easier for our competitors to develop or distribute similar competing technologies in those jurisdictions. In addition, our competitive position may be adversely affected by expirations of our significant patents, which would allow competitors to freely use our technology to compete with us.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation and competitors may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Resolution of patent litigation or other intellectual property claims is inherently unpredictable, typically time consuming and costly and can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of the affected products or require us to make significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the\naffected products. Any one of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. At any given time we are involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. We can expect to face additional claims of patent infringement in the future.\nOur customers depend on third-party coverage and reimbursements. The failure of healthcare programs to provide coverage and reimbursement, or reductions in levels of reimbursement, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursements for products they purchase from us is important to our business. Demand for many of our existing and new medical products is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients\u2019 medical expenses in the countries where we do business. Any reduction in the amount of reimbursements received by our customers could harm our business by reducing their selection of our products and the prices they are willing to pay.\nIn addition, as a result of their purchasing power, third-party payors are implementing cost-cutting measures such as seeking discounts, price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursements for medical technologies and procedures. These trends could compel us to reduce prices for our existing products and potential new products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn inability to obtain key components, raw materials or manufactured products from third parties may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on the availability of various components, raw materials and manufactured products supplied by others for our operations, including suppliers who are based in or source their materials from China. If the capabilities of our suppliers and third-party manufacturers are limited or stopped, due to quality, regulatory or other reasons, including natural disasters, pandemics (or other health emergencies such as the recent \u201cCoronavirus\u201d outbreak), government actions, prolonged power or equipment failures or labor dispute, it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture or deliver our products and could expose us to regulatory actions. Further, for quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we purchase from sole suppliers certain components and raw materials. Although there are other sources in the market place for these items, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials due to regulations and requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products. The loss of any sole supplier or any sustained supply interruption that affects our ability to manufacture or deliver our products in a timely or cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn interruption in our ability to manufacture products may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our key products are manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities, including in certain cases by third-party manufacturers who are based in China. If one or more of these facilities experience damage, or if these manufacturing capabilities are otherwise limited or stopped due to quality, regulatory or other reasons, including natural disasters, pandemics (or other health emergencies such as the recent \u201cCoronavirus\u201d outbreak), government actions, prolonged power or equipment failures or labor dispute, it may not be possible to timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. A reduction or interruption in any of these manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn interruption in distribution or transportation may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on various transportation channels for global distribution of our products through shipping ports located throughout the world. Labor unrest, political instability, the outbreak of pandemics (or other health emergencies such as the recent \u201cCoronavirus\u201d outbreak), trade restrictions, transport capacity and costs, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters or other events could slow port activities and could adversely affect our business by interrupting product shipments and may increase our transportation costs if we are forced to use more expensive shipping alternatives.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the healthcare industry due to government healthcare reform in the United States and elsewhere.\nThe U.S. Congress, regulatory agencies and certain state legislatures, as well as international legislators and regulators, periodically review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. We cannot predict with certainty what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented by states or foreign governments or what ultimate effect federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions regarding our products. However, the implementation of new legislation and regulation may lower reimbursements for our products, reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, the United States Government periodically evaluates the potential repeal and potential replacement of all or parts of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (sometimes colloquially known as \u201cObamacare\u201d). Any such repeal or replacement may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance.\nMany of our products are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA and other regulatory authorities and by comparable government agencies in other countries concerning the development, design, approval, manufacture, labeling, importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products. Furthermore, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign government authorities, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, which requires periodic audits, design controls, quality control testing and documentation procedures, as well as complaint evaluations and investigation. Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical products are evolving and subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact those regulatory changes may have on our business. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages, delays in product manufacturing, product seizures, recalls, operating restrictions, withdrawal or suspension of required licenses, and prohibitions against exporting of products to, or importing products from, countries outside the United States and may require significant resources to resolve. Any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices or restrict our operations in the future.\nWe are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws and regulations are wide ranging and subject to changing interpretation and application, which could restrict our sales or marketing practices. Furthermore, since many of our customers rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs to cover a substantial portion of their expenditures, our exclusion from such programs as a result of a violation of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe must obtain clearance or approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to introducing a new product or a modification to an existing product. The regulatory clearance process may result in substantial costs, delays and limitations on the types and uses of products we can bring to market, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the United States, before we can market a new product, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we generally must first receive clearance or approval from the FDA and certain other regulatory authorities. Most major markets for medical devices outside the United States also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, require changes in products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. There can be no assurance that these clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, once a medical device has been cleared or approved, a new clearance or approval may be required before the medical device may be modified, its labeling changed or marketed for a different use. Medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and promoting a device for an off-label use could result in government enforcement action. Furthermore, a product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the medical device or issues relating to its application. The regulatory clearance and approval process may result in, among other things, delayed, if at all, realization of product net sales, substantial additional costs and limitations on the types of products we may bring to market or their indicated uses, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may incur product liability losses, litigation liability, product recalls, safety alerts or regulatory action associated with our products which can be costly and disruptive to our business.\nThe risk of product liability claims is inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical products of the type we produce and sell. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to the products that we manufacture or sell, including physician technique and experience in performing the relevant surgical procedure, component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or information.\nIn addition to product liability claims and litigation, an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient associated with our products could lead to a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, or suspension or delay of regulatory product approvals or clearances, product seizures or detentions, governmental investigations, civil or criminal sanctions or\ninjunctions to halt manufacturing and distribution of our products. Any one of these could result in significant costs and negative publicity resulting in reduced market acceptance and demand for our products and harm our reputation. In addition, a recall or injunction affecting our products could temporarily shut down production lines or place products on a shipping hold.\nAll of the foregoing types of legal proceedings and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the outcome, could disrupt our business, result in substantial costs or the diversion of management attention and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDisruptions in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges affecting the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe, Japan, China and other parts of the world may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Economic conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause our customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, and we have observed certain hospitals delaying and prioritizing purchasing decisions, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, as a result of economic conditions, our customers inside and outside the United States, including foreign governmental entities or other entities that rely on government healthcare systems or government funding, may be unable to pay their obligations on a timely basis or to make payment in full. If our customers\u2019 cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate or fail to improve, or if our customers are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us. These conditions also may have an adverse effect on certain of our suppliers who may reduce output or change terms of sales, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by our suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDue to our international operations, we transact business in many foreign currencies and are subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including the Mexican peso, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and the Euro. Our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars with international transactions being translated into U.S. dollars. If the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries where we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net sales and income will decrease. Additionally, we incur significant costs in foreign currencies and a fluctuation in those currencies\u2019 value can negatively impact manufacturing and selling costs. While we have in the past engaged, and may in the future engage, in various hedging transactions in attempts to minimize the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that these hedging transactions will be effective. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities, which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe rely on product inputs in the manufacture of our products. Prices of oil and gas affect our distribution and transportation costs. Prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years, which has contributed to, and in the future may continue to contribute to, fluctuations in our results of operations. Our ability to hedge commodity price volatility is limited. Furthermore, due to competitive dynamics, the cost containment efforts of our customers and third-party payors, and contractual limitations, particularly with respect to products we sell under group purchasing agreements, which generally set pricing for a three-year term, we may be unable to pass along commodity-driven cost increases through higher prices. If we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions, or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges, we could experience lower margins and profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCost-containment efforts of our customers, healthcare purchasing groups, third-party payors and governmental organizations could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nMany of our customers are members of GPOs, or integrated delivery networks (\u201cIDNs\u201d). GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. Although we are the sole contracted supplier to certain GPOs for certain product categories, members of the GPO are generally free to purchase from other suppliers, and such contract positions can offer no assurance that sales volumes of those products will be maintained. In addition, initiatives sponsored by government agencies and other third-party payors to limit healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive bidding for the sale of our products, are ongoing in markets where we sell our products. Pricing pressure has also increased in our markets due to consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, governments becoming payors of healthcare expenses and regulation relating to reimbursements.\nThe increasing leverage of organized buying groups and consolidated customers and pricing pressure from third-party payors may reduce market prices for our products, thereby reducing our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to political, economic and regulatory risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nMost of our manufacturing facilities are outside the United States in Mexico, France, Germany and Tunisia. We also may use contract manufacturers outside the United States from time to time and may source many of our raw materials and components from foreign suppliers. We distribute and sell our products in over 90 countries. In 2019, approximately 23% of our net sales were generated outside of North America and we expect this percentage will grow over time. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with both United States and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include robust data privacy requirements, labor relations laws that may impede employer flexibility, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import, customs and trade restrictions, export requirements, economic sanction laws, environmental, health and safety laws, anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be violated inadvertently or through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. In addition, these laws are subject to changes, which may require additional resources or make it more difficult for us to comply with these laws. Violations of the laws and regulations governing our international operations could result in fines or criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to manufacture or distribute our products in one or more countries and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and prevent or mitigate these risks and manage difficulties as they arise.\nWe may be subject to trade protection measures that are being contemplated by the United States Government and other governments around the world, as well as potential disruptions in trade agreements such as the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. These measures and disruptions may result in new or higher tariffs, import-export restrictions and taxes. Changes in, or revised interpretations of import-export laws or international trade agreements, along with new or increased tariffs, trade restrictions or taxation on income earned or goods manufactured outside the United States may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to the foregoing, engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent local medical practices, product preferences and product requirements,\n\u2022\nprice and currency controls and exchange rate fluctuations,\n\u2022\ncost and availability of international shipping channels,\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles in certain countries other than the United States,\n\u2022\nminimal or diminished protection of intellectual property in certain countries,\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding judicial systems, including difficulties in enforcing agreements through certain non-U.S. legal systems,\n\u2022\npolitical instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, expropriation of assets, economic instability and the impact on interest rates, inflation and the credit worthiness of our customers, and\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing non-U.S. operations.\nThese risks and difficulties, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have a significant amount of debt that could adversely affect our business.\nOur $250 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes, and any use of the borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit, could have important consequences to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt,\n\u2022\nreducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business,\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions,\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk of a future downgrade of our credit rating, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing,\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged.\nTo the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.\nWe may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue our research and development activities and make acquisitions. Accordingly, we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we lose a previously assigned credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Avanos Common Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock price will not decline or fluctuate significantly.\nThe price at which Avanos common stock trades has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price, or fluctuations in price, for Avanos common stock may be negatively influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results,\n\u2022\nour failure to achieve the quarterly financial results forecast provided from time to time by the securities analysts who cover our stock,\n\u2022\nthe outcome of litigation and enforcement actions,\n\u2022\ndevelopments generally affecting the healthcare industry,\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of comparable companies,\n\u2022\nthe amount of our indebtedness,\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions,\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for Avanos common stock,\n\u2022\nprice fluctuations in key commodities,\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates,\n\u2022\nour dividend policy, and\n\u2022\nperceptions of or speculations by the press or investment community.\nThese and other factors may lower the market price of Avanos common stock, regardless of our actual financial condition or operating performance.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on Avanos common stock.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on Avanos common stock. Any determination to pay dividends to holders of Avanos common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, projections, liquidity, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions in our debt agreements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nThe percentage of ownership of existing stockholders in Avanos may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, a stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership in Avanos may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and employees. In addition, our compensation committee has, and we anticipate that they will continue in the future to, grant stock options or other equity based awards to our employees. These awards will have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders and on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of Avanos common stock.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of Avanos stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over Avanos common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. If our Board of Directors were to approve the issuance of preferred stock in the future, the terms of one or more classes or series of such preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Avanos common stock. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to Avanos preferred stock could affect the residual value of Avanos common stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and of Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts which some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial.\nCertain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and those contained in Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nthe division of our Board of Directors into three classes, each with three-year staggered terms,\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval,\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders,\n\u2022\nstockholder action may be taken only at a special or regular meeting of stockholders,\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our Board of Directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings,\n\u2022\nstockholder removal of directors only for cause and only by a supermajority vote,\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors, and not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors, and\n\u2022\nsupermajority voting requirements to amend our by-laws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and to engage in certain types of business combinations.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable the Board of Directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. We are also subject to Delaware laws that could have similar effects. One of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met.", "PERMNO": 14941, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "AVNS"}
