{"cik": "1009626", "company": "BROCADE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nFailure to successfully compete in the networking market could prevent Brocade from increasing or maintaining revenue, profitability, and cash flows with respect to its networking solutions.\nThe networking market, particularly the data center market, is highly competitive and is undergoing significant transitions due to the adoption of new technologies, such as cloud computing, virtualization, software networking, and infrastructure-as-a-service. For example, both Cisco Systems, Inc. (\u201cCisco\u201d) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (\u201cHPE\u201d) recently began to offer cloud computing services for the enterprise market, which some customers may choose as an alternative means to procure networking as a service rather than by traditional purchasing methods. Cisco and Microsoft Corporation have also collaborated on data center and cloud computing initiatives involving sales, marketing, and research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d). Additionally, Dell Inc. (\u201cDell\u201d) recently announced an agreement to acquire EMC Corporation (\u201cEMC\u201d), and if that acquisition is completed, the resulting company\u2019s technology may compete directly with some of Brocade\u2019s solutions. Also, Juniper Networks, Inc. (\u201cJuniper\u201d) and HPE have launched new offerings, including \u201cwhitebox\u201d switches, which those companies have promoted as a low-cost option for networking equipment purchasers. Further commoditization of networking products could negatively impact Brocade\u2019s business and financial results.\nOther shifts in the networking market are also creating competitive challenges for Brocade. For example, data center buying patterns are shifting to converged infrastructures in which computer, network, and storage systems are sold as bundled solutions. If Brocade is unsuccessful in having its products included in those bundled solutions, Brocade\u2019s market share could be adversely affected. In addition, some new storage technologies, such as solid-state drives and hyper-converged network solutions that use software-defined storage, reduce the overall port demand for networking products. Also, the market for campus networking products is increasingly based on the use of wireless campus technologies, which are not included in Brocade\u2019s product portfolio. The success of Brocade\u2019s wireline campus business is due in part to the partnering relationships it has developed with wireless campus vendors. Those partnering relationships have been adversely affected, and may continue to be adversely affected, by the fact that some of those vendors compete with Brocade in other market segments, some of those vendors have been acquired, or may in the future be acquired, by other companies with their own wireline products, and some of those vendors have limited market share and/or relationships with many other providers of wireline campus products.\nCisco maintains a dominant position in the networking market; however, customers also have many choices in both traditional and emerging networking technology and networking providers. These other competitors in the networking market include A10 Networks, Inc.; Alcatel-Lucent; Arista Networks, Inc.; Avaya Inc.; Extreme Networks, Inc.; Networks, Inc.; Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.; Juniper; and QLogic Corporation (\u201cQLogic\u201d). Many of Brocade\u2019s competitors have longer operating histories; greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources; more name recognition; and larger customer installed bases than Brocade. These companies\u2019 businesses may have better economies of scale, and therefore these companies could also adopt more aggressive pricing policies than Brocade. Some of these companies\u2019 brands are better known by end users than Brocade\u2019s brand, and channel partners often prefer to direct well-known brands to end user accounts. In addition, these companies have in the past, and could in the future, enhance their business models through divestitures and acquisitions, which could impact Brocade\u2019s partner ecosystem and Brocade\u2019s go-to-market model. Also, any one of these competitors could devote more resources to develop, promote, and sell their products, and, therefore, could respond more quickly to changes in customer or market requirements and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Brocade\u2019s failure to successfully compete in the networking market would harm its business and financial results.\nBrocade\u2019s failure to execute on its overall sales strategy or successfully leverage its channel and direct sales capabilities could significantly reduce its revenues and negatively affect its business, financial results, and growth prospects.\nBrocade offers networking solutions through a multipath distribution strategy, including distributors, resellers, a direct sales force, and original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d). However, Brocade\u2019s efforts to increase sales through this multipath distribution strategy may not generate incremental revenue opportunities. Several of Brocade\u2019s major OEM customers, including Dell, International Business Machines Corporation (\u201cIBM\u201d), HPE, and Oracle Corporation, have acquired companies that offer Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) Networking solutions that are competitive with Brocade offerings. A loss of, or significant reduction in, revenue through one of Brocade\u2019s paths to market would negatively impact its business and financial results.\nAs the networking industry continues to evolve, partners with which Brocade does not have long-standing relationships, such as cloud service providers that provide routing and infrastructure-as-a-service and global systems integrators that provide complete solutions to end users interested in upgrading to more modern architectures, may become increasingly important. In addition, as more enterprises purchase infrastructure-as-a-service offerings from hyperscale cloud providers and large service providers, sales through some of Brocade\u2019s existing paths to market could decline. If Brocade fails to build or grow successful relationships with these partners and service providers, Brocade\u2019s business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nBrocade\u2019s failure to successfully develop new and/or maintain its current channel partner relationships, or the failure of these partners to sell Brocade\u2019s products, could reduce Brocade\u2019s growth prospects significantly. In addition, Brocade\u2019s ability to respond to the needs of its distribution and reseller partners in the future may also depend on third parties producing complementary products and applications for Brocade products to enable these partners to be competitive in the market. In addition, Brocade may not successfully achieve its expanded go-to-market objectives, which include effectively maintaining or expanding sales through its distribution channels and successfully managing distribution and reseller partner relationships. If Brocade fails to respond successfully to the needs of these distribution and reseller partners and their customers, Brocade\u2019s business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn fiscal years 2013 and 2014, Brocade made certain changes in its strategic direction and sales strategy by focusing on key technology segments for the data center, such as its Storage Area Networking (\u201cSAN\u201d) fabrics, Ethernet fabrics, and software networking solutions, and targeting larger IP customers with its direct sales force. This change in focus has resulted in a rebalancing of resources away from certain non-key areas of Brocade\u2019s business, including changes to the related sales model and divestitures of certain assets, and has impacted, and may continue to impact, Brocade\u2019s ability to generate revenue from certain products, markets, geographies, and customers. In addition, the targeting of larger IP customers may cause Brocade\u2019s revenue to be more uneven in the future as timing and magnitude of individual customer orders may be difficult to predict.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, Brocade made a strategic decision to reduce its investment in the hardware-based application delivery controller product line and to increase investment in the software-based application delivery controller product line. As a result of this change in strategy, hardware-based Brocade ADX and related support revenue decreased by approximately $20 million in fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013. Hardware-based Brocade ADX and related support revenue further declined by approximately $2 million in fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014. There can be no assurance that this new strategic direction and sales strategy will succeed in the long term, or that the return on Brocade\u2019s investments will continue to develop in the manner and on the timeline expected. Failure to execute on Brocade\u2019s strategy could adversely affect its business and financial results.\nA limited number of major OEM partners comprise a significant portion of Brocade\u2019s revenues; the loss of revenue from, or decreased inventory levels held by, any of these major OEM partners could significantly reduce Brocade\u2019s revenues and adversely affect its financial results.\nBrocade\u2019s SAN business depends on recurring purchases from a limited number of large OEM partners for a substantial portion of its revenues, specifically EMC, HPE, and IBM. As a result, revenues from these large OEM partners have a significant impact on Brocade\u2019s quarterly and annual financial results. For fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, these three OEM partners each represented 10% or more of Brocade\u2019s total net revenues, for a combined total of 41%, 46%, and 46% of total net revenues, respectively. Brocade\u2019s agreements with its OEM partners are typically cancellable, nonexclusive, and have no minimum or specific timing requirements for purchases. Brocade\u2019s OEM partners could increase the amount purchased from Brocade\u2019s competitors, introduce their own technology, or experience lower demand for Brocade SAN products from their end customers. The SAN market contracted in 2015, and if the SAN market continues to contract, Brocade\u2019s OEM partners could reduce the amount of SAN products they purchase from Brocade.\nAlso, one or more of Brocade\u2019s OEM partners could elect to divest certain lines of business, split their business, or consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of Brocade\u2019s competitors, such as IBM\u2019s sale of certain lines of business to Lenovo Group Limited, HPE\u2019s recently completed separation into two public companies, or Dell\u2019s announced agreement to acquire EMC, which could reduce or eliminate Brocade\u2019s future revenue opportunities with that OEM partner. In addition, business execution or other operating performance issues experienced by our OEM partners may adversely affect Brocade\u2019s revenue and financial results. Brocade anticipates that a significant portion of its revenues and operating results from its SAN business will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of OEM partners. Brocade\u2019s business and financial results could be harmed by the loss of any one significant OEM partner, a decrease in the level of sales to any one such partner, a change in any one such partner\u2019s go-to-market strategy, or an unsuccessful negotiation on key terms, conditions, or timing of purchase orders placed during a quarter.\nUncertainty about or a slowdown in the domestic and international economies has adversely affected, and may increasingly adversely affect, Brocade\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nIn recent years, there have been various slowdowns in, and uncertainty about, the domestic and international economies, including slowing economic growth in China. Such uncertainty and slowdowns have resulted in, and may again result in, lower growth of information technology (\u201cIT\u201d)-related spending, and, consequently, lead to lower growth or a decline in the networking market (including high-performance data networking solutions). Historically, IT spending has declined as general economic and market conditions have worsened due to geopolitical uncertainty. In addition, IT spending by international customers may decline as the value of the local currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar. Brocade is particularly susceptible to reductions in IT spending because the purchase of networking solutions is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. The loss or delay of orders from any of Brocade\u2019s more significant customers, such as individual branches or agencies within the U.S. federal government (including the Department of Defense or certain intelligence agencies where Brocade\u2019s revenue is concentrated), or customers within the service provider, financial services, education (including the U.S. federal government program commonly known as the E-Rate program), and health sectors, could also cause Brocade\u2019s revenue and profitability to suffer. For example, Brocade\u2019s revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted if the U.S. federal government experiences delays in procurement due to longer decision-making time frames and/or a shift in IT procurement priorities. Economic uncertainty has caused-and may cause further-reductions in Brocade\u2019s revenue, profitability, and cash flows, along with increased price competition, increased operating costs, and longer fulfillment cycles. Moreover, economic uncertainty may exacerbate many other risks noted elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which could adversely affect Brocade\u2019s business operations and financial condition.\nThe prices of Brocade\u2019s products have declined in the past and Brocade expects the prices of its products to decline in the future, which could reduce Brocade\u2019s revenues, gross margins, and profitability.\nThe average selling price for Brocade products has typically declined in the past and will likely decline in the future as a result of competitive pricing pressures, broader macroeconomic factors, product mix, new product introductions by Brocade or competitors, the entrance of new competitors, and other factors. In particular, if economic conditions deteriorate and create a more cautious capital spending environment in the IT sector, Brocade and its competitors could pursue more aggressive pricing strategies in an effort to maintain or increase revenues. If Brocade is unable to offset a decline in the average selling price of Brocade products by increasing the volume of products shipped and/or reducing product manufacturing costs, including key components such as optics, Brocade\u2019s revenues, gross margins, and profitability could be adversely affected.\nBrocade\u2019s future revenue growth depends on its ability to successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products, services, and support offerings on a timely basis.\nDeveloping new products, services (including software networking), and support offerings requires significant up-front investments that may not result in revenues for an extended period of time, if at all. Brocade must achieve market acceptance of its new product and support offerings on a timely basis in order to realize the benefits of its investments. However, the market for networking solutions, driven in part by the growth and evolution of the Internet and adoption of new technologies such as software-defined networking (\u201cSDN\u201d) and network functions virtualization (\u201cNFV\u201d), is characterized by rapidly changing technology, accelerated product introduction cycles, changes in customer requirements, and evolving industry standards. In addition, many of Brocade\u2019s new products, services, and support offerings will be directed towards customers, including hyperscale cloud providers and large service providers, with which Brocade does not have strong existing sales relationships. Sales to these customers can be challenging because sales are often based on long-term relationships and network incumbency and the complex system environments maintained by these customers often require interoperation with a variety of other vendors and back office applications. Brocade\u2019s future success depends largely upon its ability to address the rapidly changing needs of both new and existing customers by: allowing connectivity to other devices and partnering effectively; keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards; and delivering high-quality, reliable, and cost-effective products, product enhancements, and services and support offerings on a timely basis.\nOther factors that may affect Brocade\u2019s successful introduction of new products, services, and support offerings include, but are not limited to, Brocade\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nProperly determine the market for new products, services, and support offerings, including features, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and pricing-all of which can be particularly challenging for initial product offerings in new markets;\n\u2022\nDifferentiate Brocade\u2019s new products, services, and support offerings from its competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u2022\nAddress the interoperability complexities of Brocade\u2019s products with its OEM partners\u2019 server and storage products and Brocade\u2019s competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nDetermine which route(s) to market will be effective; and\n\u2022\nManage product transitions, including forecasting demand, managing excess and obsolete inventories, addressing product cost structures, and managing different sales and support requirements.\nFailure to successfully introduce competitive products, services, and support offerings on a timely basis may harm Brocade\u2019s business and adversely affect Brocade\u2019s financial results.\nIf Brocade is unable to successfully transition from older products and corresponding support and service offerings to new products and corresponding support and service offerings on a timely basis, its business and financial results could be harmed.\nAs Brocade introduces new or enhanced products, it must successfully manage the transition from older products, such as certain SAN products, to minimize disruption in customers\u2019 ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories, maintain existing support revenue streams, and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of Brocade\u2019s existing products or replace the sales of some of Brocade\u2019s current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of a successful product introduction. When Brocade introduces new or enhanced products, it faces numerous risks related to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new or enhanced products. In addition, any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products, or Brocade\u2019s plans for future support of existing products, may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or to purchase competing products, which would adversely affect Brocade\u2019s business and financial results.\nBrocade may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures, and strategic investments, and the integration of acquired companies or technologies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact Brocade\u2019s business and financial results.\nBrocade has acquired-or made strategic investments in-other companies, products, or technologies, and Brocade expects to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, Brocade acquired Connectem Inc. and Riverbed Technology, Inc.\u2019s SteelAppTM product line and related assets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, Brocade acquired the Vistapointe business. The ability of Brocade to realize the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions and strategic investments involves numerous risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nDifficulties in successfully integrating the acquired businesses and realizing any expected synergies;\n\u2022\nFailure to communicate to customers the capabilities of the combined company;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated costs, litigation, and other contingent liabilities, including liabilities associated with acquired intellectual property;\n\u2022\nDiversion of management\u2019s attention from Brocade\u2019s daily operations and business;\n\u2022\nAdverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, including delays or cancellations of customer purchases, as well as revenue attrition in excess of anticipated levels if existing customers alter or reduce their historical buying patterns;\n\u2022\nRisks associated with entering into markets in which Brocade has limited or no prior experience, including potentially less visibility into demand;\n\u2022\nInability to attract and retain key employees;\n\u2022\nInability to successfully develop new products and services on a timely basis to address the market opportunities of the combined company;\n\u2022\nInability to compete effectively against companies already serving the broader market opportunities expected to be available to the combined company;\n\u2022\nInability to qualify the combined company\u2019s products with OEM partners on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u2022\nInability to successfully integrate financial reporting and IT systems;\n\u2022\nInability to develop software-oriented back office systems and processes necessary to sell and support a variety of software-based offerings;\n\u2022\nFailure to successfully manage additional business locations, including the infrastructure and resources necessary to support and integrate such locations;\n\u2022\nAssumption or incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and related obligations to service such liabilities and potential limitations on Brocade\u2019s operations in order to satisfy financial and other negative operating covenants;\n\u2022\nAdditional costs, such as increased costs of manufacturing and service; costs associated with excess or obsolete inventory; costs of employee redeployment, relocation, and retention, including salary increases or bonuses; accelerated amortization of deferred equity compensation, severance payments, reorganization, or closure of facilities; taxes; advisor and professional fees; and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services;\n\u2022\nIncurrence of acquisition- and integration-related costs, goodwill or in-process research and development impairment charges, or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets, that could negatively impact Brocade\u2019s operating results and financial condition; and\n\u2022\nThe target market for the acquired products may not develop within the expected time frame or may evolve in a different technical direction.\nBrocade may also divest certain businesses or product lines from time to time. For example, Brocade sold its network adapter business to QLogic during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. Such divestitures involve risks, such as difficulty separating out portions of or entire businesses, distracting employees, incurring potential loss of revenue, negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. Brocade may also incur significant costs associated with exit or disposal activities, related impairment charges, or both.\nCyberattacks and data security breaches could disrupt Brocade\u2019s operations, negatively impact Brocade\u2019s reputation, and erode customers\u2019 trust.\nCyberattacks and other malicious attacks could lead to data breaches, computer break-ins, malware, viruses, and unauthorized tampering with Brocade\u2019s computer systems, intellectual property, and confidential information of Brocade, its customers, and partners. These attacks could disrupt Brocade\u2019s operations, negatively impact Brocade\u2019s reputation, and erode customers\u2019 trust. Brocade may not successfully limit attacks by malicious third parties if they attempt to undermine or disrupt Brocade\u2019s cybersecurity, despite implementation of cybersecurity measures. Additionally, Brocade may suffer reputational harm as a result of a data security breach involving customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 information, either or both of which could negatively impact profitability and/or increase expenses. Customers have become increasingly sensitive to government-sponsored surveillance and may believe that, as a U.S.-based manufacturer, Brocade\u2019s equipment contains \u201cbackdoor\u201d code that would allow customer data to be compromised by either governmental bodies or other third parties. As a result, customers may choose not to deploy Brocade networking products, which could negatively impact Brocade\u2019s business and financial results.\nBrocade has a substantial amount of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, and deferred tax assets on its balance sheet, and if Brocade is required to record impairment charges for these assets, such impairment charges could adversely affect Brocade\u2019s financial results.\nBrocade has a substantial amount of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, and deferred tax assets on its balance sheet related to Brocade\u2019s prior acquisitions. Brocade\u2019s determination of the fair value of its long-lived assets relies on management\u2019s assumptions of future revenues, operating costs, and other relevant factors. Brocade\u2019s estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of Brocade\u2019s carrying basis of assets, including acquired intangible assets, could change as a result of changes in management\u2019s assumptions. If management\u2019s estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions, such as the discount rate applied to future cash flows, then the estimated fair value of Brocade\u2019s reporting units could change significantly, which could result in goodwill impairment charges. For example, based on the decrease in the hardware-based Brocade ADX revenue forecast, Brocade recognized an $83.4 million goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. For a sensitivity analysis that quantifies the impact of key assumptions used by Brocade on certain reporting units\u2019 fair value estimates, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. If future impairment tests should result in a charge to earnings, Brocade\u2019s financial results would be adversely affected.\nBrocade has determined that, more likely than not, it will realize its deferred tax assets based on positive evidence of its historical operations and projections of future income, except for the deferred tax assets related to California and remaining capital loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance has been applied. In the event that future income by jurisdiction is less than what is currently projected, Brocade may be required to apply a valuation allowance to these deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where realization of such assets is no longer more likely than not, which could result in a charge to earnings that would adversely affect Brocade\u2019s financial results.\nIf Brocade loses key employees or is unable to hire additional qualified employees, its business may be negatively impacted.\nBrocade\u2019s success depends, to a significant degree, upon the continued contributions of its employees, including executive officers, engineering, sales, and others, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Departures, appointments, and changes in roles and responsibilities of officers or other key members of management may disrupt Brocade\u2019s business and adversely affect Brocade\u2019s operating results.\nBrocade believes its future success depends, in large part, upon its ability to attract highly skilled employees and operate effectively in geographically diverse locations. Brocade has relied on equity awards in the form of stock options and restricted stock units as one means for recruiting and retaining highly skilled employees. The number of shares available for issuance under Brocade\u2019s 2009 Stock Plan is limited, and any increase in the number of shares available under that plan must be approved by Brocade\u2019s stockholders. The extent to which Brocade is able to obtain such stockholder approval depends on a variety of factors, including assessments by stockholders and proxy advisory firms of Brocade\u2019s historical equity award granting practices. The effectiveness of these equity awards in recruiting and retaining employees could be reduced if Brocade has to reduce the size of the equity awards granted to its employees or if there is a sustained decline in the trading price of Brocade\u2019s shares. There is also limited qualified employees in each of Brocade\u2019s markets, and competition for such employees is very aggressive. In particular, Brocade operates in various locations with highly competitive labor markets, including Bangalore, India, and San Jose, California. Brocade may experience difficulty in hiring key management and qualified employees with skills in nearly all areas of Brocade\u2019s business and operations.\nThe loss of the services of any of Brocade\u2019s key employees, the inability to attract or retain qualified employees in the future, or delays in hiring required employees-particularly sales and engineering employees-could delay the development and introduction of Brocade\u2019s products or services and/or negatively affect its ability to sell products or services.\nFailure to accurately forecast demand for Brocade\u2019s products, or failure to successfully manage the production of its products, could increase Brocade\u2019s product cost and adversely affect its margins and profitability.\nBrocade provides product forecasts to its contract manufacturers (\u201cCMs\u201d) and places purchase orders with them in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to Brocade\u2019s customers. In preparing sales and demand forecasts, Brocade relies largely on input from its sales force, partners, resellers, and end-user customers. If Brocade is unable to accurately forecast demand, or if Brocade fails to effectively communicate with its distribution partners about end-user demand or other time-sensitive information, Brocade\u2019s ability to successfully manage production could be negatively impacted. Brocade\u2019s ability to accurately forecast demand also may become increasingly limited as Brocade introduces new or enhanced products, begins phasing out certain products, or acquires other companies or businesses. If these forecasts are inaccurate, Brocade may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from its CMs to meet customers\u2019 delivery requirements, or Brocade may accumulate excess inventories or incur costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity. If excess inventories accumulate, Brocade\u2019s gross margins may be negatively impacted by write-downs for excess and/or obsolete inventory. In addition, Brocade will experience higher fixed costs as it expands its CMs\u2019 capabilities for forecasted demand, which could negatively affect Brocade\u2019s margins if demand decreases suddenly and Brocade is unable to reduce these fixed costs.\nAdditionally, most of Brocade\u2019s manufacturing overhead and expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of receipt of corresponding revenue, and Brocade may not be able to reduce such expenses sufficiently to offset declining product prices. As a result, Brocade\u2019s gross margins may be adversely affected by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes, component costs, foreign currency exchange rates, the mix of product configurations sold, and the mix of distribution channels through which its products are sold. Brocade\u2019s gross margins may also be adversely affected if product or related warranty costs associated with Brocade\u2019s products are greater than previously experienced.\nBrocade has extensive international operations, which expose its business and operations to additional risks.\nBrocade has significant international operations, and a significant portion of Brocade\u2019s sales occur in international jurisdictions. In addition, Brocade\u2019s CMs have significant operations in China and other locations outside the U.S. Brocade\u2019s international sales of its IP Networking solutions have primarily depended on its distributors and resellers. Maintenance or expansion of international sales or international operations involves inherent risks that Brocade may not be able to control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nDifficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners in certain emerging markets;\n\u2022\nExposure to economic instability or fluctuations in international markets, such as China, that could cause reductions in IT spending;\n\u2022\nExposure to inflationary risks and/or wage inflation in certain countries, such as India;\n\u2022\nIncreased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including currencies such as the British pound, the euro, the Indian rupee, the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, the Singapore dollar, and the Swiss franc;\n\u2022\nExposure to sovereign debt risk and political and economic instability in certain regions of Europe, including Russia, and certain emerging countries, including China and Brazil;\n\u2022\nMultiple potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws, regulations, and practices, including differing environmental, data privacy, export, import, trade, manufacturing, tax, labor, and employment laws;\n\u2022\nCompliance with U.S. and other applicable government regulation of exports and imports, and associated licensing requirements, particularly in the area of encryption technology;\n\u2022\nCompliance with U.S. and other applicable government regulations prohibiting certain end-uses and restricting trade with embargoed or sanctioned countries, such as Russia, and with denied parties;\n\u2022\nReduced or limited protection of intellectual property rights, particularly in jurisdictions that have less developed intellectual property regimes, such as China and India;\n\u2022\nCommercial laws and business practices that favor local competition;\n\u2022\nIn certain international regions, particularly those with rapidly developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022\nIncreased complexity, time, and costs of managing international operations;\n\u2022\nManaging research and development and sales teams in geographically diverse locations, including teams divided between the United States, the United Kingdom, and India;\n\u2022\nEffective communications across multiple geographies, cultures, and languages;\n\u2022\nRecruiting sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell, and support Brocade\u2019s products in international markets;\n\u2022\nLonger sales cycles and manufacturing lead times;\n\u2022\nIncreased complexity and cost of providing customer support and maintenance for international customers;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nIncreased complexity of logistics and distribution arrangements; and\n\u2022\nIncreased complexity of accounting rules and financial reporting requirements.\nAny of these factors could negatively impact Brocade\u2019s business, revenues, and profitability.\nBrocade\u2019s revenues, operating results, and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, which makes predicting financial results difficult.\nIT spending is subject to cyclical and uneven fluctuations, which could cause Brocade\u2019s financial results to fluctuate unevenly and unpredictably. For example, the U.S. federal budget for government IT spending can be highly seasonal and subject to delays, reductions, and uncertainty due to changes in the political and legislative environment. It can be difficult to predict the degree to which end-customer demand and the seasonality and uneven sales patterns of Brocade\u2019s OEM partners or other customers will affect Brocade\u2019s business in the future, particularly as Brocade releases new or enhanced products. While Brocade\u2019s first and fourth fiscal quarters are typically stronger quarters for SAN products and Brocade\u2019s third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically stronger quarters for IP Networking solutions, future buying patterns may differ from historical seasonality. If the mix of revenue changes, it may also cause results to differ from historical seasonality. Accordingly, Brocade\u2019s quarterly and annual revenues, operating results, cash flows, and other financial and operating metrics may vary significantly in the future, and the results of any prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nIf product orders are received late in a fiscal quarter, Brocade may be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same quarter, which could adversely affect quarterly financial results.\nBrocade\u2019s IP Networking business typically experiences significantly higher levels of customer orders toward the end of a fiscal period. Customer orders received toward the end of the period may not ship within the period due to a lack of available inventory and manufacturing lead times. The inability to ship within the quarter in which the customer orders are received could negatively impact Brocade\u2019s financial results in a particular quarter.\nBrocade is subject to-and will continue to be subject to-intellectual property infringement claims and litigation that are costly to defend and/or settle, which could result in significant damages and other costs to Brocade and limit Brocade\u2019s ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nBrocade competes in markets in which companies are frequently subject to claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Third parties have from time to time asserted patent, copyright, trade secret, and/or other intellectual property-related claims against Brocade and/or employees of Brocade. These claims may be, and have been in the past, made against Brocade\u2019s products and services, subcomponents of its products, methods performed by its products or a combination of products, including third-party products, methods used in its operations, or uses of its products by its customers. The claimant may seek various remedies against Brocade, such as money damages, disgorgement of profits, injunctions barring sales of infringing goods, or exclusion orders barring imports of product into the U.S., among other possible remedies. Moreover, these claims may concern Brocade\u2019s hiring of a former employee of the third-party claimant. Brocade and companies acquired by Brocade have in the past incurred, and will likely incur in the future, substantial expenses to defend against such third-party claims. Brocade\u2019s suppliers and customers also may be subject to third-party intellectual property claims with respect to their own products, which could negatively impact the suppliers\u2019 ability to supply Brocade with components or customers\u2019 willingness to purchase products from Brocade. In addition, Brocade may be subject to claims, defenses, and indemnification obligations with respect to third-party intellectual property rights pursuant to Brocade\u2019s agreements with suppliers, OEM and channel partners, or customers. If Brocade refuses to indemnify or defend such claims, for instance, even in situations where the allegations are meritless, then suppliers, partners, or customers may refuse to do business with Brocade. Parties that assert such intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands, or may simply refuse to settle, which could lead to prolonged periods of litigation, additional burdens on employees or other resources, distraction from Brocade\u2019s business operations, component supply stoppages, expensive settlement payments, and lost sales. Furthermore, there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for licenses and/or settlement fees, which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees. Any of the above scenarios could have an adverse effect on Brocade\u2019s financial position, financial results, cash flows, and future business prospects.\nUndetected software or hardware errors could increase Brocade\u2019s costs, reduce its revenues, and delay market acceptance of its products.\nNetworking products frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as new versions are released. As Brocade continues to expand its product portfolio to include software-centric products, which may include software licensed from third parties, errors may be found from time to time in these products. In addition, through its acquisitions, Brocade has assumed-and may in the future assume-products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been through the same level of product development, testing, and quality control processes used by Brocade, and may have known and/or undetected errors. Some types of errors may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. In addition, Brocade products are often combined with other products, including software from other vendors, and these products often need to interoperate. For IT products that have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, or may be procured from other vendors, it may be difficult to identify the source of any problems. Identifying the source of and remediating these problems may cause Brocade to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts, and cause significant customer relations problems, resulting in lower profitability from increased costs and/or decreased revenue. Moreover, the occurrence of hardware and software errors, whether caused by Brocade products or another vendor\u2019s products, could delay market acceptance of new or enhanced Brocade products.\nBrocade\u2019s supply chain is dependent on sole-source and limited-source suppliers and a limited number of major CMs, either one or both of which may significantly impact Brocade\u2019s financial results.\nAlthough Brocade uses standard parts and components for its products where possible, Brocade\u2019s CMs currently purchase, on Brocade\u2019s behalf, several key components used in the manufacture of its products from single or limited supplier sources. Brocade\u2019s single-source components include, but are not limited to, its application-specific integrated circuits (commonly referred to as \u201cASICs\u201d). Brocade\u2019s principal limited-source components include memory, certain oscillators, microprocessors, certain connectors, certain logic chips, power supplies, programmable logic devices, printed circuit boards, certain optical components, packet processors, and switch fabric components. Brocade generally acquires these components through purchase orders and has no long-term commitments regarding supply or pricing with such suppliers. If Brocade is unable to obtain these and other components when required, or if Brocade\u2019s suppliers experience component defects, Brocade may not be able to deliver its products to customers in a timely manner and may be required to repair or retrofit products previously delivered to customers, at significant expense to Brocade. In addition, a challenging economic or industry environment could cause some of these sole-source or limited-source suppliers to delay or halt production, go out of business, or be acquired by third parties, which could result in a disruption in Brocade\u2019s supply chain. Brocade\u2019s supply chain could also be disrupted in a variety of other circumstances that may impact its suppliers and partners, including adverse results from intellectual property litigation or natural disasters. Any manufacturing disruption by these sole-source or limited-source suppliers could severely impair Brocade\u2019s ability to fulfill orders and may significantly impact its financial results.\nIn addition, the loss of any of Brocade\u2019s major CMs, or portions of their capacity, could significantly impact Brocade\u2019s ability to produce its products for an indefinite period of time. Qualifying a new CM and commencing volume production is typically a lengthy and expensive process. A CM may move the production lines for Brocade\u2019s products to new locations or factories, and this may result in delays or disruptions. If Brocade changes any of its CMs or if any of its CMs experience unplanned delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, component parts shortages, or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, shipment of Brocade\u2019s products to customers could be delayed and result in loss of revenues.\nBrocade\u2019s intellectual property rights may be infringed upon or misappropriated by others, and Brocade may not be able to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights.\nBrocade\u2019s intellectual property rights may be infringed upon or misappropriated by others, including by competitors, partners, former employees, foreign governments, or other third parties. In some cases, such infringement or misappropriation may be undetectable, or enforcement of Brocade\u2019s intellectual property rights may be impractical. Brocade has filed, and may in the future file, lawsuits against third parties in an effort to enforce its intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and unpredictable. There can be no assurance that Brocade will prevail in such assertions or enforcement efforts, either on the merits, or with respect to particular relief sought, such as damages or an injunction. Nor can there be any assurance that any awarded damages ultimately will be paid to Brocade. Furthermore, the opposing party may attempt to prove that the asserted intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable, and, if successful, may seek recompense for its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs or countersue Brocade as part of its defense. Finally, there can be no assurance that any attempt by Brocade to enforce its intellectual property rights, even if successful in court, will improve Brocade\u2019s sales, diminish the defendant\u2019s sales, or stop the defendant\u2019s allegedly unfair competition.\nBrocade relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, along with measures such as physical and operational security and contractual restrictions, to protect its intellectual property rights in its proprietary technologies, but none of these methods of protection may be entirely appropriate or adequate to address all risks that could result in a loss of intellectual property rights. Loss or violation of Brocade\u2019s intellectual property rights could adversely affect Brocade\u2019s business and operating results, through a loss of revenue or an increase in expenses.\nBrocade relies on licenses from third parties, and the loss or inability to obtain any such license could adversely affect its business.\nMany Brocade products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Brocade\u2019s inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on Brocade\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition, including its ability to continue to distribute or support affected products.\nIn addition, if Brocade has failed, or in the future fails to, adequately manage the use of commercial or \u201copen source\u201d software in Brocade\u2019s products, or if companies acquired by Brocade fail in such regard, Brocade may be subject to copyright infringement litigation or other claims. Furthermore, Brocade may be required, for commercially licensed software, to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement. In the case of open source software, Brocade may be required to license proprietary portions of its products on a royalty-free basis, disclose proprietary parts of source code, or commence costly product redesigns that could result in a loss of intellectual property rights, product performance degradation, or a delay in shipping products to customers and result in loss of revenue.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect Brocade\u2019s business operations.\nBrocade\u2019s business operations and the operations of its suppliers, CMs, and customers are vulnerable to interruptions caused by acts of terrorism, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, nuclear reactor leaks, hurricanes, power losses, telecommunications failures, and other events beyond Brocade\u2019s control. For example, a substantial portion of Brocade\u2019s facilities, including its corporate headquarters, are located near major earthquake faults. Brocade does not have multiple-site capacity for all of its services in the event of a business disruption. In the event of a major earthquake, Brocade could experience business interruption resulting from destruction of facilities or other infrastructure and from loss of life. Brocade carries a limited amount of earthquake insurance, which may not be sufficient to cover earthquake-related losses, and has not set aside funds or reserves to cover other potential earthquake-related losses. Additionally, major public health issues, such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic, may interrupt business operations of Brocade, its CMs, its customers, or its suppliers in those geographic regions affected by that particular health issue. In addition, one of Brocade\u2019s CMs has a major facility located in an area that is subject to hurricanes, and Brocade\u2019s suppliers could face other natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, extreme weather, and fires. In the event that a business interruption occurs that affects Brocade, its suppliers, CMs, or customers, shipments could be delayed and Brocade\u2019s business and financial results could be harmed.\nIn addition, Brocade may suffer reputational harm and may not carry sufficient insurance to compensate for financial losses that may occur as a result of any of these events. Any such event could have an adverse effect on Brocade\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition, and could expose Brocade to significant third-party claims of liability and damages.\nAny failure by Brocade to meet its current capital return objectives could have an adverse effect on its reputation and stock price.\nBrocade has publicly stated its intent to return at least 60% of its annual adjusted free cash flow to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Brocade\u2019s ability to return at least 60% of its adjusted free cash flow to stockholders is limited by, among other things, Delaware law. If Brocade is unable to meet its intended capital return objective, or if the Board of Directors decides to alter the capital return objective, Brocade\u2019s reputation and its stock price may be adversely affected.\nBrocade\u2019s business is subject to increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that could adversely affect its business, financial results, and stock price.\nBrocade is subject to the changing rules and regulations of federal and state governments as well as the stock exchange on which Brocade\u2019s common stock is listed. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., and the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), have issued a significant number of new regulations over the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements. Further, Brocade is subject to various rules and regulations of certain foreign jurisdictions. Brocade\u2019s efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities.\nFor example, The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires Brocade to furnish a report by Brocade\u2019s management on internal control over financial reporting. This report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified by management. If the assessment does not assert that internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if Brocade\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of Brocade\u2019s internal control over financial reporting), Brocade\u2019s stockholders could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of Brocade\u2019s financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on Brocade\u2019s stock price.\nAdditionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires that public companies disclose whether certain minerals, commonly known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by those companies, and, if so, if those minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of certain components that are incorporated in Brocade products. In addition, Brocade\u2019s supply chain is complex, so Brocade may face reputational challenges with its partners, customers, stockholders, and other stakeholders if the origins of the conflict minerals used in its products cannot be verified sufficiently.\nSimilarly, Brocade is subject to environmental and other regulations governing product safety, materials usage, packaging, and other environmental impacts in the countries where Brocade products are sold. For example, many Brocade products are subject to laws and regulations that restrict the use of certain substances such as lead, mercury, hexavalent chromium, and cadmium, and that require Brocade to assume responsibility for collecting, treating, recycling, and disposing of products when they have reached the end of their useful life. For example, in Europe, environmental restrictions apply to products sold in that region, and certain Brocade partners require compliance with these or other more stringent requirements. In addition, recycling, labeling, and related requirements apply to Brocade products sold in Europe and China. If Brocade products do not comply with local environmental laws, Brocade could be subject to fines, civil and criminal sanctions, and contract damage claims. In addition, Brocade could be prohibited from shipping noncompliant products into certain jurisdictions and required to recall and replace any noncompliant products already shipped, which would disrupt the ability to ship products and result in reduced revenue, increased warranty expense, increased obsolete or excess inventories, and harm to Brocade\u2019s business and customer relationships.\nIn addition, Brocade is subject to laws, rules, and regulations in the United States and other countries relating to the collection, use, and security of personal information and data. Brocade has incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards, protocols, and obligations imposed by applicable laws, regulations, industry standards, and contracts. In addition, such data privacy laws, regulations, and other obligations may negatively impact Brocade\u2019s ability to execute transactions and pursue business opportunities. The privacy and data protection-related laws, rules, and regulations applicable to Brocade are also subject to significant change. For example, in October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated a safe harbor framework that allowed Brocade and other U.S. companies to meet certain European legal requirements for transferring personal data from Europe to the United States. Brocade is in the process of evaluating and considering changes to its data handling practices as a result of this court decision. Any inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, or other obligations, could result in significant cost and liability, damage Brocade\u2019s reputation, and adversely affect its business.\nChanges to Brocade\u2019s provision for income taxes or unfavorable outcomes of tax audits could adversely impact Brocade\u2019s financial condition or results.\nBrocade is subject to income and other taxes in the United States, including those required by both state and federal governmental agencies such as the IRS, and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Brocade\u2019s provision for income taxes could be increased due to changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which Brocade does business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense. In this regard, the United States, countries in the European Union, and other countries where Brocade operates are actively considering changes to relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. In addition, future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by changes in the geographic mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, lapses in the federal R&D tax credit, and tax effects of stock-based compensation. These potential changes could increase Brocade\u2019s effective tax rate or result in other costs in the future.\nBrocade is subject to periodic audits or other reviews by such governmental agencies, and is currently under examination by the IRS and several state and foreign tax jurisdictions for various years. Audits by the IRS and other governmental tax agencies are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes, including potential fines or penalties. While Brocade regularly assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of its tax provision, the occurrence of an unfavorable outcome in any specific period could have an adverse effect on Brocade\u2019s financial condition or results for that period or future periods. The expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant.\nBrocade is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims that could adversely affect its financial condition or results.\nBrocade is a party to lawsuits in the normal course of its business. Litigation in general can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Responding to lawsuits brought against Brocade, or legal actions initiated by Brocade, can often be expensive and time-consuming. Unfavorable outcomes from these claims and/or lawsuits could adversely affect Brocade\u2019s business, financial results, or financial condition, and Brocade could incur substantial monetary liability and/or be required to change its business practices. In view of the uncertainties, potential risks, and expenses of litigation, Brocade may, from time to time, settle such disputes, even where Brocade had meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements that, depending on their terms, may significantly impact Brocade\u2019s financial condition or results.\nBrocade\u2019s stock price may fluctuate, which could cause the value of an investment in Brocade\u2019s shares to decline.\nBrocade\u2019s stock price has fluctuated in the past and may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to various factors. Brocade does not have the ability to influence or control many of these factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that could affect Brocade\u2019s stock price include, among others:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated changes in Brocade\u2019s operating results;\n\u2022\nWhether Brocade\u2019s operating results meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated changes in the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in their earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nThe announcement or timing of Brocade\u2019s quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of actual or anticipated operating results by Brocade\u2019s competitors, Brocade\u2019s OEM partners, and other companies in the IT industry;\n\u2022\nSpeculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about, or actual changes in, Brocade\u2019s business, strategic position, competitive position, market share, operations, prospects, future stock price performance, or Brocade\u2019s industry in general;\n\u2022\nThe announcement of new, planned, or contemplated products; services; commercial relationships; technological innovations; acquisitions; divestitures; or other significant transactions by Brocade or its competitors;\n\u2022\nAdverse changes to Brocade\u2019s relationships with any of its OEM partners;\n\u2022\nChanges in the business strategy or execution of any of Brocade\u2019s OEM partners;\n\u2022\nDepartures of key employees;\n\u2022\nLitigation or disputes involving Brocade, Brocade\u2019s industry, or both;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nSales of Brocade\u2019s shares by Brocade\u2019s officers, directors, or significant stockholders; and\n\u2022\nThe timing and amount of dividends and share repurchases.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Accordingly, broad market and industry factors may adversely affect Brocade\u2019s stock price regardless of Brocade\u2019s operating performance. In addition, Brocade\u2019s stock price might also fluctuate in reaction to events that affect other companies in Brocade\u2019s industry even if these events do not directly affect Brocade.\nIf Brocade\u2019s stock price fluctuates widely, Brocade may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert Brocade\u2019s management\u2019s attention and resources from Brocade\u2019s business.\nBrocade has incurred substantial indebtedness that may decrease its business flexibility, access to capital, and/or increase its borrowing costs, which may adversely affect Brocade\u2019s operations and financial results.\nAs of October 31, 2015, Brocade had approximately $875 million in principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, including $575 million of indebtedness under the 1.375% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the \u201c2020 Convertible Notes\u201d) and $300 million of unsecured indebtedness under the 4.625% senior notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d) (see Note 8, \u201cBorrowings,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). The indenture governing the 2023 Notes contains several negative covenants that restrict the incurrence of debt by Brocade\u2019s subsidiaries, restrict the incurrence of liens on principal properties, and restrict Brocade and its subsidiaries from engaging in certain sale-leaseback transactions. In addition, the indentures governing both the 2020 Convertible Notes and the 2023 Notes impose covenants that restrict Brocade\u2019s ability to effect certain mergers, consolidations, or sales of assets and require Brocade to offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of certain \u201cfundamental changes\u201d or \u201cchanges of control triggering events.\u201d These covenants could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Brocade\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs, should further debt financing be desired, and may adversely affect Brocade\u2019s operations and financial results. Brocade\u2019s failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the applicable indenture, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt or demand payment in exchange for a waiver of such default. A default under one of the indentures could also result in cross-defaults under Brocade\u2019s other debt instruments, negatively impact the price and liquidity of Brocade\u2019s debt and equity securities, negatively impact Brocade\u2019s credit ratings, and impair Brocade\u2019s ability to access sources of capital. If any of Brocade\u2019s debt is accelerated, Brocade may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt.\nAgencies rating Brocade\u2019s debt securities may lower Brocade\u2019s credit rating. This could further negatively impact the price and liquidity of Brocade\u2019s debt and equity securities. If Brocade\u2019s credit rating is lowered, it could also negatively impact Brocade\u2019s ability to access sources of capital.\nAlthough interest rates have remained at low levels in recent years, they may increase for various reasons, including an increase in inflation, Federal Reserve Board actions, domestic or international fiscal policies, or domestic or international events impacting financial or capital markets. Higher interest rates or increase in credit spread for Brocade\u2019s rating could negatively impact Brocade\u2019s ability to raise additional debt or refinance existing debt.\nThe occurrence of a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d with respect to the 2020 Convertible Notes or a \u201cChange of Control Triggering Event\u201d with respect to the 2023 Notes or a conversion of the 2020 Convertible Notes could negatively impact Brocade\u2019s cash flows and financial position.\nHolders of the 2020 Convertible Notes have the right to require Brocade to repurchase their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d and holders of the 2023 Notes have the right to require Brocade to repurchase their senior notes upon the occurrence of a \u201cChange of Control Triggering Event,\u201d in each case at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the 2020 Convertible Notes, Brocade will be required to make cash payments up to the full conversion value in respect of the convertible notes being converted, unless Brocade elects to only deliver shares of its common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share). It is Brocade\u2019s current intent and policy to settle conversions of the 2020 Convertible Notes through the delivery of cash up to the principal amount of converted convertible notes, together with shares of common stock to satisfy any conversion obligation in excess of such specified dollar amount. However, if Brocade elects to settle conversions of the 2020 Convertible Notes solely in shares of common stock, such settlement would result in additional dilution to Brocade\u2019s stockholders and could result in more dilutive accounting treatment for the 2020 Convertible Notes. The 2020 Convertible Notes may be converted at the option of the holders during certain periods as a result of, among other things, fluctuations in Brocade\u2019s stock price.\nIf Brocade is required to make repurchases of the 2020 Convertible Notes or the 2023 Notes or make cash payments in respect of conversions of the 2020 Convertible Notes, Brocade may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms (or at all) at the time. Further, these obligations would negatively impact Brocade\u2019s cash flows and could limit its ability to use its available cash and cash flow for other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, and other general corporate purposes. Brocade\u2019s ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the 2020 Convertible Notes may also be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing its future indebtedness.\nProvisions in Brocade\u2019s charter documents, customer agreements, and Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of Brocade, which could hinder stockholders\u2019 ability to receive a premium for Brocade\u2019s common stock and adversely affect the value of Brocade\u2019s convertible notes.\nProvisions of Brocade\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or mergers that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nAuthorizing the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nProhibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nLimitations on who may call special meetings of stockholders and when special meetings of stockholders may be called; and\n\u2022\nProhibiting stockholder actions by written consent.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law also may discourage, delay, or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with Brocade, and Brocade\u2019s agreements with certain Brocade customers require that Brocade give prior notice of a change of control and grant certain manufacturing rights following a change of control. Brocade\u2019s various change of control provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of Brocade, which could hinder stockholders\u2019 ability to receive a premium for Brocade\u2019s common stock and could adversely affect the value of Brocade\u2019s convertible notes.", "PERMNO": 86881, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "BRCD"}
