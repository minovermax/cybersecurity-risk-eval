{"cik": "1682325", "company": "GTY Technology Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industries\nThe ongoing integration of the business, management and operations of Bonfire, CityBase, eCivis, Open Counter, Questica and Sherpa may prove difficult, disrupt our business and operations, divert management attention and adversely affect the business and financial results of our consolidated company.\nWe completed the business combination in February 2019, which we believe will result in certain benefits and synergies, including our goal of establishing an efficiently integrated public sector SaaS company through our six operating subsidiaries which, together, we believe can offer solutions to North American state and local governments that may not otherwise be achievable by any one individual business on its own. However, our ability to realize these anticipated benefits depends on the successful integration of the six businesses. The consolidated company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe inability to integrate the businesses in a timely and cost-efficient manner or do so without adversely impacting revenue, operations and cash flows;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of our management team to successfully manage the consolidated business and operations;\n\u00b7\nexpected synergies or operating efficiencies may fail to materialize in whole or part, or may not occur within expected time-frames;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to successfully manage relationships with each company\u2019s customers and their operating results and businesses generally (including the diversion of management time to react to new and unforeseen issues);\n\u00b7\nthe failure or inability to timely and efficiently integrate and establish new sales forces without materially adversely impacting our relationships with customers;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to accurately estimate the potential markets and market shares for the consolidated business\u2019s products, the nature and extent of competitive responses to the business combination and the ability of the consolidated to achieve or exceed projected market growth rates;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to attract key personnel or to retain key personnel with unique talents, expertise or background knowledge as a consequence of both voluntary and involuntary employment actions;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to successfully advocate the benefits of the consolidated for existing and potential customers or general uncertainty regarding the value proposition of the combined entity or its products;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties forecasting financial results;\n\u00b7\nfailures in our financial reporting, including those resulting from system implementations in the context of the integration, our ability to report or forecast financial results of the consolidated and our inability to successfully discover and assess and integrate into our reporting system, any of which may adversely impact our ability to make timely and accurate filings with the SEC and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies; and\n\u00b7\nthe potential that we are not yet fully aware of the risks and potential liabilities of any of Bonfire, CityBase, eCivis, Open Counter, Questica or Sherpa.\nThe ongoing integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses or delays, distract management from other revenue or acquisition opportunities, and increase the consolidated business\u2019s expenses and working capital requirements, particularly in the short-term. If we are unable to successfully complete the integration of our businesses and operations in a timely manner, the anticipated benefits of the business combination may not be fully realized, or at all, or may take longer to realize than anticipated. Should any of the foregoing or other currently unanticipated risks arise, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted.\nOur goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment that could negatively impact our earnings.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. As of December 31, 2019, we had $402.4 million of goodwill and net intangible assets, comprising approximately 93% of our total assets. If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in our goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nDuring the 2019 Successor Period, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $32.2 million related to the Acquisition. The fair value of the goodwill related to the Acquisition continues to be sensitive to changes in projections for revenue growth rates and earnings. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value to fall below its carrying amount and/or the value of long-lived assets to not be recoverable, which could lead to the measurement and recognition of goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment. These risks include, but are not limited to, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, lowered expectations of future financial results, failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, adverse changes in the business climate, and the loss of key personnel. If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nCertain liabilities resulting from acquisitions are estimated and could lead to a material impact on earnings.\nThrough our acquisition activities, we record liabilities for future contingent earnout payments that are settled in cash or through the issuance of common stock. The fair value of these liabilities is assessed on a quarterly basis and changes in assumptions used to determine the amount of the liability or a change in the fair value of our common stock could lead to an adjustment that may have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on our results of operations. For additional information regarding our contingent earnout liabilities, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations\u201d and Note 3 of our Financial Statements.\nWithout obtaining adequate capital funding or improving our financial performance, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nAs described in their audit report, our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph that states we have incurred ongoing losses and that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are attempting to further expand our customer base; scale up our production of various products and increase revenues; however, our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations through the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering and our ability to further generate sufficient revenues. While we believe in the viability of our platform and in our ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering, debt financing or strategic alternative, there can be no assurances to that effect. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in us.\nOur failure to generate sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our debt would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn February 14, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured term loan credit facility that provides for borrowing of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $12.0 million. The credit facility has a maturity date of twelve months from the borrowing date of the term loans. On the closing date, the Company fully drew on the credit facility, net of deferred issuance costs of $0.4 million. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance the term loan credit facility and any additional debt obligations we may incur depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that may be beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or if our results of operations cause us to fail to comply with our financial covenants, we may be required to take one or more actions, including refinancing our debt, significantly reducing expenses, renegotiating our debt covenants, restructuring our debt, selling assets or obtaining additional capital, each of which may be on terms that may be onerous, highly dilutive or disruptive to our business. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on commercially reasonable or acceptable terms, which could result in a default on our obligations, including under the term loan credit facility.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the \u201cJOBS Act.\u201d As such, we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. We had revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately $36.4 million. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following November 1, 2021, the fifth anniversary of the GTY Cayman IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for securities and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are a smaller reporting company (and may remain a smaller reporting company even after losing emerging growth company status), and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced or scaled reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to smaller companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, and, for as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company (which may be longer than we remain an emerging growth company), we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nnot being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u00b7\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u00b7\nproviding only two years of audited financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\nOur restated articles of organization designate the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders and the United States District Court in Boston as the sole and exclusive forum for any claim arising under the Securities Act, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur restated articles of organization designate the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts as the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any\naction asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our shareholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, our articles of organization or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Our restated articles of organization designate the United States District Court in Boston as the sole and exclusive forum for any claim arising under the Securities Act or any claim for which other courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction including, without limitation, any claim arising under the Exchange Act. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, the United States District Court in Boston or a court outside of Massachusetts were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other venues or jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nSoftware- & Technology-Related/Internet-Focused Risk Factors\nCyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position.\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individuals and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may take steps that pose threats to our clients\u2019 IT. They may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of our data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats.\nDisclosure of personally identifiable information and/or other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nWe store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable and other confidential information of our clients. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve security controls, it is possible that our security controls over personal data, our training of employees on data security, and other practices that we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of client data that we store and manage. Disclosure of personally identifiable information and/or other sensitive client data could result in material liability and harm our reputation.\nData privacy is an evolving area of the law and our business may become subject to new and expanding regulations. Application of these new and changing laws to our business may increase risks and compliance costs.\nHosting services for some of our products and services are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers.\nA material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services. These hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster, fire, power loss, telecommunications or Internet failure, acts of terrorism, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses, and other similar damaging events. If any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period, we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments. Although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences, we can give no assurance that damaging\nevents such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services, which could result in client dissatisfaction, loss of revenue, and damage to our business.\nWe run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products.\nOur software products and services are complex and may contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found in the future. Any such defects could result in a loss of revenues, negative publicity or delay market acceptance. Our license and subscription agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability. However, it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or judicial decisions. We cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\nWe must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive.\nThe market for our products is characterized by technological change, evolving industry standards in software technology, changes in client requirements, and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements, and achieve market acceptance. We cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product and service opportunities and develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. The products, capabilities, or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our business may be adversely affected if they are unable to develop or acquire new software products or services or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such new products or services or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance.\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary rights.\nMany of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of contracts, copyrights, and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property. There has also been significant litigation recently involving intellectual property rights. We may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that third-parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against one or more of the products or services with respect to current or future products or services. Any claims or litigation, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, costly, and a diversion to management. Any such claims and litigation could also cause product delivery delays, service interruptions or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Therefore, litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.\nClients may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally.\nIt is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software, trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights (excluding software applications provided on a hosted or cloud basis). This could adversely affect our revenues and profits. Additionally, they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third-parties, including our competitors, which could adversely affect our business.\nMaterial portions of our business require the Internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained.\nPart of our future success depends on the use of the Internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically. This in part requires the further development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. Among other things, this further development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, security, and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable Internet access and services. If this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained, our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals.\nSecurity breaches or unauthorized access to payment information, including credit/debit card data, and/or personal information that we, or our service providers, store, process, use or transmit for our business may harm our reputation, cause service disruptions and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA significant challenge to electronic commerce is the secure transmission of payment information and/or personal information over information technology networks and systems which process, transmit and store electronic information, and manage or support a variety of business processes. The collection, maintenance, use, disclosure, and disposal of payment information and personal information by our business is regulated at state and federal levels, and cybersecurity legislation, executive orders and reporting requirements continue to evolve and become more complex. Because we either directly or indirectly through service providers (i) provide the electronic transmission of sensitive and personal information released from and filed with various government entities and (ii) perform online payment and electronic check processing services, we face the risk of a security breach, whether through system attacks, hacking events, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, viruses, human errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events that could lead to significant disruptions or compromises of information technology networks and systems or the unauthorized release or use of payment information or personal information. Additionally, vulnerabilities in the security of our own internal systems or those of our service providers could compromise the confidentiality of, or result in unauthorized access to, personal information of our employees.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology purchased or licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication tools to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including user credit/debit card information and banking data. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, threats that evolve ahead of tools designed to counter them, or other developments may result in the breach or compromise of technology used by them to protect transaction data. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, such as so-called \u201csocial engineering,\u201d where individuals are manipulated into divulging confidential or personal information.\nDespite the various security measures that we have in place to protect payment and personal information from unauthorized disclosure and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our information technology networks and systems and those of our third-party vendors and service providers cannot be made completely secure against security incidents. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain vulnerable to security breaches or disruptions, because (i) the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected for an extended period and (ii) the security methodologies, protocols, systems and procedures used for protection are implemented by humans at each level, and human errors may occur. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even if appropriate training is conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures, or those of our service providers, could misappropriate information, including, but not limited to payment information and personal information, or cause interruptions or direct damage to our partners or our users.\nUnder payment card rules and our contracts with our credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, process, or transmit, we could be subject to fines. We could also be liable to partners for costs of investigation, notification, remediation and credit monitoring and for any damages to users under applicable laws or our partner contracts.\nIn addition, any noncompliance with privacy laws or a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized access, use or disclosure of payment information or personal information, or other significant disruption involving our information technology networks and systems, or those of our service providers (whether or not caused by a breach of our contractual obligations or our negligence), may lead to negative publicity, impair our ability to conduct our business, subject us to private litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages or remediation costs. It may also cause the governments with whom we contract to lose confidence in us, any of which may cause the termination or modification of our government contracts and impair our ability to win future contracts. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks affecting us, our service providers\u2019 or our government partners\u2019 environment may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third-party security experts and consultants. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover or protect against the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system disruption. If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may also suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to integrate new technologies and industry standards effectively, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, and features of our services in accordance with industry standards and to address the increasingly sophisticated technological needs of our customers on a cost-effective and timely basis. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nEnhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, and other features of the government services we offer;\n\u00b7\nContinue to develop our technical expertise;\n\u00b7\nDevelop and introduce new services, applications, and technology to meet changing customer needs and preferences; and\n\u00b7\nInfluence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWe cannot ensure that we will be successful in responding to the above technological and industry challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we are unable to integrate new technologies and industry standards effectively, our business could be harmed.\nPublic Sector-Related Risk Factors\nSelling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state, county, and city governments, utilities, tribal governments, other municipal agencies, and other public entities. We expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future. We face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities, including:\n\u00b7\nResource limitations caused by budgetary constraints, which may provide for a termination of executed contracts due to a lack of future funding;\n\u00b7\nLong and complex sales cycles;\n\u00b7\nContract payments at times being subject to achieving implementation milestones, and we may have differences with clients as to whether milestones have been achieved;\n\u00b7\nPolitical resistance to the concept of contracting with third-parties to provide IT solutions;\n\u00b7\nLegislative changes affecting a local government\u2019s authority to contract with third-parties;\n\u00b7\nVarying bid procedures and internal processes for bid acceptance; and\n\u00b7\nVarious other political factors, including changes in governmental administrations and personnel.\nEach of these risks is outside our control. If we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nA prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services. Local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future. There is no assurance that local and state spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions, and if budget shortfalls occur, they may negatively impact local and state IT spending and could adversely affect our business.\nThe open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards.\nMany governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process. Generally, a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements. To respond successfully to these requests for proposals, we must accurately estimate their cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations for the proposed client, and the likely terms of any other third-party proposals submitted. We cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process, or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms. Our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process, or to secure such contracts on favorable terms, may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins.\nWe face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets.\nWe face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us, as well as from companies offering to develop custom software. We compete based on a number of factors, including\n\u00b7\nThe breadth, depth, and quality of our product and service offerings;\n\u00b7\nThe ability to modify our offerings to accommodate particular clients\u2019 needs;\n\u00b7\nTechnological innovation; and\n\u00b7\nName recognition, reputation and references.\nWe believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size, product platform, and product scope. Our competitors include consulting firms, publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market, and a significant number of smaller, privately held companies. Certain competitors have greater technical, marketing, and financial resources than we do. We cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance.\nWe also compete with internal, centralized IT departments of governmental entities, which requires us to persuade the end-user to stop the internal service and outsource to us. In addition, our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments, which could reduce the market for our services.\nWe could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced. Increased competition could result in pricing pressure, fewer client orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third-parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients. It is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nIf we are unable to meet the unique challenges involved in contracting with governments and government agencies, our business may be harmed.\nOur revenues are generated principally from contracts with state and local governments and government agencies, to provide digital government services on behalf of those government entities to complete transactions and distribute public information digitally. We face many risks uniquely associated with government contracting, including:\n\u00b7\nRegulations that govern the fees they collect for many of our services, limiting their control over the level of transaction-based fees they are permitted to retain;\n\u00b7\nThe potential need for governments to draft and adopt specific legislation before they can circulate a request for proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) to which we can respond or before they can otherwise award a contract or provide a new digital service;\n\u00b7\nUnexpected changes in legislation that increase our costs or result in a temporary or permanent suspension of our services;\n\u00b7\nChanges to legislation authorizing government\u2019s contracting with third parties to receive or distribute public information;\n\u00b7\nLong and complex sales cycles that vary significantly according to each government entity\u2019s policies and procedures;\n\u00b7\nPolitical resistance to the concept of government agencies contracting with third parties to receive or distribute public information, which has been offered traditionally only by the government agencies and often without charge;\n\u00b7\nChanges in government administrations that could impact existing RFPs, rebids, renewals or extensions; and\n\u00b7\nGovernment budget deficits and appropriation approval processes and periods, either of which could cause governments to curtail spending on services, including time and materials-based fees for application development or fixed fees for portal management.\nOur ability to grow revenues may be limited by the number of governments and government agencies that choose to provide digital government solutions such as those offered by us.\nOur revenues are generated principally from contracts with state and local governments and government agencies to provide digital government solutions on behalf of those government entities to complete transactions and distribute public information digitally. The growth in our revenues largely will depend on government entities adopting solutions such as those offered by us. We cannot ensure that government entities will choose to provide digital government services or continue to provide digital government services at current levels, or that they will provide such services with private assistance or by adopting solutions such as those offered by us. The failure to secure contracts with certain government agencies could result in revenue levels insufficient to support our operations on a self-sustained, profitable basis.\nWe are subject to independent audits as requested by our government customers. Deficiencies in our performance under a government contract could result in contract termination, reputational damage, or financial penalties.\nEach government entity with which we contract for outsourced portal services may have the authority to require an independent audit of our performance and financial management of contracted operations. The scope of audits could include inspections of income statements, balance sheets, fee structures, collections practices, service levels, security practices, and our compliance with contract provisions and applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The expansion of our operations into new markets and services may further expose us to requirements and potential liabilities under additional statutes and rules that have previously not been relevant to our business. We cannot ensure that a future audit will not find any material performance deficiencies that would result in an adjustment to our revenues and result in financial penalties. Moreover, any consequent negative publicity could harm our reputation among other governments with which we would like to contract. These factors could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Public Companies, Generally\nFluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price.\nOur revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nProspective clients\u2019 contracting decisions are often made in the last few weeks of a quarter;\n\u00b7\nThe size of license transactions can vary significantly;\n\u00b7\nClients may unexpectedly postpone or cancel procurement processes due to changes in strategic priorities, project objectives, budget, or personnel;\n\u00b7\nClient purchasing processes vary significantly and a client\u2019s internal approval, expenditure authorization, and contract negotiation processes can be difficult and time consuming to complete, even after selection of a vendor;\n\u00b7\nThe number, timing, and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and our competitors may affect purchase decisions;\n\u00b7\nWe may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition policies; and\n\u00b7\nClients may elect subscription-based arrangements, which result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional, on-premise software license arrangements, but generate higher overall subscription-based revenues over the term of the contract.\nIn each fiscal quarter, our expense levels, operating costs, and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed. If our actual revenues fall below expectations, we could experience a reduction in operating results. Also, if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations, it may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nIncreases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins.\nWe realize lower margins on service revenues than on software subscription or license revenue. The majority of our contracts include both software and professional services. Therefore, an increase in the percentage of professional service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile. Examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include:\n\u00b7\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements of technological innovations, new products, or new contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nDevelopments with respect to patents, copyrights, or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nConditions and trends in the software and other technology industries;\n\u00b7\nAdoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry;\n\u00b7\nChanges in financial estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u00b7\nGeneral market conditions and other factors.\nIn addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock. Sometimes, securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities. We cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. A significant number of our shares became free of resale restrictions on February 19, 2020, which was the date one year from the business combination. The presence of these additional shares of common stock trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nExercise of warrants for common stock would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had warrants to purchase 27,093,334 shares of common stock outstanding. Each whole warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at $11.50 per share. While our warrants are currently substantially \u201cunderwater,\u201d to the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then-existing holders of common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur financial outlook may not be realized.\nFrom time to time, in press releases and otherwise, we may publish forecasts or other forward-looking statements regarding our results, including estimated revenues or earnings. Any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions. These assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties, and as a matter of course, any number of them may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors (including those described in this discussion), many of which are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse. Current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions, but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forward-looking information, as well as other available information regarding us, our products and services, and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and other regulatory requirements or industry standards may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and other regulatory requirements or industry standards, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, new SEC regulations and the Nasdaq Stock Market rules create uncertainty for public companies such as ours. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining adequate and appropriate standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards have resulted in, and certain regulations could continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Further, because of increasing regulation, our board members and executive officers could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities in the laws themselves or related to practice, our reputation may be harmed.\nOur quarterly results of operations may be volatile and difficult to predict. If our quarterly results of operations, future growth, profitability or dividends fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly.\nOur future revenues and results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and any of which may harm our business. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe commencement, completion, or termination of contracts during any quarter;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\ntechnical difficulties or system downtime affecting the operation of our services;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business operations and infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in federal, state and local legislation that increase our costs and/or result in a temporary or permanent decrease in our revenues;\n\u00b7\nany federal government shutdown, such as the shutdown which commenced in December 2018, each of which impacts the ability of our customers to purchase our products and services;\n\u00b7\nthe seasonal use of some of our services, particularly the payment of real estate taxes;\n\u00b7\nchanges in economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe result of negative cash flows due to capital investments; and\n\u00b7\nsignificant charges related to acquisitions.\nDue to the factors noted above and the other factors described in these Risk Factors, our financial performance in a quarter may be lower than we anticipate and if we are unable to reduce spending in that quarter, our results of operations for that quarter may be harmed. One should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock may decline. In addition, if we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends or other market expectations, the price of our common stock may decline.\nEach operating subsidiary\u2019s management and independent registered public accounting firm have previously identified internal control deficiencies, which such management and independent registered public accounting firms believe constitute material weaknesses. If we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to timely and accurately report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nEach of our operating subsidiaries was previously a private company not subject to the rules of the SEC implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, therefore, was not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. We are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\nAlthough our operating subsidiaries have not made assessments of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting and did not engage their independent registered public accounting firms to conduct audits of their internal control over financial reporting, in connection with the audits of the their financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, each operating subsidiary\u2019s management and independent registered public accounting firm identified one or more material weaknesses relating to such subsidiary\u2019s internal control over financial reporting under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. The PCAOB defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of a company\u2019s financial reporting.\nThe material weaknesses identified by the operating subsidiaries and their independent registered public accounting firms included: (i) deficiencies in Bonfire\u2019s period end financial statement close process, (ii) each of CityBase\u2019s, eCivis\u2019s, Open Counter\u2019s and Sherpa\u2019s limited segregation of duties with regard to financial reporting activities such as payroll entry and processing due to the size of their respective accounting departments and (iii) deficiencies in Questica\u2019s period end financial statement close process resulting from, among other things, the preparation of its financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K which have a different fiscal year end than its historical fiscal year end.\nWe believe that, as of December 31, 2019, we have remediated these material weaknesses and improved the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting by implementing additional controls related thereto.\nThe remediation efforts management took to address the previously identified material weaknesses include, but are not limited to, the following:\nImplementation of specific policies and procedures with detailed instructions to the operating subsidiaries in order to adequately communicate the requirements around processes and controls;\nImplementation of controls over manual journal entries and account reconciliations, including improving controls and procedures related to the timeliness and effectiveness of our review and approval procedures;\nExpansion of our financial leadership team by adding employees and external consultants, each with the commensurate knowledge, experience, and training to properly support our financial reporting and accounting functions including overseeing that the first two items listed are timely and adequately implemented; and\nAdoption of formal accounting policies related to non-routine complex transactions, such accounting for business combinations, revenue recognition, equity classification, deferred income taxes and derivative accounting.\nThere is no assurance that any measures we may take in the future will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses described above or to avoid potential future material weaknesses. If management fails to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements and meet our SEC reporting obligations, which could result in sanctions by Nasdaq or the SEC. This could result in a loss of investor confidence and could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nThe impact of the coronavirus outbreak, or similar global health concerns, could negatively impact our operations, supply chain and customer base.\nOur operations for certain of our products or services could be negatively impacted by the regional or global outbreak of illnesses, including coronavirus (COVID-19). Any quarantines, labor shortages or other disruptions to our operations, or those of our customers, may adversely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, including those in which we operate, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services. We are unable to accurately predict the possible future effect on the Company if coronavirus or another disease expands globally.", "PERMNO": 16464, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "GTYH"}
