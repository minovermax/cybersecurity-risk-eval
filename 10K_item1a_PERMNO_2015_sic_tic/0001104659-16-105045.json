RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a summary description of some of the material risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, including our future financial and operational results. In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following statements should be carefully considered in evaluating us.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nBecause our business model is continuing to develop, our past operating results may not be indicative of future performance, and our future operating results may fluctuate materially and may increase your investment risk.\nWe were formed in November 2005 and have a limited operating history. For fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, our total revenue was $173.8 million, $159.5 million and $131.8 million, respectively. Although we have experienced significant growth in revenue generation in recent periods, our relatively short operating history and developing business model make it difficult to assess our future prospects. The success of our business faces a number of challenges, including:\n\u00b7 continuing to innovate and improve the technologies that enable us to provide our solutions;\n\u00b7 maintaining and expanding our existing relationships, and developing new relationships with buyers and sellers;\n\u00b7 increasing the level of spending through our buyer and seller platforms;\n\u00b7 developing market acceptance for our programmatic solutions, including the Tremor Video DSP and the Tremor Video SSP;\n\u00b7 the growth, evolution and rate of adoption of industry standards;\n\u00b7 offering competitive pricing to buyers;\n\u00b7 offering competitive rates to sellers;\n\u00b7 delivering online video advertising campaign performance results that are superior to competing providers or technologies;\n\u00b7 competing effectively against traditional and online media companies to increase our share of brand advertising spend;\n\u00b7 ensuring that our clients\u2019 video ads are shown in brand-safe environments;\n\u00b7 maintaining and increasing the value of our brand and goodwill with buyers and sellers;\n\u00b7 effectively controlling our costs as we grow our business;\n\u00b7 responding to evolving government regulations relating to the internet, telecommunications, privacy, marketing and advertising aspects of our business; and\n\u00b7 identifying, attracting, retaining and motivating qualified personnel.\nOur ability to meet these challenges will help determine whether we can successfully leverage our business model to achieve profitability and growth in the future. We cannot assure our ability to achieve this goal, to generate consistent and improving operating results, or even to maintain the same level of success that we have had to date. If we fail to meet these challenges, our operating results may fluctuate materially and may increase your investment risk.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since inception, and we expect our operating expenses to increase in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred operating losses since we were formed and expect to incur operating losses in the future. We incurred net losses of $43.2 million, $23.5 million, and $13.5 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $177.7 million and $134.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which included a $20.9 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2015 and a $15.8 million deemed dividend related to the conversion of our Series F preferred stock in fiscal 2013 in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, or IPO. We do not know if we will be able to achieve profitability or maintain profitability on a continued basis. Although our revenue has increased substantially in recent periods, we may not be able to maintain this rate of revenue growth. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we scale our business and expand our operations. In particular, we plan to continue to invest in our technology and development efforts and sales and marketing efforts. Our ability to achieve or sustain profitability is based on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may never be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nUnfavorable conditions in the global economy or the vertical markets we serve could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.\nGeneral worldwide economic conditions have experienced significant instability in recent years. These conditions make it extremely difficult for advertisers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could cause buyers to reduce or delay their advertising spending. Historically, economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in advertising spending. If macroeconomic conditions deteriorate, buyers may curtail or freeze spending on advertising in general and for solutions such as ours specifically, which would impact the amount of spend transacted through both our buyer and seller platforms. Furthermore, our contracts and relationships with advertising agencies on behalf of advertisers generally do not include long-term obligations requiring them to purchase our solutions and are cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty. Any reduction in advertising spending could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. In addition, our business may be materially and adversely affected by weak economic conditions in the specific vertical markets that we serve.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery. In addition, even if the overall economy improves, we cannot assure you that the market for online video advertising solutions will experience growth or that we will experience growth.\nIf we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology and client needs, our solutions may become less competitive or obsolete.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate. To attract new buyers, sellers and increase spend transacted through our platforms, we will need to expand and enhance our solutions to meet client needs, add functionality and address technological advancements. If we fail to develop new solutions that address the client\u2019s needs, or enhance and improve our solutions in a timely manner or conform to industry standards, we may not be able to achieve or maintain adequate market acceptance of our solutions, and our solutions may become less competitive or obsolete.\nOur ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver video advertising solutions at lower prices or more efficiently or effectively than our solutions, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete. For example, the online video advertising industry is shifting, in part, towards programmatic buying solutions. Programmatic buying is the automated purchase of digital advertising inventory through technology, including real time bidding technology, which allows for the dynamic purchase and sale of advertising inventory on an impression-by-impression basis. If our programmatic solutions are not considered effective, or if there is a delay or failure of the market to adopt our solutions, our business and growth prospects could be harmed as buyers may increasingly rely on programmatic channels to transact online video advertising spend. Moreover, even if our programmatic solutions experience significant adoption, such adoption may occur at the expense of our traditional non-programmatic managed service model.\nThe market in which we participate is intensely competitive and fragmented, and we may not be able to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.\nThe online video advertising market is highly competitive. We compete with large online video publishers such as Google Inc., Facebook, Inc., AOL Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. that offer video advertising services as part of a larger solution for digital media buying, as well as advertising technology companies, advertising networks, demand side platforms, supply side platforms and exchanges. In the traditional media space, our primary competitors are mainly TV networks, radio broadcasters and print media publishers, many of which also have a digital presence.\nMany of these competitors and potential competitors have significant client relationships, much larger financial resources and longer operating histories than we have and may be less severely affected by changes in consumer preferences, regulations or other developments that may impact the online video advertising industry as a whole. They, or other companies that offer competing advertising solutions, may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with buyers or sellers, thereby limiting our ability to promote our solutions and generate revenue. Competitive pressures could require us to reduce the prices we charge buyers or increase the prices we pay to sellers. For example, the online video advertising industry may experience price erosion due to increased adoption of automated ad buying.\nOur business may suffer to the extent that buyers and sellers purchase and sell online video advertising directly from each other or through other companies that are able to become intermediaries between buyers and sellers. New technologies and methods of buying advertising present a dynamic competitive challenge, as market participants offer multiple new products and services aimed at capturing advertising spend such as analytics, programmatic buying and bundled offline and online video advertising. If the market shifts towards such new technologies and we are unable to either provide such solutions in a compelling manner or otherwise compete with such shift in ad spending, we may incur increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share. If there is a failure to adopt our programmatic solutions our business and growth prospects could be harmed.\nFor our buyer platform, we believe that we compete for advertising spend primarily on the basis of proven technology and optimization capabilities, pricing, quality and scale of online video inventory, depth and breadth of relationships with buyers and sellers, all-screen capabilities, brand-centric measurement, ability to ensure brand safety and transparency into ad performance and placement. For our seller platform, we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of the speed and ease of use of our platform, the quality of tools that we provide to sellers to control their inventory and maximize yield, our ability to provide demand to sellers at scale and our ability to provide real-time reporting and analytics.\nOur competitors or potential competitors may adopt certain aspects of our business model, which could reduce our ability to differentiate our solutions. As market dynamics change, or as new and existing competitors introduce more competitive pricing or\nnew or disruptive technologies, we may be unable to maintain or attract new buyers or sellers or increase spend transacted through our platforms. As a result, we may be required to change our business model and incur additional expenses in response to competitive pressures, which could harm our revenue, profitability and operating results. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nWe operate in a new and rapidly evolving industry. If the online video advertising industry does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our operating results and growth prospects could be harmed.\nOnline video advertising is an emerging industry, and future demand and market acceptance for online video advertising is uncertain. Many buyers have limited experience with online brand advertising, generally, and online video advertising specifically, and may continue to devote more significant portions of their advertising budgets to traditional, offline-based advertising, such as television and print, and may not shift or devote significant portions of their advertising budgets to online video advertising. Additionally, we compete for online advertising spend with other products and technologies such as search, display and in-banner video as well as advertising networks and exchanges.\nWe believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online video ad spending by buyers generally will depend on the perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of our solutions, which are still emerging and evolving, and the continued growth in commercial use of online media, as well as other factors. Additionally, buyers may find online video advertising to be less effective than traditional offline channels, such as television, newspapers, radio and billboards, or other online methods for promoting their products and services, and they may reduce their spending on online video advertising from current levels as a result. Accordingly, if the market for online video advertising deteriorates, or develops more slowly than we expect, our operating results and growth prospects could be harmed.\nIf the market for our programmatic solutions develops more slowly than we expect then our operating results and growth prospects may be adversely affected.\nIn 2014, we introduced to market the Tremor Video DSP, a programmatic solution, which enables advertisers to transact directly on our platform through an intuitive and customizable user interface. Campaigns on the Tremor Video DSP are purchased using real-time bidding technology to dynamically purchase individual ad impressions on a real-time basis through integrated inventory pools in an open exchange as well as through private marketplaces that connect buyers directly to selected sellers. The Tremor Video DSP can be accessed on a self-service basis or at varying levels of managed service, depending on the preferences of the buyer.\nIn 2015, we introduced to market a seller platform, the Tremor Video SSP, which helps sellers maximize the value of their video inventory by enabling their programmatic sales efforts and automating workflow. Sellers on the Tremor Video SSP can make inventory available to buyers that are integrated with our technology through a robust auction environment or through private marketplaces so that only selected buyers have the opportunity to purchase video ad inventory.\nThese solutions are still developing, and the future demand and acceptance for these solutions is uncertain and will likely depend on their perceived effectiveness by buyers and sellers. If the market for our programmatic solutions develops more slowly than we expect, or fails to develop, our operating results and growth prospects could be harmed.\nOur business depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to continue to successfully manage and enter into successful strategic relationships with third parties. We currently have and are seeking to establish new relationships with third parties to develop integrations with complementary technologies and data vendors. Our ability to target, verify and measure campaigns is in part dependent on the data that we receive through third party integrations.\nIn addition, the success of our programmatic solutions is dependent, in part, on our ability to integrate our technology with third-party programmatic sources of inventory and demand. The Tremor Video DSP is directly integrated with the largest third party video SSPs, enabling the dynamic purchase ad impressions in an open exchange as well as through private marketplaces. If we fail to maintain existing integrations or attract new supply partners, it could negatively impact the effectiveness of and market for our Tremor Video DSP. We do not have exclusive relationships with these third party SSPs and they are generally under no obligation to provide inventory to the Tremor Video DSP.\nBuyers connect to the Tremor Video SSP through third party DSPs that are directly integrated with our platform. We are reliant on these third party DSPs to increase the amount of spend that is transacted through our seller platform. We do not have exclusive relationships with these third party DSPs and they are generally free to stop transacting on the Tremor Video SSP with little or no notice.\nIn some instances, the third party DSPs that transact on the Tremor Video SSP are also our competitors. As a result, they may be more likely to decrease or eliminate their spending on our platform. Some third party DSPs control significant amounts of advertising spend across a broad spectrum of buyers; therefore, any determination by a third party DSP to materially decrease their spending on our platform could impair our operating results. If we experience connectivity or other technical problems with our integrations with third party DSPs they may be unable to transact on our platform, and any such technical difficulties could lead to a negative perception of our product that could impact future spend decisions.\nIntegrations with third parties are often costly and time consuming, and can present technological challenges. If we experience any delays in our integration efforts or are unable to attract new strategic third parties with whom to integrate our technology, it could impact the efficacy of our solutions and hurt our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may be unable to retain key buyers, attract new buyers or replace departing buyers with buyers that can provide comparable revenue to us.\nOur success requires us to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing brand advertisers, including the ad agencies that represent them, and to develop new relationships with other brand advertisers and ad agencies. Our contracts and relationships with advertising agencies on behalf of advertisers generally do not include long-term obligations requiring them to purchase our solutions and are cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty. As a result, we have limited visibility as to our future advertising revenue streams from our buyers.\nOur buyers\u2019 usage may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 the performance of their video ad campaigns and their perception of the efficacy and efficiency of their advertising spend through our solutions;\n\u00b7 changes in the economic prospects of buyers or the economy generally, which could alter current or prospective spending priorities;\n\u00b7 our access to premium inventory;\n\u00b7 our access to multiple channels and screens;\n\u00b7 our ability to serve video ad campaigns in brand safe environments;\n\u00b7 our ability to deliver video ad campaigns in full, i.e., our ability to serve each requested impression;\n\u00b7 their satisfaction with our solutions and our client support;\n\u00b7 our ability to offer a complete programmatic solution for buying advertising;\n\u00b7 the ability of our optimization algorithms underlying our solutions to deliver better rates of return on video ad spend dollars than competing solutions;\n\u00b7 seasonal patterns in buyers\u2019 spending, which tend to be discretionary;\n\u00b7 the pricing of our or competing solutions; and\n\u00b7 reductions in spending levels or changes in strategies regarding video advertising spending.\nIf a major buyer decides to materially reduce its advertising spend with us it could do so on short or no notice, which could impair our operating results. We cannot assure that our buyers will continue to use our platforms or that we will be able to replace in a timely or effective manner departing buyers with new buyers from whom we generate comparable revenue. Any non-renewal, cancellation or deferral of large advertising contracts, or a number of contracts that in the aggregate account for a significant amount of revenue, could cause an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and harm our business.\nWe may be unable to deliver advertising in a brand safe environment, which could harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.\nIt is important to buyers that advertisements not be placed in or near content that is unlawful or would be deemed offensive or inappropriate by their customers. Unlike advertising on other mediums, online content can be more unpredictable, and we cannot guarantee that advertisements will appear in a brand safe environment. If we are not successful in delivering ads in a brand safe environment, our reputation could suffer and our ability to attract potential buyers and retain and expand business with existing buyers could be harmed, or our customers may seek to avoid payment or demand refunds, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nActivities of our advertising clients with which we do business could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us.\nFailure of our advertising clients to comply with federal, state, local or foreign laws or our policies could damage our reputation and expose us to liability under these laws. We may also be liable to third-parties for content in the ads we deliver if the content violates intellectual property rights of third-parties or if the content is in violation of applicable laws. A third-party or regulatory authority may file a claim against us even if our advertising client has represented that its ads are lawful and that they have the right to use any intellectual property included in an ad. Any of these claims could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could also hurt our reputation. Further, if we are exposed to legal liability, we could be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, redesign our business methods, discontinue some of our solutions or otherwise expend significant resources.\nIf a buyer fails to pay for ad requests that we have fulfilled, we would still be required to pay the seller for its ad inventory.\nSellers provide the video ad inventory on which we run advertising campaigns for buyers through our buyer platform. If a buyer fails to pay for ad requests we have filled, we would generally still be required to pay the seller for its ad inventory. Any significant failure by buyers to pay us could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are highly dependent on advertising agencies, including agency trading desks, and their holding companies as intermediaries, and this may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain business.\nWe are highly dependent on brand advertisers that rely upon advertising agencies, including agency trading desks, in planning and purchasing advertising. Although we maintain relationships with the owners of brands, we do not contract with them directly. Instead, we sell to advertising agencies that utilize our solutions on behalf of their clients. Each advertising agency allocates advertising spend from brand advertisers across numerous channels. We do not have exclusive relationships with advertising agencies and we depend on agencies to work with us as they embark on marketing campaigns for brands.\nIf we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with an advertising agency, we risk losing business from the brand advertisers represented by that agency. If the advertising agency is owned by a holding company, this risk is magnified because we also risk losing business from the other agencies owned by such holding company and the brand advertisers those agencies represent. Consolidation among agency holding companies could increase this risk. Because advertising agencies act as intermediaries for multiple brand advertisers, our client base is more concentrated than might be reflected by the number of brand advertisers that run campaigns through our solutions.\nFurther, our revenue could be adversely impacted by industry changes relating to the use of advertising agencies. For example, if brand advertisers seek to bring their marketing campaigns in-house rather than using an advertising agency, we would need to enter agreements with the brand advertisers directly, which we might not be able to do and which could increase our sales and marketing expense. Moreover, as a result of dealing primarily with advertising agencies, advertisers may attribute the value we provide to the advertising agency rather than to us, further limiting our ability to develop long term relationships directly with brand advertisers. Brand advertisers may move from one advertising agency to another, and, accordingly, even if we have a positive relationship with an advertising agency, we may lose the underlying business when an advertiser switches to a new agency. The presence of advertising agencies as intermediaries between us and the advertisers thus creates a challenge to building our own brand awareness and affinity with the advertisers that are the ultimate source of our revenue.\nIn addition, advertising agencies that are our clients also offer or may offer some of the components of our solutions, including selling ad inventory through their own trading desks. As such, these advertising agencies are, or may become, our competitors. If they further develop their capabilities, they may be more likely to offer their own solutions to advertisers, and our ability to compete effectively could be compromised.\nWe must provide value to both buyers and sellers of video advertising without being perceived as favoring one over the other or being perceived as competing with them through offerings.\nBuyers and sellers have different interests, with each trying to maximize its value in their transactions. We are interposed between buyers and sellers, and to be successful, we must continue to find ways of providing value to both without being perceived as favoring one at the expense of the other. Because new business models continue to emerge, we must constantly adapt our relationship with buyers and sellers and how we market ourselves to each. If we fail to balance our clients\u2019 interests appropriately, our ability to provide a full suite of services and our growth prospects may be compromised.\nIf buyers do not perceive meaningful benefits from outcome-based advertising solutions, then our revenue and gross margins may be adversely affected.\nOur outcome-based pricing models enable buyers to only pay for advertising that \u201cperformed\u201d. Under outcome-based pricing models, buyers only pay us if the applicable performance metrics are satisfied. For example, with our cost per engagement, or CPE, pricing model we are compensated only when viewers actively engage with buyers\u2019 campaigns, such as by interacting with the elements of the video ad through clicks or screen touches or by rolling over certain elements of the video ad for at least three seconds.\nThe market for outcome-based video advertising solutions is evolving and has not yet been widely adopted by buyers. A significant portion of our revenue is generated from ad campaigns that are priced on an outcome basis. We believe outcome-based pricing generally provides greater margins than CPM priced campaigns, because we are often able to serve our buyers\u2019 performance goals with a lower number of purchased impressions. Historically, a larger portion of buyers\u2019 online advertising budgets have been based on the number of impressions served, such as cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, without regard to performance, and such buyers may be reluctant or slow to adopt outcome-based pricing solutions. Additionally, we offer buyers the ability to purchase campaigns on a CPM-basis with a guaranteed demographic reach, or demo guarantees. These campaigns have generally had lower gross margins than our outcome-based pricing models as well as CPM-priced campaigns without demo guarantees. Campaigns priced on a performance-basis or a CPM-basis with demo guarantees are subject to the risk that we may purchase ad inventory that we are unable to monetize if the purchased inventory does not perform for our buyers. If buyers do not perceive meaningful benefits from our outcome-based advertising solutions, our revenue and gross margins may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain or increase our access to premium advertising inventory, our operating results may be harmed.\nOur success requires us to maintain and expand our access to premium video advertising inventory. We do not own or control the video ad inventory upon which our business depends. Sellers are generally not required to provide us with a specified level of inventory, and we cannot be assured that our exclusive sellers will renew their agreements with us or continue to make their ad inventory available to us. Sellers may seek to change the terms on which they offer inventory to us, including seeking an increase in the price we pay for inventory, or may elect to make advertising inventory available to our competitors who offer more favorable economic terms. Furthermore, sellers may enter into exclusive relationships with our competitors, which preclude us from accessing their inventory. In addition, we review our sellers on an on-going basis and have ceased, and may in the future cease, doing business with sellers based on the quality of their inventory, the demographic reach of their inventory, viewer experience and our confidence in the integrity of their ad requests. Further, we may need to improve over time our processes for assessing the quality of seller ad requests. As a result of these factors, we may have limited visibility as to our future access to inventory from sellers or the terms on which such inventory will be made available. If a seller decides not to make video ad inventory available to us on acceptable terms, or if we decide to cease doing business with a seller, we may not be able to replace this ad inventory with comparable ad inventory quickly enough to fulfill our buyers\u2019 requests. If sellers seek an increase in the price we pay for video ad inventory, it could negatively impact our gross margin. Additionally, with respect to CPM-priced campaigns sold with demo guarantees, if we are unable to access inventory targeted to the selected demographic on a cost-effective basis our margins could be adversely affected.\nSellers have a variety of channels in which to sell their video ad inventory, including direct sales forces and third party supply side platforms. Under our exclusive arrangements, a seller\u2019s direct sales force may sell their own video ad inventory, and many of our exclusive sellers maintain significant direct sales forces. Furthermore, the scope of exclusivity with respect to the third-party monetization of video ad inventory varies with sellers, with some sellers imposing geographical, device, or inventory type limitations. Any increase in a seller\u2019s direct sales efforts may negatively impact our access to that inventory.\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase our access to premium video ad inventory or if sellers seek to change the terms on which they offer us such inventory, our operating results may be harmed.\nWe may not be able to adequately satisfy the supply from our exclusive sellers with demand from our buyers.\nIn certain instances, we enter into exclusive relationships with sellers. Substantially all of our exclusive seller agreements obligate us to fill a specified percentage of the video ad inventory that they make available to us, which we refer to as an ad request. In some cases, there is no cap on our fill obligation. If we are unable to deliver ad campaigns to this inventory, we will bear the loss on those\nunfilled ad requests. This risk can be magnified during certain times of the year when we see increased ad requests from our exclusive sellers coupled with reduced purchase demand from our buyers.\nAdditionally, in order to satisfy our required fill obligations, we may have to serve less optimized inventory to our buyers. This may negatively impact the performance of an ad campaign, which could particularly impact us with respect to our campaigns that are priced on an outcome basis. As a result, our margins may be negatively impacted even if we are able to fully satisfy the fill obligation.\nAny significant failure to adequately match demand from our buyers with supply from our sellers would harm our operating results.\nIf we fail to detect fraud or other actions that impact video ad campaign performance, we could lose the confidence of buyers, which would cause our business to suffer.\nOur business relies on effectively and efficiently delivering video ad campaigns for buyers. We have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to fraudulent and malicious activities. An example of such activities would be the use of bots, non-human traffic delivered by machines that are designed to simulate human users and artificially inflate user traffic on websites. These activities could overstate the performance of any given video ad campaign and could harm our reputation. It may be difficult to detect fraudulent or malicious activity because we do not own content and rely in part on our seller partners for controls with respect to such activity. These risks become more pronounced when programmatic buying is in place. While we assess the campaign performance on our sellers\u2019 websites and have engaged third-parties to combat fraudulent and malicious activities, such assessments may not detect or prevent fraudulent or malicious activity. In addition, buyers increasingly rely on third party vendors to measure campaigns and detect fraud. If we are unable to successfully integrate our technology with such vendors, or our measurement and fraud detection differs from their findings, buyers could lose confidence in our solutions and our revenues could decrease. If fraudulent or other malicious activity is perpetrated by others, and we fail to detect or prevent it, the affected buyers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment and our reputation may be harmed. Fraudulent or malicious activity could lead to dissatisfaction with our solutions, refusals to pay, refund demands or withdrawal of future business. If we fail to detect fraud or other actions that impact the performance of our video ad campaigns, we could lose the confidence of our buyers, which could cause our business to suffer.\nOur sales efforts with buyers and sellers require significant time and expense.\nAttracting new buyers and sellers requires significant time and expense, and we may not be successful in establishing new relationships or in maintaining or advancing our current relationships. Our technology and online video brand advertising are relatively new and often require us to spend substantial time and effort educating potential buyers and sellers about our solutions, including providing demonstrations and comparisons against other available services.\nThe sales cycle for newer solutions, such as the Tremor Video DSP, can be particularly long and unpredictable and requires considerable time and effort. Sales efforts involve educating buyers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our platform, as many buyers have limited or no experience with programmatic buying. Some buyers undertake a significant evaluation process that frequently involves not only our platform but also the offerings of our competitors. This process can be costly and time-consuming. As a result, it is difficult to predict when we will obtain new customers and begin generating revenue from these new customers. As part of our sales cycle, we may incur significant expenses. We have no assurance that the substantial time and money spent on our sales efforts will generate significant revenue.\nWith respect to our sellers, we often seek to establish exclusive long-term relationships to ensure access to premium content for buyers. In addition, we are focused on increasing adoption by sellers of the Tremor Video SSP. As a result, we invest significant time in cultivating relationships with our sellers to ensure they understand the potential benefits of our platform and monetization of their inventory with us rather than with third-party media networks, exchanges and supply side platforms. The relationship building process can take many months and may not result in us winning an opportunity with any given buyer or seller.\nBecause of competitive market conditions and the negotiating leverage enjoyed by large advertises, agencies and publishers, we are sometimes forced to choose between losing the opportunity or contracting on terms that allocate more risk to us than or are otherwise less favorable than we prefer to accept.\nIf we are not successful in streamlining our sales processes with buyers and sellers, our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected.\nWe experience fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur operating results have historically fluctuated and our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. Given our relatively short operating history and the rapidly evolving online video advertising industry, our historical operating results may not be useful in predicting our future operating results.\nFactors that may affect our operating results include the following:\n\u00b7 changes in the economic prospects of buyers, the industries we primarily serve, or the economy generally, which could alter current or prospective buyers\u2019 spending priorities, or could increase the time it takes us to close sales with buyers;\n\u00b7 the addition of new buyers or the loss of existing buyers;\n\u00b7 changes in demand for our solutions, including the Tremor Video DSP and Tremor Video SSP;\n\u00b7 changes in the amount, price and quality of available video advertising inventory from sellers;\n\u00b7 the timing and amount of sales and marketing expenses incurred to attract new buyers and sellers;\n\u00b7 the cancellation or delay of campaigns by buyers;\n\u00b7 changes in our pricing policies, the pricing policies of our competitors or the pricing of online video advertising generally, including the relative mix of performance-priced campaigns, CPM-priced campaigns with demo guarantees, and CPM-priced campaigns without demo guarantees;\n\u00b7 timing differences at the end of each period between our payments to sellers for advertising inventory and our collection of advertising revenue related to that inventory; and\n\u00b7 costs related to acquisitions of other businesses.\nOur operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors in some future periods. If this happens, even just temporarily, the market price of our common stock may fall.\nOur revenue tends to be seasonal in nature.\nOur revenue tends to be seasonal in nature and varies from quarter to quarter. During the first quarter, buyers generally devote less of their budgets to ad spending and our exclusive sellers generally make a larger proportion of their ad inventory available to us. Under the terms of our contracts with exclusive sellers we are typically required to pay for a percentage of the ad requests delivered by such sellers, even if we are unable to deliver an ad to that inventory. As a result, this combination may result in lower revenue and gross margins for us during the first quarter of each calendar year. Our operating cash flows could also fluctuate materially from period to period as a result of these seasonal fluctuations.\nWe have made and may make additional acquisitions that could entail significant execution, integration and operational risks.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have in the past acquired, and may in the future acquire, companies, technologies and solutions that we believe complement our business. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u00b7 difficulties in integrating the technologies, solutions, operations, existing contracts and personnel of a target company;\n\u00b7 difficulties in supporting and transitioning clients, if any, of a target company;\n\u00b7 diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\n\u00b7 failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\n\u00b7 failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, technology, or solution, including issues related to intellectual property, solution quality or architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or client issues;\n\u00b7 risks of entering new markets, including international markets, in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u00b7 potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers from either our current business or a target company\u2019s business;\n\u00b7 inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs; and\n\u00b7 possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses.\nIn addition, we may incur indebtedness to complete an acquisition, which may impose operational limitations, or issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership. We may also unknowingly inherit liabilities from acquired businesses or assets that arise after the acquisition and are not adequately covered by indemnities. Additionally, acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results.\nForeign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address the risks described above could materially harm our business and financial results.\nWe have limited international operations and any future international expansion may expose us to several risks, such as difficulty adapting our solutions for international markets.\nWe have limited experience in marketing, selling and supporting our solutions abroad. During each of fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, substantially all of our revenue was generated in the United States. While we have offices outside of North America in Australia, Brazil, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, substantially all of our operations are located in the United States.\nAny future international expansion of our business will involve a variety of risks, including:\n\u00b7 localization of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;\n\u00b7 differing labor regulations where labor laws may be more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States;\n\u00b7 more stringent regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, particularly in the European Union;\n\u00b7 reluctance to allow personally identifiable data related to non-U.S. citizens to be stored in databases within the United States, due to concerns over the U.S. government\u2019s right to access information in these databases or other concerns;\n\u00b7 changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u00b7 challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;\n\u00b7 risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\n\u00b7 different or lesser intellectual property protection; and\n\u00b7 exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.\nOperating internationally requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required in establishing and expanding our international operations will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability. If we invest substantial time and resources to establish and expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will suffer.\nWe have not engaged in currency hedging activities to limit risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in exchange rates affect our costs and earnings, and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside the United States and the amount of our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds to expand our marketing and sales and technology development efforts or to make acquisitions. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Our credit facility matures in December 2016, and we may be unable to renew the credit facility on terms that are acceptable to us. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund the expansion of our marketing and sales and technology development efforts or take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities, which could harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.\nProvisions of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nOur credit facility requires us, and any debt instruments we may enter into in the future may require us, to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 dispose of assets;\n\u00b7 complete mergers or acquisitions;\n\u00b7 incur indebtedness;\n\u00b7 encumber assets;\n\u00b7 pay dividends or make other distributions to holders of our capital stock;\n\u00b7 make specified investments;\n\u00b7 change certain key management personnel; and\n\u00b7 engage in transactions with our affiliates.\nThese restrictions could inhibit our ability to pursue our business strategies. We are also subject to a financial covenant with respect to minimum monthly working capital levels. If we default under our credit facility, and such event of default is not cured or waived, the lender could terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately, which in turn could result in cross defaults under other debt instruments.\nOur assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon a default. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The debt instruments governing such indebtedness could contain provisions that are as, or more, restrictive than our existing debt instruments. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness when payment is due, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our financial performance may suffer.\nWe have expanded our revenue, solutions, scale, employee headcount and overall business operations in recent periods. Our expansion has placed, and our expected future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, operational, product development, sales and marketing, administrative, financial and other resources. For instance, we expect to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new clients, and we plan to continue to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally. Newly hired sales personnel may not become productive as quickly as we would like, or at all, thus representing increased operating costs and lost opportunities which in turn would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we do not manage our growth effectively, successfully forecast demand for our solutions or manage our expected expenses accordingly, our operating results will be harmed. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our financial performance may suffer.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nIn addition to the continued services of William Day, our President and Chief Executive Officer, we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced technical and other personnel in the United States and abroad. We do not have key person insurance on any of our executives. All of our employees, including our senior management, are free to terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business, technology and industry may be difficult to replace. In addition, we believe that our senior management has developed highly successful and effective working relationships. If one or more of these individuals leave, we may not be able to fully integrate new executives or replicate the current dynamic and working relationships that have developed among our executive officers and other key personnel, and our operations could suffer. Qualified technical personnel are in high demand, particularly in the digital media industry, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel also have greater resources than us. Additionally, volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract employees and retain our key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain our senior management and key employees, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nDefects or errors in our solutions could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us, impair our clients\u2019 ability to deliver effective advertising campaigns and impair our ability to meet or fulfill obligations with sellers.\nThe technology underlying our solutions, including our proprietary technology and technology provided by third-parties, may contain material defects or errors that can adversely affect our ability to operate our business and cause significant harm to our reputation. This risk is compounded by the complexity of the technology underlying our solutions and the large amounts of data we utilize. Errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems in our solutions could result in the incomplete or inaccurate delivery of an ad campaign, including serving an ad campaign in an incomplete or inaccurate manner, in an incorrect geographical location or in an environment that is detrimental to the buyer\u2019s brand health. Any such failure, malfunction, or disruption in service could result in damage to our reputation, our advertising clients withholding payment to us, buyers or sellers making claims or initiating litigation against us, and our giving credits to our buyer clients toward future advertising spend. In addition, the terms of our exclusive seller agreements generally require us to pay for a percentage of the ad requests delivered by such sellers, even if we are unable to deliver our solutions due to disruptions in our technology. As a result, defects or errors in our solutions could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us, impair our buyers\u2019 ability to deliver effective advertising campaigns and impair our ability to meet our fill obligations with sellers.\nSystem failures could significantly disrupt our operations and cause us to lose buyers or sellers.\nOur success depends on the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our solutions. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide our solutions, including technological failures affecting our ability to deliver video ads quickly and accurately and to process seller ad requests, could significantly reduce the attractiveness of our solutions and reduce our revenue. Our systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power outages, malicious human acts and natural disasters. In addition, any steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive and may not be successful in preventing system failures. Any such system failures could significantly disrupt our operations and cause us to lose buyers or sellers.\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe collect, store and transmit information of, or on behalf of, our buyers and sellers. We take steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect, store or transmit, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third-parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts. Security\nbreaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur on our systems or those of our information technology vendors in the future. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, or the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses or other harmful software code could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, or loss of information, legal claims and litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory fines and penalties, contractual obligations and liabilities, and other liabilities. In addition, if our security measures or those of our vendors are breached or unauthorized access to consumer data otherwise occurs our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, and buyers or sellers may reduce the use of or stop using our solutions.\nWhile we have security measures in place, these systems and networks are subject to ongoing threats and, therefore, these security measures may be breached as a result of employee error, failure to implement appropriate processes and procedures, malfeasance, third-party action, including cyber-attacks or other international misconduct by computer hackers or otherwise. This could result in one or more third-parties obtaining unauthorized access to our sellers\u2019 or buyers\u2019 data or our data, including personally identifiable information or other viewer data, intellectual property and other confidential business information. Third-parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our buyers\u2019 data or our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure or otherwise to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of data that we store or otherwise maintain on behalf of third-parties may harm our reputation and our relationships with buyers or sellers or harm our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients. Any of these could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify our buyers or sellers or those persons whose information was improperly used, disclosed or accessed. We may also be subject to claims of breach of contract for such use or disclosure, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was improperly used or disclosed. The unauthorized use or disclosure of information may result in the termination of one or more of our commercial relationships or a reduction in buyer or seller confidence and usage of our solutions. We may also be subject to litigation and regulatory action alleging the improper use, transmission or storage of confidential information, which could damage our reputation among our current and potential clients, require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and cause us to lose business and revenue.\nEven if we do not suffer a data security breach, the increase in the number and the scope of data security incidents has increased regulatory and industry focus on security requirements and heightened data security industry practices. New regulation, evolving industry standards, and the interpretation of both, may cause us to incur additional expense in complying with any new data security requirements. Further, any actual or perceived threats to the security of computers and computer networks, especially mobile devices and mobile networks, could lead existing and potential users to refrain from responding to services from our advertising clients.\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities and other third-parties could impair the delivery of our solutions and harm our business.\nWe currently utilize two third-party data center hosting facilities, located in Boston, Massachusetts and Santa Clara, California, and Amazon Web Services to deliver our solutions. All of our data storage and analytics are conducted on, and the video ad campaigns that are transacted through our buyer and seller platforms are processed through, servers in these facilities. We also rely on multiple bandwidth providers, multiple internet service providers, as well as content delivery network, or CDN providers, and domain name systems, or DNS providers, and mobile networks to deliver video ads. In addition, we utilize two third-party data center hosting facilities located in Santa Clara, California and New York, New York for corporate information technology communications, data storage, data processing and office automation. Any damage to, or failure of, these systems within our third-party data hosting facilities or our other third-party providers could result in interruptions to the availability or functionality of our service. If for any reason our arrangements with our data center hosting facilities or third-party providers are terminated, we could experience additional expense in arranging for new facilities, technology services and support. In addition, the failure of our data center hosting facilities or any other third-party providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions in the availability or functionality of our solutions or impede our ability to scale our operations.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, a decision to close our third-party data center hosting facilities or the facilities of any third-party provider without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our solutions. While we have disaster recovery arrangements in place, they\nhave not been tested under actual disasters or similar events and may not effectively permit us to continue to provide our solutions in the event of any problems with respect to our data center hosting facilities or any other third-party facilities. To date, we have not experienced these types of events, but we cannot provide any assurances that they will not occur in the future. If any such event were to occur to our business, the delivery of our solutions could be impaired and our business harmed.\nWe relocated our headquarters and sublet our former headquarters. If our subtenant is unable to meet its obligations under the sublease we may be responsible which could impact our financial performance.\nIn June 2015, we relocated our headquarters; however the lease for our former headquarters does not expire until 2021. In connection with our relocation, we sublet our former headquarters. If the subtenant is unable to meet its obligations under the sublease, we may remain responsible for the obligations under the lease or incur expenses as a result of their breach. Any such unanticipated expenses may impact our financial performance.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carry-forwards, or NOLs, that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. At December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal and state NOLs of $110.0 million and $108.7 million, respectively, and foreign NOLs of $6.8 million and $6.3 million related to our international subsidiaries in Germany and United Kingdom, respectively. The U.S. federal NOLs will expire in various years beginning in 2026 through 2035. Our foreign NOLs can be carried forward without limitation in each respective country. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. We believe that we experienced an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in prior years that may limit our ability to utilize a portion of the NOLs in the future. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, including future offerings, as well as other changes that may be outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to substantially all of our NOLs and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets. Our NOLs may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nRisks Relating to Our Data Collection and Intellectual Property\nOur ability to generate revenue depends on our ability to collect and use significant amounts of data to deliver video ads, and any limitations on the collection and use of this data could significantly diminish the value of our solutions.\nOur ability to optimize the placement and scheduling of video advertisements for our buyers and to grow our revenue depends on our ability to successfully leverage data that we collect from our buyers, sellers, and third-parties such as data providers. Our ability to successfully leverage such data, in turn, depends on our ability to collect and obtain rights to utilize such data.\nWhen we deliver a video ad, we are often able to collect anonymous information about the placement of the video ad and the interaction of the user with the video ad. We currently employ cookies and other tracking technologies to conduct online video ad campaigns. These tracking technologies are used to collect information related to the consumer, such as demographic information and history of the consumer\u2019s interactions with our advertisers\u2019 and our sellers\u2019 websites, and any video ads we deliver. We may also be able to collect information about the user\u2019s location. As we collect and aggregate this data provided by billions of video ad impressions, we analyze it in order to optimize the placement and delivery of video ads across the advertising inventory provided to us by sellers. For example, we may use the collected information to limit the number of times a specific video ad is presented to the user, to provide a video ad to only certain types of users, or to provide a report to a buyer or seller regarding the performance of an advertising campaign or inventory, respectively.\nRisks Related to Data Collected from Consumers\nWe participate in industry self-regulatory programs under which, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and other tracking technologies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising. In addition, consumers can, as of March 15, 2016, opt out of the placement or use of our cookies for online targeted advertising purposes by either deleting or disabling cookies on their browsers, visiting websites that allow consumers to place an opt-out cookie on their browsers, which instructs buyers and their service providers not to use certain data about the consumer\u2019s online activity for the delivery of targeted advertising, or by downloading browser plug-ins and other tools that can be set to: (1) identify cookies and other tracking technologies used on websites; (2) prevent websites from placing third-party cookies and\nother tracking technologies on the consumer\u2019s browser; or (3) block the delivery of online advertisements on websites and applications.\nCookies may easily be deleted or blocked by Internet users. All of the most commonly used Internet browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari) allow Internet users to modify their browser settings to prevent first party or third-party cookies from being accepted by their browsers. Most browsers also now support temporary privacy modes that allow the user to suspend, with a single click, the placement of new cookies or reading or updates of existing cookies. Internet users can also delete cookies from their computers at any time. Some Internet users also download free or paid \u201cad blocking\u201d software that prevents third-party cookies from being stored on a user\u2019s computer or mobile device. In addition, the Safari browser blocks third-party cookies by default. Many applications and other devices allow users to avoid receiving advertisements by paying for subscriptions or other downloads. The browser developer Mozilla, which publishes Firefox, has previously announced an intention to block third-party cookies by default in a future iteration of the Firefox browser, and other browsers may do the same. Mobile devices based upon the Android operating system use cookies only in their web browser applications, so that cookies do not track Android users while they are using other applications on the device.\nAd-blocking technologies have emerged that have the effect of blocking the display of an advertisement. Estimates of the use of ad-blocking technologies vary by user population, type of media content, geography, and other factors, and the ultimate prevalence and effect of ad-blocking technologies is not certain, but it could have an adverse effect on our business if it reduces the volume or effectiveness (and therefore value) of advertising. In addition, some ad-blocking technologies block only ads that are targeted through use of third-party data, while allowing ads based on first-party data (i.e. data owned by the provider of the website or application being viewed). These ad-blockers could place us at a disadvantage because we rely on third-party data, while large competitors have troves of first-party data they use to direct advertising. Other technologies allow ads that are deemed \u201cacceptable,\u201d which could be defined in ways that place us or our clients at a disadvantage, particularly if such technologies are controlled or influenced by our competitors. Even if ad-blockers do not ultimately have a material impact on our business, investor concerns about ad blockers could cause our stock price to decline.\nIncreased prevalence of ad-blocking has prompted examination of the effect of digital advertising industry practices upon the quality of user experiences, and changes in industry practices may emerge as a result. Such changes could reduce the viability of our existing business model, place us at a competitive disadvantage, or require us to invest significantly in developing new technologies and business practices.\nIf consumer sentiment regarding privacy issues or the development and deployment of new browser solutions or other mechanisms that limit the use of cookies or other tracking technologies or data collected through use of such technologies results in a material increase in the number of consumers who choose to opt out or are otherwise using browsers where they need to, and fail to, configure the browser to accept cookies, our ability to collect valuable and actionable data would be impaired. Consumers may become increasingly resistant to the collection, use, and sharing of information used to deliver targeted advertising and may take steps to prevent such collection and use of information. Consumers may elect not to allow data collection, use, or sharing for targeted advertising for a number of reasons, such as privacy concerns or pricing mechanisms that may charge the user based upon the amount or types of data consumed on the device. Consumers may also elect to opt out of receiving targeted advertising specifically from our solutions.\nRisks Related to Data Collected from Sellers and Buyers\nIn order to effectively operate our video advertising campaigns, we collect data from buyers, sellers, and other third-parties. If we are not able to obtain sufficient rights to data from these third-parties, we may not be able to utilize data in our solutions. Although our arrangements with buyers and sellers generally permit us to collect non-personally identifiable and aggregate data from advertising campaigns, some of our buyers and sellers do not allow us to collect some or all of this data or limit our use of this data, and future buyers and sellers may do so in the future. For example, sellers may not agree to permit us to place our data collection tags on their sites or agree to provide us with the data generated by interactions with the content on their sites. It would be difficult to comply with these requests, and to do so would cause us to spend significant amounts of resources. It could also make it difficult for us to deliver effective advertising campaigns that meet the demands of our buyers.\nWe and many of our buyers and sellers voluntarily participate in several trade associations and industry self-regulatory groups that promulgate best practice guidelines or codes of conduct addressing the delivery of promotional content to users, and tracking of users or devices for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising. We could be adversely affected by changes to these guidelines and codes in ways that are inconsistent with our practices or in conflict with the laws and regulations of U.S. or international regulatory authorities. If we are perceived as not operating in accordance with industry best practices or any such guidelines or codes with regard to privacy, our reputation may suffer, we could lose relationships with buyers or sellers, and we could be subject to proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others as described below. Any limitation on our ability to collect data about user\nbehavior and interaction with content could make it more difficult for us to deliver effective video advertising campaigns that meet the demands of our buyers.\nRisks Related to Data Collection Technology\nChanges in device and software features and new technologies could make it easier for internet consumers to prevent the placement of cookies and other tracking technologies. Current versions of the most widely used web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari, allow users to send \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals, to indicate that they do not wish to have their web usage tracked. However, there is currently no definition of \u201ctracking\u201d and no standards regarding how to respond to a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d preference that are accepted or standardized in the industry. The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, chartered a \u201cTracking Protection Working Group\u201d in 2011 to convene a multi-stakeholder group of academics, thought leaders, companies, industry groups and consumer advocacy organizations to create a voluntary \u201cDo Not Track\u201d standard for the web. The W3C is continuing to work on a policy specification that will provide guidance as to how websites and buyers should respond to a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal, but it is unclear exactly what that specification will advise, and to what extent that specification will be accepted by legislators and regulators worldwide.\nEven absent an industry standard, various government authorities have indicated an intent to implement some type of \u201cDo Not Track\u201d standard. For example, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has previously stated that it will pursue a legislative solution if the industry does not agree to a standard. Similarly, the European Commission, which proposes legislation to the European Parliament, has suggested that it intends to consider \u201cDo Not Track\u201d legislation in the absence of an industry standard. Some proposed \u201cDo Not Track\u201d standards, including the current draft specifications being considered by the W3C, impose limits or requirements that apply to data gathering and use by third parties like us, but that may not apply to first parties. Laws or regulations could take a similar approach. Any such standard, law, or regulation could place us at a competitive disadvantage to first-party data owners such as large website operators, many of whom own or are developing or acquiring capabilities that compete with our solutions.\nEffective January 1, 2014, amendments to the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003, California Business and Professional Code \u00a7 22575 et seq., require operators of websites or online services to disclose how the operator responds to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer\u2019s online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services, as well as to disclose whether third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer\u2019s online activities over time and across different Web sites or online services. It is possible that other states could adopt legislation similar to California\u2019s. The Do-Not-Track Online Act of 2013 was introduced in the United States Senate in February 2013, and it is possible that the federal government may adopt Do Not Track legislation. We may be subject to disclosure requirements such as California\u2019s, and while we do not collect data that is traditionally considered personally identifiable information in the United States without user consent, we may nonetheless elect to respond by adopting a policy to discontinue profiling or web tracking in response to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d requests, and it is possible that we could in the future be prohibited from using non-personal consumer data by industry standards or state or federal legislation, which may diminish our ability to optimize and target advertisements, and the value of our services.\nIn addition to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d options, certain mobile devices allow users to \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d on their device. Like \u201cDo Not Track,\u201d \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d is a signal that is sent by particular mobile devices, when a user chooses to send such a signal. While there is no clear guidance on how third parties must respond upon receiving such a signal, it is possible that sellers, regulators, or future legislation may dictate a response that would limit our access to data, and consequently negatively impact the effectiveness of our solution and the value of our services.\nNetwork carriers, providers of mobile device operating systems, and device manufacturers may also impact our ability to collect data on internet-connected devices. These carriers, operating system providers, and device manufacturers are increasingly promoting features that allow device users to disable some of the functionality of the device or its operating system, which may impair or disable the collection of data on their devices. Any interruptions, failures, or defects in our data collection, mining, analysis, and storage systems could limit our ability to aggregate and analyze user data from our clients\u2019 advertising campaigns. If that happens, we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of our buyers, which could make our solutions less valuable, and, as a result, we may lose clients and our revenue may decline.\nIf web, smartphones, tablet and connected TV devices, their operating systems or content distribution channels, including those controlled by our competitors, develop in ways that prevent our advertising from being delivered to their users, our ability to grow our business could be impaired.\nOur business model depends upon the continued compatibility of our solutions with most internet-connected devices across online, mobile, tablet and connected TV distribution channels, as well as the major operating systems that run on them. The design of these devices and operating systems are controlled by third-parties with whom we do not have any formal relationships. These parties\nfrequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. In some cases, the parties that control the development of internet-connected devices and operating systems include companies that we regard as our competitors, including some of our most significant competitors. For example, Google Inc. controls the Android operating system and also controls a significant number of mobile devices. If our solutions were unable to work on these devices or operating systems, either because of technological constraints or because a maker of these devices or developer of these operating systems wished to impair our ability to provide video ads on them, our ability to grow our business could be impaired.\nOur business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\nU.S. and foreign governments and relevant self-regulatory bodies have enacted, considered, or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict our ability to collect, augment, analyze, use, and share anonymous data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tools to track people online. Such legislation or regulation could affect the costs of doing business online and may adversely affect the demand for or effectiveness and value of our solution.\nFederal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, and security of data that we collect across our solutions. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, self-regulatory requirements, policies, and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. As we expand our operations globally, compliance with regulations that differ from country to country may also impose substantial compliance burdens on our business. In particular, the European Union has traditionally taken a broader view as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy laws and regulations. In addition, individual EU member countries have had discretion with respect to their interpretation and implementation of the regulations, which has resulted in variation of privacy standards from country to country. We may be subject to foreign laws regulating online and mobile advertising even in jurisdictions where we do not have any physical presence to the extent a digital media content provider has advertising inventory that we manage or to the extent that we collect and use data from consumers in those jurisdictions. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with U.S. federal, state, or international laws, or regulations, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, or other policies, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. We are aware of several ongoing lawsuits filed against companies in our industry alleging various violations of privacy- or data security-related laws.\nOur subsidiary ScanScout was in the past subject to an FTC inquiry regarding its use of \u201cFlash\u201d cookies. As a result of our acquisition of ScanScout in December 2010, we are now subject to an FTC order regarding certain notice, disclosure and choice obligations regarding the use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising. See \u201cItem 1 - Business - Government Regulation; Industry Alliances\u201d for a more complete description of this order. In addition, ScanScout was subject to a putative class action legal proceeding regarding its use of \u201cFlash\u201d cookies, which was settled in March 2012 and dismissed with prejudice.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is evolving, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices, including some directed at the advertising industry in particular. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways that would affect our business particularly with regard to collection or use of data to target ads to consumers. Some of our competitors may have more access to lobbyists or governmental officials and may use such access to effect statutory or regulatory changes in a manner that commercially harms us while favoring their solutions.\nA number of U.S. state and federal bills have been proposed and are under consideration that contain provisions that would regulate how companies, such as ours, can use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and use information about individuals and their online behaviors. At least one such bill presently has been proposed in the U.S. Congress. The U.S. government, including the FTC and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection of consumer information, including regulation aimed at restricting some targeted advertising practices. The FTC has also adopted revisions to its rules implementing the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA Rules, that became effective July 1, 2013, that broaden the applicability of the COPPA Rules, including the types of information that would be subject to these regulations, and could effectively limit the information that we or our buyers collect and use through certain sellers and the content of video ads our buyers may display.\nIn 2009, the European Union ePrivacy Directive was amended (Directive 2009/136/EC amending Directive 2002/58/EC) requiring buyers to obtain specific types of notice and consent from individuals before using cookies or other technologies to track individuals\nand their online behavior and deliver targeted advertisements. In particular, to comply with certain of these requirements, the use of cookies or other similar technologies may require the user\u2019s affirmative, opt-in consent. Further, the European Commission has proposed a General Data Protection Regulation that may strengthen EU laws regarding notice and consent for tracking technology. The EU proposals, if implemented, may result in a greater compliance burden with respect to collecting information about persons in Europe. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy.\nAny proceeding or action brought against us by a governmental entity or others relating to noncompliance with U.S federal, state, or international laws, self-regulatory requirements, policies, or other legal obligations relating to privacy or data protection could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our solutions, and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless our buyers and sellers from the costs or consequences of noncompliance with privacy-related laws, regulations, self-regulatory requirements or other legal obligations, or inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of providing our solutions.\nChanges in global privacy-related laws and regulations and self-regulatory regimes may also impact our buyers and sellers and adversely affect the demand for our solutions or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For instance, privacy laws or regulations could require digital media content providers to take additional measures to facilitate consumer privacy preferences, in which case we will be reliant upon them to do so. In addition, digital media content providers could become subject to regulatory restrictions that would require them to limit or cease altogether the collection and/or use of data by third-parties such as ourselves. For example, one potential form of restriction on the use of cookies would allow the website that the consumer has elected to visit, a first-party website, to continue to place cookies on the user\u2019s browser or device without explicit consent, but would require the user\u2019s explicit consent for a third-party to place its cookies on the user\u2019s browser or device.\nAdditionally, the March 2012 FTC staff report recommends that websites offer consumers a choice about whether the owner of the website can use third-parties like us to track the activity for marketing purposes (e.g., delivery of targeted advertising). We are a third-party in this context, and therefore currently depend on the ability to place our cookies and other tracking technologies on browsers and devices of users that visit the websites of our digital media content providers and to track devices for the purpose of ad delivery reporting on mobile devices, and if we were restricted from doing so because of compliance with laws or regulatory and industry best practices or recommendations by digital media content providers, our ability to gather the data on which we rely would be impaired. Further, we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to large competitors such as Google, Facebook, AOL, and Yahoo! who have heavily trafficked, first-party properties that would continue to have greater ability to collect visitor data and use such data for marketing purposes.\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union recently issued an opinion finding that the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Framework, under which personal data of EU residents may be transferred to the United States, is invalid and can no longer support data transfers to the United States, which could subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and might hamper our plans to expand our business in Europe.\nThe use and transfer of personal data in EU member states is currently governed under Directive 95/46/EC (which is commonly referred to as the Data Protection Directive) as well as legislation adopted in the member states to implement the Data Protection Directive. The transfer of what is deemed to be personal data of EU subjects to countries (like the United States) that are determined to have inadequate privacy protections for such data currently was previously permitted under, among other methods, a process agreed to by the EU and the United States known as the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Framework, pursuant to which U.S. businesses committed to treat the personal data of EU residents in accordance with privacy principles promulgated by the Data Protection Directive, and could self-certify their compliance with the Safe Harbor Framework.\nWe are a Safe Harbor participant, and previously relied upon the Safe Harbor Framework to allow us to conduct certain transfers of personal data of EU Subjects, including both data about our employees and consumer data that is collected and processed through our technology. Recent developments, however, no longer allow us to rely exclusively on the Safe Harbor Framework to support our data transfers. In particular, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) recently issued an opinion concluding that the Safe Harbor Framework is not sufficient to allow transfers of personal data of EU subjects to the United States.\nGiven the CJEU\u2019s opinion, we can no longer rely on the Safe Harbor Framework to justify the transfer of personal data of EU subjects to the United States. Instead, we must rely on alternative compliance measures. Being forced to rely on alternative compliance measures could also affect the market for our technology, as EU customers may choose to do business with EU-based companies or other competitors that do not need to transfer personal data to the United States in order to avoid the above-identified risks and legal issues.\nIn February 2016, it was announced that the United States and the EU have agreed to replace the Safe Harbor Framework with a new agreement known as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. At this time, however, it is not clear that the Privacy Shield will be embraced by EU privacy regulators or that the Privacy Shield will be an appropriate means for us to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, two U.S. patents and several patent applications, as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties, with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, we may not be successful in executing these agreements with every party who has access to our confidential information or contributes to the development of our intellectual property. Those agreements that we do execute may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. These contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or deter independent development of similar intellectual property by others. Breaches of the security of our solutions, databases or other resources could expose us to a risk of loss or unauthorized disclosure of information collected, stored, or transmitted for or on behalf of buyers or sellers, or of cookies, data stored in cookies, other user information, or other proprietary or confidential information.\nWe currently own two issued U.S. patents and one granted European patent, which we registered in France, Germany and Great Britain. Additionally, we currently own five pending U.S. patent applications that we are currently prosecuting with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, although there can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will ultimately be issued a patent. We also register certain domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We also rely upon common law protection for certain marks, such as \u201cTremor Video.\u201d Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have a patent and certain patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, our existing patents and any patents that may be issued in the future may not adequately protect our intellectual property or provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third-parties. Our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names or business names similar to ours. Domain names similar to ours have been registered in the United States and elsewhere. We may be unable to prevent third-parties from acquiring or using domain names and other trademarks that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brands, trademarks or service marks. Effective trade secret, copyright, trademark, domain name and patent protection are expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights. We may be required to protect our intellectual property in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional patent filings that could be expensive and time-consuming.\nAdditionally, in the United States, the central provisions of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or AIA, became effective recently. Among other things, this law switched U.S. patent rights from the former \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst inventor-to-file\u201d system. This may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more frequently to preserve rights in their inventions. This may favor larger competitors that have the resources to file more patent applications.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent their misappropriation or misuse. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology, which avoids infringing on our intellectual property rights. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our solutions or technology are hosted or available. Further, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. The laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering solutions that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our solutions. In addition, we may in the future find it necessary or appropriate to initiate infringement claims or litigation, whether to protect our intellectual property or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third-parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nOur business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our solutions or another aspect of our business infringes the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe online advertising industry is characterized by the existence of large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property and proprietary rights. Companies in this industry are often required to defend against litigation claims that are based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use.\nOur success depends, in part, upon non-infringement of intellectual property rights owned by others and being able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation without major financial expenditures or adverse consequences. We have faced, and expect to face in the future, claims by third-parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. Such claims may be made by competitors or other parties. We cannot assure you that we are not infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights. From time to time, we or our clients may be subject to legal proceedings relating to our solutions or underlying technology and the intellectual property rights of others, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third-parties.\nRegardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or infringing or misappropriating other intellectual property rights have any merit, these claims are time-consuming and costly to evaluate and defend, and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, and we may receive unfavorable interim or preliminary rulings in the course of litigation. There can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. We may decide to settle lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and are able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. Claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights could:\n\u00b7 subject us to significant liabilities for monetary damages, which may be tripled in certain instances, and the attorney\u2019s fees of others;\n\u00b7 prohibit us from developing, commercializing or continuing to provide some or all of our solutions unless we obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7 subject us to indemnification obligations or obligations to refund fees to, and adversely affect our relationships with, our current or future buyers and sellers;\n\u00b7 result in injunctive relief against us, or otherwise result in delays or stoppages in providing all or certain aspects of our solutions;\n\u00b7 cause buyers or sellers to avoid working with us;\n\u00b7 divert the attention and resources of management and technical personnel; and\n\u00b7 require technology or branding changes to our solutions that would cause us to incur substantial cost and that we may be unable to execute effectively or at all.\nIn addition, we may be exposed to claims that the content contained in ad campaigns violates the intellectual property or other rights of third-parties. Such claims could be made directly against us or against the sellers from whom we purchase ad inventory. Generally, under our agreements with sellers, we are required to indemnify the seller against any such claim with respect to an ad we served. We attempt to mitigate this exposure by generally requiring buyers to indemnify us for any damages from any such claims. There can be no assurance, however, that our buyers will have the ability to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us, and pursuing any claims for indemnification may be costly or unsuccessful. As a result, we may be required to satisfy our indemnification obligations to our sellers or claims against us with our assets. This result could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use open source software in our solutions that may subject our technology to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions, which may cause harm to our business.\nOur technology incorporates or is distributed with software or data licensed from third-parties, including some software distributed under so-called \u201copen source\u201d licenses, which we use without charge. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third-parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine and/or distribute our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners. Although we monitor our use of open source software, we cannot be sure that all open source software is reviewed prior to use in our proprietary software, that our programmers have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary software, or that they will not do so in the future. Additionally, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. There is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our solutions to our clients. In addition, the terms of open source software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop, using such open source software, to others, including our competitors, on unfavorable license terms. As a result of our current or future use of open source software, we may face claims or litigation, be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our technology, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe rely on data, other technology, and intellectual property licensed from other parties, the failure or loss of which could increase our costs and delay or prevent the delivery of our solutions.\nWe utilize various types of data, other technology, and intellectual property licensed from unaffiliated third-parties in order to provide certain elements of our solutions. Any errors or defects in any third-party data or other technology could result in errors in our solutions that could harm our business and damage our reputation and losses in revenue, and we could be required to spend significant amounts of additional research and development resources to fix any problems. In addition, licensed technology, data, and intellectual property may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could result in delays in producing or delivering our solutions until equivalent data, other technology, or intellectual property is identified and integrated, which delays could harm our business. In this situation we would be required to either redesign our solutions to function with technology, data or intellectual property available from other parties or to develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future solutions. If we fail to maintain or renegotiate any of these technology or intellectual property licenses, we could face significant delays and diversion of resources in attempting to develop similar or replacement technology, or to license and integrate a functional equivalent of the technology or intellectual property. The occurrence of any of these events may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company and Public Company Financial Reporting\nWe have restated our prior consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and costs.\nAs discussed in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8 of this report, we have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the first three quarters of 2015 following a change in accounting treatment to reflect the revenue attributable to the Tremor Video SSP net of inventory costs rather than on a gross basis. As a result of the restatement, we are subject to additional risks and may incur unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal and disclosure controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements and other disclosures on a timely basis could be impaired.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, that meet the applicable standards. We may err in the design or operation of our controls. In addition, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. We are, commencing as of the fiscal year 2014, required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm potentially to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to principal-agent considerations around revenue recognition. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a\ntimely basis. As a result of the material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. We are actively engaged in implementing a remediation plan designed to address the material weakness. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. In addition, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources and could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS Act, we have availed ourselves in this annual report, and we expect to avail ourselves in future filings, of the exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; however, we may no longer avail ourselves of this exemption when we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d This will require that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts. Prior to becoming a public company, we were never required to test our internal controls within a specified period, and, as a result, we may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner. Moreover, if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe may in the future discover areas of our internal controls over financial reporting that need improvement. Our internal controls over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we identify new or additional material weaknesses in our internal controls, or we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective disclosure controls and procedures or proper and effective internal controls over our financial reporting, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements and other disclosures, and we may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nOur accounting is becoming more complex, and relies upon estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies. If our accounting is erroneous or based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, and also to comply with many complex requirements and standards. We devote substantial resources to compliance with accounting requirements and we base our estimates on our best judgment, historical experience, information derived from third parties, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, various factors are causing our accounting to become complex. As a result of the introduction of our Tremor Video SSP, we use both gross and net revenue reporting, as opposed to our historical use only of gross reporting. Ongoing evolution of our business, and any future acquisitions, will compound these complexities. Our operating results may be adversely affected if we make accounting errors or our judgments prove to be wrong, assumptions change or actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors or guidance we may have provided, resulting in a decline in our stock price and potential legal claims. Significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, business combinations, and income taxes.\nWe have begun reporting a portion of our revenue on a net basis. The combination of gross and net revenue reporting may make our financial reporting more complex and difficult to understand.\nThe recognition of our revenue is governed by certain criteria that must be met and that determine whether we report revenue either on a gross basis, where third party inventory costs are reflected in cost of revenue, or on a net basis, where third party inventory costs reduce revenue. Before we introduced the Tremor Video SSP, we reported all of our revenue on a gross basis, but we have determined that we are required to report revenue from the Tremor Video SSP on a net basis.\nThe combination of net and gross revenue reporting may make our financial reporting more complex and difficult for investors to understand, and may make comparison of our results of operations to prior periods or other companies more difficult. We may experience significant fluctuations in revenue in future periods depending upon, in part, the nature of our sales and our reporting of such revenue. The need to consider the use of net reporting more broadly for different kinds of transactions as our business evolves would require application of judgment and could increase the potential for reporting errors.\nIn order to provide guidance or make other projections regarding our expectations of U.S. GAAP revenue for future periods, we must make estimates and assumptions about the mix of gross and net-reported transactions based upon the volumes and characteristics of the transactions we think will make up the total mix of revenue in the period covered by the projection. Those estimates and assumptions may be inaccurate when made, or may be rendered inaccurate by circumstances occurring after the guidance is given, such as changing the characteristics of our offerings or particular transactions in response to client demands, market developments, regulatory pressures, acquisitions, and other factors, In addition, the rules governing revenue recognition in our business are complex, and the rules or their interpretation may evolve. As a result, it is possible that our projections of U.S. GAAP revenue guidance may vary from actual results, or comparisons of our projections from period to period may be difficult.\nRisks associated with being a public company.\nAs a public company, and particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and NYSE impose numerous requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these laws and regulations. These requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance compared to when we were a private company. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and not being required to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation or obtain stockholder approval of \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years from the date of our initial public offering in June 2013, although, if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue, if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of any year, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three year period before the end of that five-year period, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of December 31st following such occurrence. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions, in which case the price of our common stock may suffer or there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Between January 1, 2015 and March 8, 2016, our stock price has ranged from $1.65 per share to $3.22 per share. In addition, the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile, and the volatility in market price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n\u00b7 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, or in the market for the stock of comparable companies, from time to time;\n\u00b7 adverse changes in the regulatory environment;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or the results of our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in the market perception of online video advertising platforms generally or in the effectiveness of our solutions in particular;\n\u00b7 a lack of trading volume in our common stock;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations, new solutions, acquisitions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7 issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations for our or our competitors\u2019 stock;\n\u00b7 litigation involving us;\n\u00b7 changes in general economic, industry and market conditions and trends;\n\u00b7 recruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n\u00b7 the other factors described in this section of the report titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action or derivative litigation has often been brought against that company and its officers and directors. In November 2013, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us, our directors and certain executive officers, alleging certain misrepresentations by us in connection with our initial public offering concerning our business and prospects. On March 5, 2015, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the lawsuit and entered judgment in our favor and on February 8, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit confirmed the judgment of the district court. Because of the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of additional securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that a substantial number of shares could be sold, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of March 8, 2016, we had 52,563,181 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, the shares subject to outstanding warrants to purchase common stock and stock option awards for which 39,824 shares and 7,045,044 shares, respectively, were exercisable as of December 31, 2015 will become available for sale immediately upon the exercise of such warrants to purchase common stock or stock option awards.\nWe have also registered for offer and sale all shares of common stock that we may issue under our stock-based compensation plans, including our employee stock purchase plan. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance. Sales of common stock by existing stockholders in the public market, whether as part of an underwritten public offering or pursuant to exemptions from registration, the availability of these shares for sale, our issuance of securities or the perception that any of these events might occur could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the sale of these securities could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock.\nIn addition, in the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, and employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders and their respective affiliates beneficially owned, in the aggregate, a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2015. These persons, acting together, are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or reports about us, our business or our market, if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, or if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the price of our stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts, and their reports or analyst consensus may not reflect our guidance, plans or expectations. If one or more of the analysts covering our business issues an adverse opinion of our company because we fail to meet their expectations or otherwise, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our board of directors or management and, therefore, depress the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or our management. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our stock. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u00b7 establishing a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u00b7 providing that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause;\n\u00b7 preventing the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u00b7 requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u00b7 permitting the board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate;\n\u00b7 limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u00b7 providing that vacancies may be filled by remaining directors;\n\u00b7 preventing cumulative voting; and\n\u00b7 providing for a supermajority requirement to amend our bylaws.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14006, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TLRA"}
