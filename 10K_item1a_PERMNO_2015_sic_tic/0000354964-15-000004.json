{"cik": "354964", "company": "HSBC Finance Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe following discussion provides a description of some of the most significant risk factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in public statements or documents. Some of these risk factors are inherent in the financial services industry and others are more specific to our own businesses. However, other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could also affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and, therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of all potential risks that we may face.\nThe current uncertain market and economic conditions may continue to affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business and earnings are affected by general business, economic and market conditions in the United States and abroad. Given our concentration of business activities in the United States and due to the nature of our historical business as a consumer lender to generally non-conforming and non-prime customers, we are particularly exposed to any additional turmoil in the economy, housing downturns, high unemployment, tight credit conditions and reduced economic growth. While the U.S. economy continued to improve during 2014, challenges remain. General business, economic and market conditions that could continue to affect us include:\n\u2022\nlevel of economic growth and the pace and magnitude of the recovery;\n\u2022\npressure on consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending from other economic and market conditions;\n\u2022\nfiscal policy;\n\u2022\nvolatility in energy prices;\n\u2022\nunemployment levels;\n\u2022\nwage income levels and declines in wealth;\n\u2022\nmarket value of residential real estate throughout the United States;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nmonetary supply and monetary policy;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets;\n\u2022\nunexpected geopolitical events, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar;\nHSBC Finance Corporation\n\u2022\nmovements in short-term and long-term interest rates or a prolonged period of low or negative interest rates;\n\u2022\navailability of liquidity;\n\u2022\ntight consumer credit conditions;\n\u2022\nbankruptcy filings levels and heightened scrutiny by various U.S. Bankruptcy Trustees of proofs of claim and other documents filed by creditors in consumer bankruptcy cases; and\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations or regulatory and law enforcement initiatives.\nIn a challenging economic environment, more of our customers are likely to, or have in fact, become delinquent on their loans or other obligations as compared with historical periods as many of our customers experience reductions in cash flow available to service their debt in such an environment. These delinquencies, in turn, have resulted in higher levels of provisions for credit losses and charge-offs. Although unemployment rates have improved in 2014 and housing market conditions in the U.S. continue to recover, if businesses remain cautious to hire, additional losses could be significant in our consumer loan portfolios due to decreased consumer income. While the U.S. economy continued to improve in 2014, the sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. In the event economic conditions stop improving or become depressed again, there would be a significant negative impact on delinquencies, charge-offs and losses in all loan portfolios with a corresponding impact on our results of operations.\nWhile the housing market in the U.S. continues to recover, the strength of the recovery varies by market. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to a significant backlog of foreclosures in several jurisdictions which will take time to resolve.\nFederal, state and other similar international measures to regulate the financial industry may significantly impact our operations. We operate in a highly regulated environment. Changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting banking, capital, liquidity, derivatives, consumer credit, bankruptcy, privacy, consumer protection or other matters, including changes in tax rates, could materially impact our operations and performance.\nAttempts by local, state and national regulatory agencies to address perceived problems with the mortgage lending industry and, more recently, to address additional perceived problems in the financial services industry generally through broad or targeted legislative or regulatory initiatives aimed at lenders\u2019 operations in consumer lending markets, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including how consumer lending accounts are serviced, limiting the fees and charges that may be applied to accounts and how accounts may be collected or security interests enforced. Any one or more of these effects could negatively impact our results. There is also significant focus on loss mitigation and foreclosure activity for real estate loans. We cannot fully anticipate the response by national regulatory agencies, state Attorneys General, or certain legislators, or if significant changes to our operations and practices will be required as a result.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB which has broad authority to regulate providers of credit, payment and other consumer financial products and services. In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may also narrow the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws and expand the authority of state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act's potential expansion of the authority of state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, we could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing our legal and compliance costs. Although we are unable to predict what specific measures this new agency may take in applying its regulatory mandate, any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in our consumer businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses.\nThe total impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how non-U.S. policymakers and regulators will respond to the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations under the legislation, and how the cumulative effects of both U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations will affect our businesses and operations. Additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States, the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) or in other countries could result in a significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities for the sale of our portfolio or the run-off of certain products, affect the value of assets that we hold, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Accordingly, any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRegulators in the E.U. and in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) are in the midst of proposing far-reaching programs of financial regulatory reform. These proposals include enhanced capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, changes in compensation\nHSBC Finance Corporation\npractices (including tax levies), separation of retail and wholesale banking, the recovery and resolution of E.U. financial institutions, amendments to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the Market Abuse Directive, and measures to address systemic risk. Furthermore, certain large global systemically important banks (\"G-SIBs\"), including HSBC, will be subject to capital surcharges and other enhanced prudential requirements. While the Financial Stability Board has identified HSBC as one of the two G-SIBs that would be subject to a 2.5 percent surcharge, the G-SIB surcharge has not yet been formally implemented in the U.K. The Federal Reserve's proposal to implement the G-SIB surcharge in the United States would only apply to U.S. G-SIBs and would not impose additional capital requirements on us. The Federal Reserve has also issued a proposal for a total loss-absorbing capacity requirement (\"TLAC\") for G-SIBs. The proposed TLAC requirements would be a significant extension of the current regulatory capital framework and could require G-SIBs to issue additional long-term debt or make material modifications to terms of the debt instruments they have outstanding. The TLAC proposal has not yet been finalized by the FSB or formally implemented in the U.S. or the U.K.\nThe implementation of regulations and rules promulgated by these bodies could result in additional costs or limit or restrict the way HSBC conducts its businesses in the E.U. and, in particular, in the U.K. Furthermore, the potentially far-reaching effects of future changes in laws, rules or regulations, or in their interpretation or enforcement as a result of E.U. or U.K. legislation and regulation are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations.\nThe transition to the new requirements under Basel III will put significant pressure on regulatory capital and liquidity. HSBC North America is required to meet consolidated regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, including new or modified regulations and regulatory guidance, in accordance with current regulatory timelines. We will continue to support HSBC North America's compliance with U.S. regulatory requirements, therefore the results of broader regulatory change could impact the availability of funding for us.\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee issued \u201cBasel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems\u201d (the \u201cBasel III Capital Framework\u201d) and \u201cInternational framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring\u201d (the \u201cBasel III Liquidity Framework\u201d) (together, \"Basel III\"). In October 2013, the U.S. banking regulators published a final rule in the Federal Register implementing the Basel III Capital Framework and the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s phase-out of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, which we refer to as the \u201cBasel III Final Rule\u201d. The Basel III Final Rule establishes new minimum capital and buffer requirements to be phased in by 2019 and also requires the deduction of certain assets from capital, within prescribed limitations, and the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in capital. The Basel III Final Rule also increases capital requirements for counterparty credit risk and introduces a supplementary leverage ratio (\"SLR\") that must be publicly disclosed beginning January 1, 2015 and will become a binding measure starting on January 1, 2018. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA began complying with the effective portions of the Basel III Final Rule on January 1, 2014. In September 2014, the U.S. banking regulators adopted revisions to the SLR to align it with the final Basel leverage framework adopted in January 2014. These changes expanded the denominator of the SLR to include derivatives and securities financing transactions. The Basel III Final Rule and the subsequent revisions to the SLR will materially increase our regulatory capital requirements over the next several years. In addition to the Basel III Final Rule, there continue to be numerous proposals or potential proposals that could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial institutions such as HSBC North America. The FSB has issued a proposal for a total loss-absorbing capacity requirement for G-SIBs, which, if adopted and implemented as proposed, could require G-SIBs to issue additional long term debt or modify the terms of certain outstanding debt instruments. The Federal Reserve has also indicated it is considering proposals relating to the use of short-term wholesale funding by financial institutions, particularly SFTs, which could include a capital surcharge based on the institution\u2019s reliance on such funding, and/or increased capital requirements applicable to SFT matched books. Accordingly, there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding significant portions of the capital regime that will apply to HSBC North America.\nFurther increases in regulatory capital may also be required in response to other U.S. supervisory requirements relating to capital. The exact amount, however, will depend upon our prevailing risk profile and that of our North America affiliates under various stress scenarios. Participation by HSBC North America in the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR stress test process will also require that HSBC North America maintain sufficient capital to meet minimum regulatory ratios including a 5 percent Tier 1 common ratio (as defined by the Federal Reserve) over a nine-quarter forward-looking planning horizon, which could also require increased capital to withstand the application of the stress scenarios over the planning horizon. These stress testing requirements will influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us.\nThe Basel Committee has adopted two minimum liquidity risk measures which are applicable to certain large banking institutions, including HSBC North America. The LCR measures the amount of a financial institution\u2019s unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets relative to the net cash outflows the institution could encounter under a significant 30-day stress scenario. The NSFR measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The Federal Reserve and the OCC have adopted rules to implement the LCR with stricter requirements\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nand a faster implementation timeline than the Basel Committee has established. Under the final rules, certain large banking institutions such as HSBC North America began the LCR transition period on January 1, 2015 and are required to be fully compliant by January 1, 2017, two years ahead of the Basel Committee's timeframe for compliance by January 1, 2019. HSBC North America has adjusted its liquidity profile to support compliance with these rules and may need to change their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future final rules. The U.S. regulators have not yet issued a proposal to implement the NSFR for U.S. banking organizations.\nWe may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that we satisfy requirements relating to our mortgage foreclosure processes and the industry-wide delay in processing foreclosures may have a significant impact upon loss severity. As previously reported, HSBC Finance Corporation, and our indirect parent, HSBC North America, entered into the Federal Reserve Servicing Consent Order with the Federal Reserve and our affiliate, HSBC Bank USA, entered into a similar consent order with the OCC following completion of a broad horizontal review of industry foreclosure practices. The Federal Reserve Servicing Consent Order requires us to take prescribed actions to address the deficiencies noted in the joint examination and described in the consent order. We continue to work with our regulators to align our processes with the requirements of the Servicing Consent Orders and implement operational changes as required.\nThe Servicing Consent Orders required us to perform an independent review of foreclosures pending or completed between January 2009 and December 2010 to determine if any borrower was financially injured as a result of an error in the foreclosure process. We refer to this as the Independent Foreclosure Review. On February 28, 2013, HSBC Finance Corporation and our indirect parent, HSBC North America, entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve, and our affiliate, HSBC Bank USA, entered into an agreement with the OCC, pursuant to which the Independent Foreclosure Review ceased and HSBC North America made a cash payment of $96 million into a fund used to make payments to borrowers that were in active foreclosure during 2009 and 2010 and, in addition, is providing other assistance (e.g. loan modifications) to help eligible borrowers. As a result, in 2012, we recorded expenses of $85 million which reflects the portion of HSBC North America's total expense of $104 million that we believe is allocable to us. As of December 31, 2014, Rust Consulting, Inc., the paying agent, has issued almost all checks to eligible borrowers. See Note 22, \u201cLitigation and Regulatory Matters,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCompliance related costs have permanently increased to higher levels due to the remediation requirements of the Serving Consent Orders. In addition, the Servicing Consent Orders do not preclude additional enforcement actions against HSBC Finance Corporation or our affiliates by bank regulatory, governmental or law enforcement agencies, such as the Department of Justice or state Attorneys General, which could include the imposition of civil money penalties and other sanctions relating to the activities that are the subject of the Servicing Consent Orders. In addition, the settlement related to the Independent Foreclosure Review does not preclude private litigation concerning these practices.\nSeparate from the Servicing Consent Orders and the settlement related to the Independent Foreclosure Review discussed above, in February 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and state Attorneys General of 49 states announced a settlement with the five largest U.S. mortgage servicers with respect to foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices. HSBC Finance Corporation, together with our affiliate HSBC Bank USA, have had discussions with U.S. bank regulators and other governmental agencies regarding a potential resolution, although the timing of any settlement is not presently known. We recorded an accrual of $157 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 (which was reduced by $14 million in the second quarter of 2013 and further reduced by $60 million during the second quarter of 2014) reflecting the portion of the HSBC North America accrual we currently believe is allocable to us. As this matter progresses and more information becomes available, we will continue to evaluate our portion of the HSBC North America liability which may result in a change to our current estimate. Any such settlement, however, may not completely preclude other enforcement actions by state or federal agencies, regulators or law enforcement agencies relating to foreclosure and other mortgage services practices, including, but not limited to, matters relating to the securitization of mortgages for investors, including the imposition of civil money penalties, criminal fines or other sanctions. In addition, these practices have in the past resulted in private litigation and such a settlement would not preclude further private litigation concerning foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices.\nAs previously reported, beginning in late 2010, we temporarily suspended all new foreclosure proceedings and in early 2011 temporarily suspended foreclosures in process where judgment had not yet been entered while we enhanced foreclosure documentation and processes for foreclosures and re-filed affidavits where necessary. As of December 31, 2014, we have resumed processing suspended foreclosure activities in all states and have substantially resolved the backlog of loans from the foreclosure suspension either by referring the loan to foreclosure or through other actions, such as a short sale, sold through our receivable sale program or the loan returned to current status. We have also begun initiating new foreclosure activities in all states. The number of properties added to REO inventory during 2014 decreased as compared with 2013 as many of the properties in the process of foreclosure were sold prior to our taking title as a result of our receivable sale program. Additionally, the number of properties added to REO inventory was higher during 2013 as a result of the referral to foreclosure of a significant portion of the backlog of\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nloans from the foreclosure suspension discussed above. Our loan sale program and to a lesser extent, the continued impact of the extended foreclosure timelines will continue to impact the number of REO properties added to inventory during 2015.\nWhile the housing market in the U.S. continues to recover, the strength of recovery varies by market. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to a significant backlog of foreclosures in several jurisdictions which will take time to resolve.\nRegulatory review of consumer \"enhancement services products\" may require us to make restitution and pay civil money penalties. Through our legacy Cards and Retail Services business, HBIO previously offered or participated in the marketing, distribution, or servicing of products, such as identity theft protection and credit monitoring products, that were ancillary to the provision of credit to the consumer (enhancement services products). We ceased the marketing, distribution and servicing of these products by May 2012. The offering and administration of these, and other enhancement services products such as debt protection products, has been the subject of enforcement actions against other institutions by regulators, including the CFPB, the OCC, and the FDIC. These enforcement actions have resulted in orders to pay restitution to customers and the assessment of penalties in substantial amounts. In July 2012, the CFPB issued an industry bulletin regarding its review of marketing practices with respect to credit card add-on products, including debt cancellation, identity theft protection, credit report monitoring, and other enhancement services products. Certain state attorneys general also have filed industry-wide suits under state consumer protection statutes, alleging deceptive marketing practices in connection with the sale of payment protection products and demanding restitution and statutory damages for in-state customers. As discussed in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contingent Liabilities section of the MD&A, we have made restitution to certain customers in connection with certain enhancement services products and we continue to cooperate with our regulators in connection with their on-going review. In light of the actions regulators have taken in relation to other credit card issuers regarding their enhancement services products, one or more regulators may order us to pay additional restitution to customers and/or impose civil money penalties or other relief arising from our prior offering and administration of such enhancement services products, and such amounts, if ordered by our regulators, may be material to our results of operations.\nOur risk management measures may not be successful. The management of risk is an integral part of all our activities. Risk constitutes our exposure to uncertainty and the consequent variability of return. Specifically, risk equates to the adverse effect on profitability or financial condition arising from different sources of uncertainty including market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, compliance risk, liquidity and funding risk, litigation risk, reputational risk, strategic risk, security and fraud risk, model risk, pension obligation risk and regulatory risk. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, such techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every unfavorable event or the specifics and timing of every outcome. Failure to manage risks appropriately could have a significant adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe delivery of our regulatory priorities is subject to execution risk. The financial services industry is currently facing an unprecedented period of scrutiny. Additionally, we are subject to a number of consent orders with our regulators. Regulatory requests, legal matters and business initiatives all require a significant amount of time and resources to implement. The magnitude and complexity of projects required to meet these demands has resulted in heightened execution risk. Organizational change and external factors, including the challenging macroeconomic environment and the extent and pace of regulatory change also contribute to execution risk. These factors could adversely affect the successful delivery of our regulatory priorities.\nOperational risks are inherent in our businesses and may adversely impact our business and reputation. We are exposed to many types of operational risks that are inherent in banking operations, including fraudulent and other criminal activities (both internal and external), breakdowns in processes or procedures and systems failure or non-availability. These risks apply equally when we rely on outside suppliers or vendors to provide services to us and our customers. These operational risks could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Further, there is a risk that our operating system controls as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affect our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as exposing us to litigation or losses not covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to disruption from the external environment. We may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems infrastructure arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include:\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses, electrical, telecommunications, or other essential utility outages;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes or other severe weather conditions and earthquakes;\n\u2022\nevents arising from local, regional or international politics, including terrorist acts; or\nHSBC Finance Corporation\n\u2022\nabsence of operating systems personnel due to global pandemics or otherwise, which could have a significant effect on our business operations as well as on HSBC affiliates world-wide.\nSuch disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers, an inability to collect our receivables in affected areas and other loss or liability to us.\nWe may suffer losses due to employee negligence or misconduct. Non-compliance with policies, employee misconduct, negligence and fraud could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. We are dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if an employee or employees, acting alone or in concert with non-affiliated third parties, causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems, including, without limitation, by means of cyberattack or denial-of-service attack. In recent years, a number of multinational financial institutions have suffered material losses due to the actions of \u2018rogue traders\u2019 or other employees. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not always be effective.\nWe may suffer losses due to employee negligence or misconduct on the part of third parties. We depend on third party suppliers, outsource providers and our affiliates for a variety of services. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including risks relating to break-downs or failures of such parties\u2019 own systems or employees. The Federal Reserve requires financial institutions to maintain a service provider risk management program, which includes due diligence requirements for service providers as well as for our affiliates who may perform services for us. Under Federal Reserve guidance \u201cservice providers\u201d is broadly defined to include all entities that have entered into a contractual relationship with a financial institution to provide business functions or activities. If our service provider risk management and due diligence program is not sufficiently robust, this could lead to regulatory intervention. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, and may result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage or regulatory intervention, all of which may materially adversely affect us.\nA failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyberattacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, and may adversely impact our businesses and reputation. Data quality is critical for our risk and compliance functions as well as for decision making and operational processes. Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process a large number of complex transactions, most of which involve, in some fashion, electronic devices or electronic networks. Data and integrity and accurate reporting systems influence all levels of management decision making, enterprise risk management, governance and our ability to meet our regulatory requirements. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing and other recordkeeping systems and management controls fail, are subject to cyberattack that could compromise integrity, availability or confidentiality of our systems or data, we could be materially adversely affected.\nIn recent years, distributed denial of service (\"DDoS\") attacks, spearphishing campaigns, advanced malware and insider threats have grown in volume and level of sophistication each with the intent to obtain personal customer financial or proprietary corporate information. Such acts can affect our business by:\n\u2022\ncompromising the confidentiality or integrity of our customers' data, potentially impacting our customers' ability to repay loan balances and negatively impacting their credit ratings;\n\u2022\ncausing us to incur remediation and other costs related to liability for customer or third parties for losses, repairs to remedy systems flaws, or incentives to customers and business partners to maintain and rebuild business relationships after the attack;\n\u2022\nincreasing our costs to respond to such threats and to enhance our processes and systems to ensure maximum security of data;\n\u2022\ndamaging our reputation as a result of public disclosure of a breach of our systems or a loss of data event;\n\u2022\nresulting in unauthorized disclosure or alteration of our corporate confidential information and confidential information of employees, customers and counterparties;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our and customers' or third parties' business operations; and\n\u2022\nresulting in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.\nThe threat from cyberattacks is a concern for our organization and failure to protect our operations from internet crime or cyberattacks may result in financial loss and loss of customer data or other sensitive information which could undermine our reputation and our ability to attract and keep customers. We face various cyber risks in line with other multinational financial organizations.\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nWe and other multinational financial organizations have been, and will continue to be subject to an increasing risk of cyber incidents from these activities due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the Internet and customers use of personal smartphones, PCs and other computing devices, tablet PCs and other mobile devices to access products and services to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime for seeking financial gain, hacktivists (geopolitical designated groups), cyberterrorists (attacks against critical infrastructure) and state sponsored advanced persistent threats (\"APTs\") for corporate espionage. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, HSBC Group\u2019s prominent size and scale and role in the financial services industry, and our offering of Internet banking and mobile banking platforms that serve our customers when and how they want to be served. In addition, the consolidation of clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and increased interconnectivity of financial institutions with such central agents, exchanges and clearing houses increases the exposure of cyberattacks on critical parties which may affect us. Evaluating and monitoring the cyberthreat landscape in comparison to our existing capabilities, and adjusting our programs in order to respond to these threats, may require additional capital expenses for human resources and technology.\nOne of our U.S. affiliates experienced disruptive cyber attacks during 2014. While we did not experience any direct attacks in 2014, we may be attacked in the future. There can be no assurance that future targeted attacks from activities of organized crime, hacktivists, cyberterrorists and state sponsored APTs will not result in reputational damage, service disruption and the loss of data.\nFailure to successfully change our operational practices may have a material impact on our businesses. Changes to operational practices from time to time could materially positively or negatively impact our performance and results. Such changes may include:\n\u2022\nour determining to expand our sale of residential mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nchanges to our charge-off policies or customer account management and risk management/collection policies and practices;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain key employees;\n\u2022\nthe level of our investment in technology, business infrastructure and specialized personnel; or\n\u2022\nour outsourcing of various operations.\nFurther, in order to react quickly to or meet newly-implemented regulatory requirements, we may need to change or enhance systems within very tight time frames, which would increase operational risk. Failure to implement changes to our operational practices successfully and efficiently may diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses and could result in reputational damage and regulatory intervention, all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nOur financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in our internal control. In a company as large and complex as ours, lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and we cannot assure you that we will not find one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given future year.\nUncertainty in the U.S. economy and fluctuations in the U.S. markets could negatively impact our business operations. Concerns regarding U.S. debt and budget matters have caused uncertainty in financial markets in the recent past. The downgrading of U.S. debt ratings in the future, as well as any future concerns about raising the U.S. debt limit could, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely affect our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms through our affiliates as well as have other material adverse effects on the operations of our business and our financial results and condition.\nDuring 2014, we experienced improvements in delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent and improvements in charge-off levels as a result of the improvements in the U.S. economy and the continuing recovery in the housing market. While we anticipate the trend for improvements in delinquency and charge-off levels may continue into 2015 at a slower pace, our performance in 2015 is largely dependent upon macro-economic conditions which include, among other things, housing market conditions, employment levels and continued economic recovery, all of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, our results for the year ended December 31, 2014 or any prior periods should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nReceivables held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. The estimated fair value of our receivables held for sale is determined by developing an approximate range of value from a mix of various sources and inputs appropriate for the respective pools of assets. Valuation inputs include estimates of future interest rates, prepayment speeds, default and loss curves, estimated collateral values (including expenses to be incurred to maintain the collateral) and market discount rates reflecting management's estimate of the rate of return that would be required by investors in the current market given the specific characteristics\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nand inherent credit risk of the receivables held for sale. Some of the inputs are influenced by collateral value changes and unemployment rates. Changes in inputs, including the rate of return that investors would require to purchase assets with the same characteristics and of the same credit quality and fluctuations in home price values, could significantly change the carrying amount of the receivables held for sale and related fair value adjustment recognized in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Accordingly, the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded during 2014 should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nWe determine the fair value of the fixed rate debt accounted for under fair value option through the use of a third party pricing service. Such fair value represents the full market price (including credit and interest rate impacts) based on observable market data for the same or similar debt instruments. Net income volatility, whether based on changes in the interest rate or credit risk components of the mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and the related derivatives, impacts the comparability of our reported results between periods. Accordingly, gain (loss) on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives for 2014 should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nFederal Reserve policies can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for investing and the return we earn on our loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. They also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities. Its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in Federal Reserve policies are beyond our control and can be hard to predict.\nOur reputation has a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations. Our ability to conduct business transactions with our counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation, or the reputation of affiliates operating under the HSBC brand, is damaged. Our failure to address, or to appear to fail to address, various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to us and our business prospects. Reputational issues include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nnegative news about us, HSBC, our affiliates or the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022\nappropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nethical issues, including alleged deceptive or unfair lending or servicing practices;\n\u2022\nanti-money laundering and economic sanctions programs;\n\u2022\nprivacy issues;\n\u2022\nfraud issues;\n\u2022\ndata security issues related to our customers or employees;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity issues and cyber incidents, whether actual, threatened, or perceived;\n\u2022\nrecordkeeping;\n\u2022\nsales and trading practices;\n\u2022\ncustomer service;\n\u2022\nactions of a vendor or other third party with whom we do business;\n\u2022\nthe proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our businesses;\n\u2022\nalleged irregularities in servicing, foreclosure, consumer collections, mortgage lending practices and loan modifications;\n\u2022\na downgrade of or negative watch warning on any of our credit ratings; and\n\u2022\ngeneral company performance.\nThe proliferation of social media websites as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets.\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nThe failure to address, or the perception that we have failed to address, any of these issues appropriately could make it difficult for us to conduct business transactions with our counterparties or give rise to increased regulatory action, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur inability to meet funding requirements due to our balance sheet attrition could impact operations. Adequate liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses. The pace of our balance sheet attrition has a significant impact on our liquidity and risk management processes. Properly managing these processes is critical to mitigating liquidity risk. Lower cash flow resulting from declining receivable balances as well as lower cash generated from balance sheet attrition will not provide sufficient cash to fully cover maturing debt in future periods. A portion of the required funding could be generated through planned sales of certain real estate secured receivables. A portion of any funding gap could be borrowed from one or more of our affiliates. We anticipate all future term funding will be provided by HSBC affiliates.\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity as well as the value of our debt obligations. Our credit ratings are an important part of maintaining our liquidity. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies. As indicated by the major credit rating agencies, our credit ratings are directly dependent on the continued support of HSBC. There can be no assurance that downgrades will not occur. A credit rating downgrade would increase future borrowing costs only for new debt obligations, if any. As discussed in previous filings, we do not currently expect to need to raise funds from the issuance of third party, long-term debt going forward, but instead any required funding has been integrated into HSBC North America's funding plans and will be sourced through HSBC USA or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. Similarly, to the extent future funding is to be provided by HSBC affiliates, the credit ratings of those affiliates will affect their borrowing costs and, as a result, the cost of funding to us.\nIn February 2015, Standards & Poor's (\"S&P\") took various rating agency actions on certain European banks, including HSBC, following a review of government support. As a result of this review, the long-term debt ratings of HSBC USA and HBSC Holdings were reduced to A and the long-term debt rating of several HSBC Banks including HSBC Bank USA was put on negative watch. As part of this review, the short-term ratings of HSBC Holdings, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA were re-affirmed. It is not anticipated the actions taken by S&P will significantly impact the ability of HSBC affiliates to provide future funding for us, or substantially impact our costs.\nWe may not be able to continue to wind down our real estate secured receivable portfolio at the same rate as in recent years. Our real estate secured receivable portfolio held for investment is currently running off. The timeframe in which this portfolio will liquidate is dependent upon the rate at which receivables pay off or charge-off prior to their maturity, which fluctuates for a variety of reasons such as interest rates, availability of refinancing, home values and individual borrowers' credit profile, all of which are outside our control. In light of the current economic conditions and mortgage industry trends described above, our loan prepayment rates have slowed when compared with historical experience even though interest rates remain low. Additionally, our loan modification programs, which are primarily designed to improve cash collections and avoid foreclosure as determined to be appropriate, are contributing to the slower loan prepayment rates. While difficult to project both loan prepayment rates and default rates, based on current experience we expect our run-off real estate secured receivable portfolio (excluding receivables held for sale) to be approximately $17 billion by the end of 2016. Attrition will not be linear during this period. Run-off is expected to be slow as charge-offs decline and the remaining real estate secured receivables stay on the balance sheet longer due to the impact of modifications and/or the lack of refinancing alternatives as well as the impact of an elongated foreclosure process. The size of this portfolio and run-off rate is also affected by foreclosures. Upon completion of the foreclosure process, the underlying properties acquired in satisfaction of the receivables are classified as REO and sold separately. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to a significant backlog of foreclosures in several jurisdictions which will take time to resolve.\nWe intend to wind down this portfolio as quickly as practicable in a responsible and economically rational manner, considering market pricing as well as other factors. In addition, and as discussed in prior filings, we plan to continue to sell certain real estate secured receivables. Balances as of December 31, 2014, will be sold in multiple transactions generally over the next 15 months. While we made substantial progress towards winding down this portfolio in recent years, we may not be able to liquidate or dispose of these portfolios at the same level or pace as in recent years or execute the planned sales within expected timeframes. As a result, our ability to continue to reduce our risk-weighted assets or reduce related expenses may be adversely affected depending on the ultimate pace or level at which these portfolios are liquidated and sold. We may be called upon by HSBC North America or HSBC to execute certain other actions or strategies to ensure HSBC North America and HSBC each meets its capital requirements.\nPerformance of modified loans in the current economic conditions may prove less predictable and result in higher losses. In an effort to provide assistance to our customers who are experiencing financial difficulties, in recent years we have modified the terms of a number of our loans. While we have a long-standing history of working with customers experiencing financial difficulties, the number of customers that have needed and qualified for loan modifications in recent years was significantly higher than in our\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nprior historical experience. Under the current economic conditions, the credit performance of these modified loans may not conform to either historical experience or our expectations. In addition, deterioration in housing prices and unemployment could negatively impact the performance of the modified portfolio. While our credit loss reserve process considers whether loans have been re-aged or are subject to modification, loss reserve estimates are influenced by factors outside our control, such as consumer payment patterns and economic conditions, making it reasonably possible that loss reserve estimates could change in either direction.\nA significant rise in interest rates may significantly impact our net interest income which may adversely impact our financial results. Both our Consumer Lending and Mortgage Services\u2019 real estate secured receivable portfolios are expected to continue to remain on our balance sheet for extended durations. Reduced mortgage prepayment rates and higher levels of loan modifications have had the effect of extending the projected average life of these loan portfolios. As a result, both net interest income at risk and asset portfolio valuations have increasingly become exposed to rising interest rates as the average life of our liability portfolios has declined while the average life of our asset portfolios has extended. In the event interest rates rise significantly and we are not successful in fully mitigating such rise or otherwise changing the average lives of our liability and asset portfolios, net interest income, and consequently, net income or loss, would be negatively affected. A significant rise in interest rates could also result in slower repayment rates on performing loans. As discussed above, we plan to sell our real estate secured receivable held for sale balances as of December 31, 2014, in multiple transactions generally over the next 15 months. Additionally, we may be called upon by HSBC North America or HSBC to execute certain other actions or strategies to ensure HSBC North America and HSBC each meets its capital requirements.\nWe may incur additional costs and expenses relating to mortgage loan sale and securitization-related activities. Prior to June 2007, a subsidiary of HSBC Finance Corporation originated mortgage loans sourced by independent mortgage brokers and sold such loans to secondary market purchasers to facilitate whole loan securitizations sponsored or underwritten by several of our counterparties and their affiliates, including our affiliates, HSBC Bank USA and HSI. In connection with these loan sale transactions, we made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. We have been, and may continue to be, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify private investors for losses due to breaches of representations and warranties. We maintain a reserve for potential repurchase liability exposure that, in accordance with applicable accounting principles, represents the amount of loss from this contingency that is both probable and can be reasonably estimated at this time. We estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of our recorded repurchase liability is between zero and approximately $60 million at December 31, 2014 related to claims that have been filed. Because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses are dependent upon economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external risk factors such as housing market trends that may change, the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses requires significant judgment. As our estimate of this exposure is influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in this estimate and actual losses could be significantly higher than the amount reserved.\nParticipants in the U.S. mortgage securitization market have been the subject of lawsuits and governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries, which have been directed at groups such as sponsors, underwriters, servicers, originators or trustees of mortgage securitizations, and at particular participants within these groups. We expect activity in this area to continue. As a result, we may be subject to additional claims, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our participation as a sponsor or originator in the U.S. mortgage securitization market.\nSignificant reductions in pension assets may require additional financial contributions from us. Effective January 1, 2005, our previously separate qualified defined benefit pension plan was combined with that of HSBC Bank USA\u2019s into a single HSBC North America qualified defined benefit plan. As of January 1, 2013, all future contributions under the Cash Balance formula ceased, thereby eliminating future benefit accruals. At December 31, 2014, plan assets were lower than projected plan liabilities resulting in an under-funded status. The accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately $490 million. As these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of this deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up this shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 16, \u201cPension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan.\nLawsuits and regulatory investigations and proceedings may continue and increase in the current economic and regulatory environment. In the ordinary course of business, HSBC Finance Corporation and our affiliates are routinely named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to our current and/or former operations and are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and formal and informal proceedings, as described in Note 22, \u201cLitigation and Regulatory Matters,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, remediation payments, fines, penalties, injunctions and other relief. There is no certainty that the litigation will decrease in the near future, especially in the event of continued unemployment rates, a resurgent\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nrecession or additional regulatory and law enforcement investigations and proceedings by federal and state governmental agencies. Further, in the current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the financial services industry, there may be additional regulatory investigations and reviews conducted by banking and other financial regulators, state Attorneys General or state regulatory and law enforcement agencies that, if determined adversely, may result in judgments, settlements, remediation payments, fines, penalties or other results, including additional compliance requirements, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause us serious reputational harm. See \u201cWe may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that we satisfy requirements relating to our mortgage foreclosure processes and the industry-wide delay in processing foreclosures may have a significant impact upon loss severity\u201d above.\nWe establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nManagement projections, estimates and judgments based on historical performance may not be indicative of our future performance. Our management is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine loan loss reserves, reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities. Certain asset and liability valuations and, in particular, loan loss reserve estimates are subject to management\u2019s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control. Judgment remains a more significant factor in the estimation of inherent probable losses in our loan portfolios, including second lien loans with first lien mortgages that we do not own or service. To the extent historical averages of the progression of loans into stages of delinquency and the amount of loss realized upon charge-off are not predictive of future losses and management is unable to accurately evaluate the portfolio risk factors not fully reflected in historical models, unexpected additional losses could result.\nWe are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income and shareholders\u2019 equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans, future capital requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies, including capital support from HSBC necessary as part of such plans and strategies. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income, future corporate tax rates, and the application of inherently complex tax laws. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Note 12, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our deferred tax assets.\nChanges in accounting standards are beyond our control and may have a material impact on how we report our financial results and condition. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d), the SEC and HSBC North America\u2019s bank regulators, including the Federal Reserve, change the financial accounting and reporting standards, or the interpretation thereof, and guidance that govern the preparation and disclosure of external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report and disclose our financial results and condition, including our segment results. For example, the FASB's financial instruments project could, among other things, significantly change how we value our receivables portfolio, which could also affect the level of deferred tax assets that we recognize. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating of prior period financial statements in material amounts. We may, in certain instances, change a business practice in order to comply with new or revised standards.\nKey employees may be difficult to retain due to contraction of the business and limits on promotional activities. Our employees are our most important resource and, in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. If we were unable to continue to attract and retain qualified key employees to support the various functions of our businesses, our performance could be materially adversely affected. Our recent financial performance, reductions in variable compensation and other benefits and the fact that our remaining business is in wind-down could raise concerns about key employees' future compensation and opportunities. As economic conditions continue to improve, we may face increased difficulty in retaining top performers and critical skilled employees. If key personnel were to leave us and equally knowledgeable or skilled personnel are unavailable within HSBC or could not be sourced in the market, our ability to manage our business and implement the strategic initiatives currently underway may be hindered or impaired.\nHSBC Finance Corporation", "PERMNO": 20124, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "HBC1"}
