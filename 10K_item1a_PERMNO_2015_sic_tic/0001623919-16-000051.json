{"cik": "1623919", "company": "EndoChoice Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks related to our business and industry\nWe must demonstrate to GI specialists the merits of our Fuse\u00ae system, which has only been commercially available since December 2013, compared to standard, forward-viewing endoscopes sold by our competitors, which have been available for over 20 years.\nStandard, forward-viewing endoscopes have been available for over 20 years, while we only began commercializing our Fuse\u00ae system in December 2013. To date, we have sold relatively few units and have a small installed base of systems. Because we have a limited commercial track record compared to our competitors and our Fuse\u00ae system has been in use for less than three years, GI specialists may be slower to adopt or recommend our Fuse\u00ae system to other GI specialists.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to increase sales of our Fuse\u00ae system. GI specialists play a significant role in determining the course of a patient\u2019s treatment and, as a result, the type of product that will be used to treat a patient. In order to increase sales of our Fuse\u00ae system, we must effectively educate GI specialists about our Fuse\u00ae system and successfully demonstrate to GI specialists the merits of our Fuse\u00ae system for use in performing GI endoscopy as well as its advantages over standard endoscopes. Acceptance of our Fuse\u00ae system depends on educating GI specialists as to the quality, diagnostic benefits, ease of use and cost-effectiveness of our Fuse\u00ae system. Of our over 2,500 GI department customers, only two percent have purchased Fuse\u00ae systems, and only approximately 50% of our sales territories have installed Fuse\u00ae systems in those territories to show prospective customers. There can be no assurance that the Fuse\u00ae system will gain widespread adoption or that we will be successful in our efforts to commercialize our Fuse\u00ae system. If we are not successful in convincing GI specialists of the merits of our Fuse\u00ae system, they may not use our Fuse\u00ae system or recommend it to other GI specialists and we may be unable to increase our sales, sustain our growth or achieve profitability.\nIf a GI specialist experiences difficulties during a demonstration of our Fuse\u00ae system or during initial procedures using our Fuse\u00ae system, that GI department may be less likely to buy our system or to recommend it to other GI specialists. It is critical to the success of our commercialization efforts to educate GI specialists on the clinical benefits and the proper use of our Fuse\u00ae system and to provide them with adequate product support during product demonstrations and the initial clinical procedures. It is important for our growth that these GI specialists advocate the benefits of our Fuse\u00ae system in the broader GI marketplace. If GI specialists do not use our Fuse\u00ae system effectively, it could result in an unsatisfactory experience for the GI specialist or negative publicity, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, we believe GI specialists may not widely adopt our Fuse\u00ae system unless they determine, based on their personal experience, recommendations from other GI specialists, available clinical data and published peer-reviewed journal articles, that our Fuse\u00ae system is an attractive alternative to our competitors\u2019 products. GI specialists may be hesitant to select our Fuse\u00ae system for new installations or change to our Fuse\u00ae system for the following reasons, among others:\n\u2022\nlong-standing relationships with competitors and distributors that sell other products and their competitive response and negative selling efforts;\n\u2022\nour lack of an established track record with Fuse\u00ae, concerns that we are relatively new to the business of designing and manufacturing endoscopy systems, concerns about our ability to service the Fuse\u00ae system over many years, and concerns that our competitors have greater financial and other resources than our company;\n\u2022\nperceived liability risk generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u2022\nlack or perceived lack of sufficient clinical evidence supporting clinical benefits;\n\u2022\nreluctance to change to or use new products;\n\u2022\nperception that our products are unproven or experimental, or perceived differences in product performance, reliability, features and ease of use characteristics versus our competitors\u2019 products; and\n\u2022\nthe learning curve and time commitment that may be required to gain familiarity with a new system.\nIn addition, we believe adoption and support of our products by influential GI specialists are essential for market acceptance and adoption. If we do not receive support from these GI specialists in spreading information and generating positive perceptions about clinical performance, or additional clinical data does not show the benefits of using our products, GI specialists may not use our products. In such circumstances, we may be unable to increase our sales, sustain our growth or achieve profitability.\nWe only recently began commercializing our Fuse\u00ae system, and we may never generate significant revenue from our Fuse\u00ae system.\nWe have a limited history of commercializing our Fuse\u00ae system. We may be unable to generate significant revenue from our Fuse\u00ae system or future products for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nresponses of our competitors, such as Olympus, Fujifilm, Pentax and Karl Storz, which are well established companies with strong customer loyalty, established relationships with GI specialists, hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers, and greater capital, marketing and other resources than our company;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to demonstrate differentiation and advantages of our Fuse\u00ae system or future products and the relative safety, efficacy, ease of use of our Fuse\u00ae system or future products;\n\u2022\nthe limited size of our global sales force and the learning curve required for new sales and marketing representatives to become effective in selling and marketing our Fuse\u00ae system;\n\u2022\nour inability to manufacture a sufficient quantity of our Fuse\u00ae systems;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain sufficient and on-time supply of the components for our Fuse\u00ae system or secure second source suppliers if our main suppliers are unable to fulfill our orders;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain manufacturers\u2019 certifications or approvals for cleaning and disinfecting of the Fuse\u00ae system for major brands of washing machines used by GI departments globally;\n\u2022\nour inability to make timely improvements to our Fuse\u00ae system in response to GI specialist feedback or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\ninsufficient financial or other resources to support our commercialization efforts;\n\u2022\nthe installed bases of our competitors\u2019 endoscopy equipment may be subject to long-term lease agreements which can include penalties for early termination, staggered lease termination dates for different parts of the endoscopy systems and automatic renewal clauses, all of which deter and defer the purchase of new equipment.\n\u2022\nour competitors have been in the market for many years and have well established residual values for their used endoscopy systems which may enable them to provide more favorable leasing terms, and\n\u2022\nthe introduction and market acceptance of new, more effective or less expensive competing products and technologies.\nMoreover, many hospital customers, through the contracting process, limit the number of manufacturers that may sell to their institution. Because some of our competitors may offer broader lines of products outside of GI products and services, including lines of products in cardiology, radiology, urology, pulmonology, or other medical specialties, or may be better known, hospitals may choose to contract with our competitors regardless of the differentiating attributes of our products or GI specialist preference for our products. Some of our larger competitors offering products beyond just GI products and services may be better positioned to offer product bundles across multiple product lines with pricing discounts at higher levels. In addition, our competitors may actively position their product portfolios against our product portfolio during the hospital contracting process.\nFurthermore, the specifications of any contracting process may be written so as to exclude our products from consideration. Limitations on the number of hospitals to which we can sell our products may significantly restrict our ability to grow and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile initial clinical studies have shown positive results of our Fuse\u00ae system versus standard colonoscopes, subsequent clinical studies may not be consistent with existing findings.\nOur success depends on the medical community\u2019s acceptance of our products as tools that are useful to GI specialists in diagnosing and treating patients. Current clinical studies, such as the Lancet Study, have demonstrated that our Fuse\u00ae system produces lower pre-cancerous polyp miss rates as compared to standard, forward-viewing colonoscopes.\nWe have commissioned additional clinical studies designed to compare the performance of our Fuse\u00ae system with standard endoscopes. Our competitors, academics, physicians or healthcare organizations may commission similar studies in the future. These studies could yield significantly different results than the clinical studies that have previously been completed. If future studies comparing our Fuse\u00ae system to standard endoscopes show higher pre-cancerous polyp and polyp miss rates, or other results that are not as favorable as the findings in the Lancet Study or other prior clinical studies, the adoption of our Fuse\u00ae system by GI specialists could be impeded, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively in selling our GI products and services.\nOur industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. We face different competitors in our product and service lines, as categorized below.\n\u2022\nImaging systems. In the imaging market, our significant competitors include flexible endoscope manufacturers, such as Olympus, Fujifilm and Pentax, which together represent a significant portion of the GI endoscopy market. In particular, each of these significant competitors have products that directly compete with our Fuse\u00ae system, including EVIS EXERA III from Olympus, EXPX-2500 from Fujifilm and Pentax\u2019s RetroView Colonoscope. There is also the potential for new entrants to the market, particularly those based in China, as manufacturing capabilities grow.\n\u2022\nTherapeutic devices. In the device market, our significant competitors include Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Olympus, Medivators/Cantel and Steris/US Endoscopy, all of which sell GI endoscopy devices. At any time, these and other potential market entrants may develop new devices or treatment alternatives that may compete directly with our GI products.\n\u2022\nInfection control products. In the infection control market, our significant competitors include Medivators/Cantel, Ruhof, Medline, Cardinal Health and Steris/US Endoscopy, all of which sell infection control products that directly compete with our product offerings, including procedure kits, personal protection products, enzymatics and high-level disinfectants.\n\u2022\nDiagnostics. The diagnostics market, including pathology services, is highly fragmented. Our primary competitors include GI groups with in-office pathology labs, independent pathology labs, hospital-based pathology labs, and large diagnostic companies, including LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics.\nAt any time, these or other GI market participants may develop alternative products or services that compete directly or indirectly with our products and services. They may also develop and patent products or processes earlier than we can or obtain regulatory clearance, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity for competing products more rapidly than we can, which could impair our ability to develop and commercialize similar products or processes. If clinical outcomes of procedures performed with our competitors\u2019 products are, or are perceived to be, superior to procedures performed with our products, sales of our products could be negatively affected and our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nMany of our current and potential competitors are publicly traded, or are divisions of publicly-traded, major medical device or technology companies that enjoy several competitive advantages. We face a challenge overcoming the long-standing preferences of some GI specialists for using the products of our larger, more established competitors. GI specialists who have completed many successful procedures using the products made by these competitors may be reluctant to try new products from a source with which they are less familiar. If these GI specialists do not try and subsequently adopt our products and services, then our revenue growth will slow or decline. In addition, many of our competitors enjoy other advantages such as:\n\u2022\ngreater financial resources enabling them to market and discount aggressively;\n\u2022\nlarge and established sales, marketing and worldwide distribution networks which have greater reach in both domestic and international markets;\n\u2022\nsignificantly greater brand recognition;\n\u2022\nestablished business and financial relationships with many more GI specialists, referring physicians, hospitals and medical schools;\n\u2022\ngreater existing market share in the GI endoscopy product market;\n\u2022\ngreater resources devoted to research and development of competing products and greater capacity to allocate additional resources;\n\u2022\ngreater experience in obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity for new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nsignificantly larger installed bases of equipment, with many systems being subject to non-cancellable long-term lease contracts and service agreements and various customer loyalty programs; and\n\u2022\nmore expansive patent portfolios and other intellectual property rights.\nFurther, product pricing can be a significant factor in purchasing decisions. The development of cheaper technologies or the lowering of prices by our competitors could cause GI departments to choose products other than ours. Even if we are able to maintain our relative pricing, competition among a large number of well-established companies could cause overall price erosion in the marketplace, which could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market for GI endoscopy products is becoming increasingly crowded with new participants. Many of these new competitors specialize in a specific product or focus on a particular market segment, making it more difficult for us to increase our overall market position. The frequent introduction by competitors of products that are, or claim to be, superior to our products or that are alternatives to our existing or planned products may also create market confusion making it difficult to differentiate the benefits of our products over competing products. In addition, the entry of multiple new products and competitors may lead some of our competitors to employ pricing strategies that could adversely affect the pricing of our products and pricing in the market for GI endoscopy products generally.\nIf we are unable to expand, manage and maintain our direct sales and marketing organizations, we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our direct sales and marketing organizations consisted of 128 employees and covered 55 sales territories in the United States. Our future success will be directly dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our employees. If our sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell our products, our sales may suffer.\nIn order to generate our anticipated sales, we will need to expand the size and geographic scope of our direct sales organization. There is significant competition for qualified and experienced sales personnel. Once hired, the training process is lengthy because it requires significant education of new sales representatives to achieve the level of clinical competency with our products expected by GI specialists. Upon completion of the training, our sales representatives typically require lead time in the field to grow their network of accounts and achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach in any individual territory. If we are unable to attract, motivate, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel, or if our sales representatives do not achieve the productivity levels in the time period we expect them to reach, our revenue will not grow at the rate we expect and our business, results of operations and financial condition will suffer. Also, to the extent we hire sales personnel from our competitors, we may be required to wait until applicable non-competition provisions have expired before deploying such personnel in restricted territories or incur costs to relocate personnel outside of such territories. In addition, we have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to allegations that these new hires have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged to us proprietary or other confidential information of their former employers. Any of these risks may adversely affect our ability to increase sales of our products. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we are in the process of transitioning our sales force from selling less expensive single use products to nurses and procedure room supervisors to also selling more complex capital equipment (such as our Fuse\u00ae system) to GI specialists and senior administrators. There are significant differences in these processes, such as a longer sales cycle, the evaluation of possible financing options, and more requirements for approvals in the purchasing decisions for more expensive capital equipment. If we are unable to increase the effectiveness of our sales force, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf alternative diagnostic methods or technologies for GI disease screening gain greater market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nSome western European countries have introduced into their screening programs a preliminary step before colonoscopy. In these countries, the patient is first asked to perform a non-invasive \u201cat home\u201d stool test referred to as either a fecal occult blood test, or FOBT, or fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. A physician interprets the results and if the results of this test are positive, the patient is instructed to proceed to a colonoscopy. In the United States, FOBT and FIT are sometimes used as adjuncts to colonoscopy, but insurance companies generally do not require their use prior to screening colonoscopy. FDA recently approved a non-invasive, DNA-based stool test for use in the United States as an alternative option to screen for colorectal cancer. The newly approved test requires less preparation by the patient and detects hemoglobin, a protein molecule that is a component of blood as well as certain mutations associated with colorectal cancer in the DNA of cells shed by advanced pre-cancerous polyps, as stool moves through the large intestine and rectum.\nOther competitors have introduced pill camera technologies as another alternative method of screening the GI tract for lesions. The patient swallows a pill that houses a battery, light and lenses, which travels through the GI tract while wirelessly transmitting images to a specialist. The patient must limit physical activity during the approximate 10 hours that it takes the pill to travel through the GI tract. The specialist reviews the transmitted images and if any colon abnormalities are detected, the patient is instructed to proceed to a colonoscopy.\nAnother alternative procedure to screen for pre-cancerous polyps is the use of diagnostic imaging, including computed tomography, or CT, or magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. In these cases, a specialist takes a scan of the patient\u2019s GI tract and analyzes the results for the presence of any colon abnormalities. If any colon abnormalities are detected, the patient is instructed to proceed to a colonoscopy.\nIn addition, some companies are exploring new technologies that would enable more convenient or cost-effective diagnostic testing that would compete with our clinical pathology services. In the future, these competitors may offer testing that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices.\nIf any of these or other alternative diagnostic methods are adopted by a greater number of GI specialists and GI departments, the number of screening colonoscopies or demand for our clinical pathology services could decline, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nWe have incurred losses in the past and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have historically incurred significant losses. We incurred net losses of $(23.9) million, $(53.6) million, and $(59.4) million in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. As a result of such losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $ (156.5) million at December 31, 2015. We expect to continue to incur significant, and in certain instances increased, expenses for product development, manufacturing scale-up, sales and marketing and other expenses as we commercialize our Fuse\u00ae system. Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase due to the additional operational and reporting costs associated with being a public company as well as stock compensation expense. We will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve and maintain profitability, and even if we achieve profitability, we cannot be sure that we will remain profitable for any substantial period of time. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact our ability to access additional financing on acceptable terms.\nOur actual financial results may vary significantly from financial forecasts.\nOur limited operating history and commercial experience and the recent launch of our Fuse\u00ae system make it difficult for us to predict future performance. As we gain additional commercial experience with respect to our business and continue marketing our Fuse\u00ae system, a number of factors over which we have limited control or visibility may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results. We are subject to seasonal variations in revenue and gross profit. In addition, our results can be impacted by adverse weather and by resetting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles, both of which may cause patients to delay elective procedures. Demand and timing for GI endoscopy purchases and procedures may also be impacted by provider budgetary cycles and by the desire of patients to spend their remaining balances in flexible-spending accounts or because they have met their annual deductibles under their health insurance plans. In addition, sale cycles for medical capital equipment such as our Fuse\u00ae system are longer than other products, which may result in revenue variations caused by the timing of the receipt of customer orders or the shipment of our systems. In the third quarter, the number of GI endoscopy procedures nationwide is historically lower than other quarters throughout the year, which we believe is attributable to the summer vacations of GI specialists and their patients. Other factors that may impact our results include:\n\u2022\nGI specialist adoption of our products;\n\u2022\npricing pressure resulting from actions by our competitors, payors or others;\n\u2022\nthe hiring, retention and continued productivity of our sales representatives;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand the geographic reach of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical studies and trials on our or our competitors\u2019 existing products and products in development;\n\u2022\nour ability to predict manufacturing and delivery needs;\n\u2022\ndelays in approval or receipt of anticipated purchase orders from customers or distributors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers or distributors to obtain financing for purchases of our Fuse\u00ae system;\n\u2022\ntiming of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nunexpected delays in regulatory approvals necessary to launch new products;\n\u2022\ndelays in, or failure of, component and product deliveries by our suppliers and manufacturers; and\n\u2022\npositive or negative coverage in the media or clinical publications of our products or products of our competitors or our industry.\nIn the event our actual revenue and results of operations do not meet our expectations for a particular period, the market price of our common stock may decline substantially.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions, which may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, which has driven numerous cost reform initiatives by legislators, regulators and third-party payors. Private insurer payment rates vary based on contractual agreements between the providers and the insurance companies. Cost containment initiatives have elicited a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power, which may create requests for pricing concessions in the future. Additionally, group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts may continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions and reduce the number of approved vendors for hospitals and ASCs. GI specialists are increasingly consolidating their practices or joining hospital groups, which could also impact purchasing decisions and reduce the number of existing and potential customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the healthcare industry worldwide, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products or limit our access to certain healthcare providers and may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf coverage, reimbursement and pricing from third-party payors for procedures using our products significantly decline, GI departments in hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare providers may be reluctant to purchase, or may delay purchase, of our products, or may be willing to pay less for our products, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur imaging and single-use product customers, which include GI departments in hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare providers, directly bill third-party payors for reimbursement for GI endoscopy procedures that they provide to patients using our products. As a manufacturer of imaging and single-use products, we do not control the billing practices of our customers.\nCoverage for colonoscopy procedures provided by our imaging and single-use product customers is generally well-established among third-party payors. For example, the Medicare program has covered colorectal cancer screening tests (including screening colonoscopies) since 1998, as required by Section 4104 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Currently, Medicare covers screening colonoscopy procedures once every 24 months for beneficiaries who are at high risk for colorectal cancer, once every 120 months for beneficiaries who are at average risk for colorectal cancer, and 48 months after a previous flexible sigmoidoscopy. Medicare does not impose cost-sharing requirements on beneficiaries for screening colonoscopies, unless the procedure results in the biopsy or removal of a polyp or growth during the same visit, in which case the procedure is considered diagnostic and a copay or coinsurance may be required. Also, Section 1001 of the ACA requires \u201cnon-grandfathered\u201d group health plans (new plans sold or renewed on or after September 23, 2010) to cover certain preventative services, including screening colonoscopies, without cost-sharing requirements.\nOur customers\u2019 access to adequate coverage and reimbursement by government and third-party payors for the procedures performed using our products is central to the acceptance of our current and future products. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if government and third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of reimbursement for the procedures in which our products are used. Changes in the amount such payors are willing to reimburse our customers for procedures using our products could create pricing pressure for us. If competitive forces drive down the prices we are able to charge for our products, our gross margins will shrink, which will adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business.\nTo contain costs of new technologies, governmental healthcare programs and third-party payors are increasingly scrutinizing new and existing technologies by requiring extensive evidence of favorable clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness. Other cost-control methods include prospective payment systems, bundled payment models, capitated arrangements, group purchasing, benefit redesign and pre-authorization processes. These cost-control methods also potentially limit the amount that healthcare providers may be willing to pay for medical devices.\nGI departments in hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these third-party payors for the cost of the procedures using our products. Payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can, without notice, deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of our products. If we are not successful in reversing existing non-coverage policies, if other third-party payors issue similar policies or if our customers are not able to be reimbursed at cost-effective levels, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, some healthcare providers in the United States have adopted or are considering a managed care system in which providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person. Healthcare payors may attempt to control costs by limiting access to GI procedures. Additionally, federal healthcare reform, changes in reimbursement policies or healthcare cost containment initiatives may limit or restrict coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products and cause our revenue to decline.\nOutside of the United States, reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many foreign markets have government-managed healthcare systems that govern reimbursement for GI procedures. Additionally, some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods and longer wait times for procedures. If adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors outside of the United States are not obtained, international sales of our products may decline.\nGovernment and third-party payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of clinical pathology services.\nWe face efforts by government and third-party payors to reduce utilization and reimbursement of clinical pathology services.\nAmounts paid by payors for clinical pathology services are determined by the MPFS. From time to time, Congress has legislated reductions in, or has frozen updates to, the MPFS. In addition, CMS, has adopted policies reducing reimbursement rates for clinical pathology services that we perform. For example, in 2013, CMS reduced the \u201ctechnical component\u201d of the payment for the clinical pathology services we perform by about 52%, and decreased overall Medicare payment for the service by 33%. CMS has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis, commonly known as ICD-10, which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses. If we do not adequately implement the new coding set, our clinical pathology business could be adversely impacted. In addition, if as a result of the new coding set, GI departments fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests, we may not be reimbursed for such tests. We also provide anatomic pathology services which are reimbursed by Medicare under a physician fee schedule and are subject to adjustment on an annual basis. Medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures. Recently adopted federal healthcare reform legislation includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels.\nFrom time to time, the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding can be used to provide clinical pathology services for Medicare beneficiaries at lower rates while maintaining quality and access to care. If competitive bidding is implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical pathology services, it could materially adversely affect us. Congress periodically considers cost-saving initiatives as part of its deficit reduction discussions. These initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical laboratory services, co-payments for clinical laboratory testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions. If any of these initiatives is implemented, it could materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, federal healthcare programs have continued to increase the levels of auditing of claims and payments for clinical pathology services. These audits are designed to reduce utilization and control costs and can result in denied claims for payment, recoupments of paid claims and, in some cases, allegations of the submission of false claims for payment. Increasing audit levels increase our costs for providing clinical pathology services and can materially decrease our overall reimbursement.\nWe also face efforts by non-governmental third-party payors, including health plans, to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical pathology services. For example, in light of the ACA there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including a model under which pathology services would be included as part of a bundled payment.\nThe healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical pathology providers. These health plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical pathology providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements. In addition, some health plans have been willing to limit the preferred provider organization or point of service laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved fee-for-service pricing. Some health plans also are considering steps such as requiring preauthorization of testing. There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing.\nThe increased consolidation among health plans also has increased the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer. Recently adopted federal healthcare reform legislation includes provisions, including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges, that may encourage health insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting.\nWe expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical pathology services. These efforts, including future changes in third-party payor rules, practices and policies, or ceasing to be a contracted provider to a health plan, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to timely or accurately bill for our clinical pathology services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBilling for clinical pathology services is extremely complex and is subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payors, such as insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid and patients. Changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process. Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process. Further, our billing systems require significant technology investment and, as a result of marketplace demands, we must continually invest in our billing systems.\nMissing or incorrect information on requisitions for our clinical pathology services adds complexity to and slows the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions, and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense. Failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs could lead to various penalties, including: (1) exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nWe have a relatively short history of operating as a commercial company and have been growing rapidly in recent periods. We intend to continue to grow and may experience future periods of rapid growth and expansion, which could place a significant additional strain on our senior management team, our other personnel, information technology systems and operating procedures. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals.\nTo achieve our revenue goals, we must successfully increase manufacturing output to meet expected customer demand. In the future, we may experience difficulties with manufacturing yields, quality control, component supply and shortages of qualified personnel, among other problems. These problems could result in delays in product availability and increases in expenses. Any such delay or increased expense could adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability.\nFuture growth will also impose significant added responsibilities on the management of our sales and marketing teams, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional sales representatives. In addition, rapid and significant growth will place a strain on our executive, administrative and operational infrastructure.\nIn order to manage our operations and growth we will need to continue to improve our operational and management controls, reporting and information technology systems and financial internal control procedures. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nOur future success depends on our ability to develop, receive regulatory clearance or approval for, introduce and commercialize new GI endoscopy products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market in a timely manner.\nIn order to serve the needs of our customers, we must enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands and competitive pressures and technologies. We might not be able to successfully develop, protect as proprietary or obtain timely regulatory approval, clearance or CE Certificates of Conformity to market new products, and our future products may not be accepted by GI departments or the third-party payors who reimburse for many of the procedures performed with our products.\nFurthermore, commercializing additional products or enhancing existing products is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our current GI endoscopy products and harm our business. Even if we are successful in commercializing additional products, the success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate GI caregiver needs and preferences;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nobtain intellectual property of appropriate scope to adequately protect new products, while avoiding infringement upon or other violation of the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022\nconduct clinical studies or collect existing clinical data, when relevant;\n\u2022\nmanufacture and market new or modified products in full compliance with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nprovide adequate training to potential users of our new products, if necessary;\n\u2022\nensure adequate coverage and reimbursement for any GI procedures performed with our new products;\n\u2022\ncomply fully with FDA and foreign regulations before marketing of new or modified products;\n\u2022\ndevelop an effective and regulatory-compliant, dedicated sales and marketing team;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity for new products or product enhancements or modifications, including enhancements or modifications to our Fuse\u00ae system.\nIf we do not develop and obtain regulatory clearance, approval or CE Certificates of Conformity for new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, we may not be able to increase our revenue and our costs could increase. Our research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology or other innovation. In addition, even if we are able to develop enhancements or new generations of our products successfully, these enhancements or new generations of products may not be patentable, or may not be patentable in sufficient scope to adequately protect the product or provide any competitive advantage. If we are required to obtain a license to intellectual property from third parties in order to develop, produce and otherwise commercialize such products without infringing or otherwise violating such intellectual property, the cost of producing the products may discourage commercialization. These enhancements or new generations of products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nWe may not be able to successfully complete any future acquisitions.\nWe may grow our business through the acquisition of additional products, technologies, services or businesses that we believe have significant commercial potential. Any growth through acquisitions will be dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and on acceptable terms and conditions. Even if these opportunities are present, we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired companies or achieve the commercial potential or synergies projected for any acquisition. Future acquisitions may also divert management\u2019s attention from other business activities. Other companies, many of which may have substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, compete with us for these acquisition opportunities.\nWe are dependent upon third-party manufacturers and suppliers, in some cases sole-or single-source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and problems, and price fluctuations, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on third-party suppliers for our products. In particular, we rely on several single-source suppliers that manufacture and assemble certain components of our Fuse\u00ae system.\nFor us to be successful, our suppliers must be able to provide us with products and components in substantial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis, as needed. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured all of our products and their components ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility that products will not be delivered on a timely basis, the possibility of increases in pricing for our products, the possibility of breach by the third party of the manufacturing agreements, the possibility of patent or other intellectual property infringement or misappropriation by the third party, and the possibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party.\nOur suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including, for example, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, equipment malfunction and environmental factors, failure to properly conduct their own business affairs, and infringement or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our requirements.\nOur reliance on these third-party suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could adversely affect the quality of our products or our ability to deliver them in a timely manner, and harm our ability to successfully commercialize our products, including:\n\u2022\nfor many of our suppliers, we are not a major customer and these suppliers may therefore give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours and other customers may use fair or unfair negotiation tactics and/or pressures to impede our relationship with the supplier;\n\u2022\nthird parties may threaten or enforce their intellectual property rights against our suppliers, which may cause disruptions or delays in shipment, or may force our suppliers to cease conducting business with us;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the demand for our products or our inability to forecast demand accurately may influence the willingness or ability of our suppliers to meet our delivery needs;\n\u2022\nour suppliers, especially new suppliers, may make errors in manufacturing or may not adhere to quality requirements or standards;\n\u2022\nif necessary components become obsolete, we may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers or may be unable to find new or alternative components or reconfigure our products and manufacturing processes in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to price fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components or changes in foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in orders for components that our suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability or willingness to deliver components to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour suppliers may wish to discontinue supplying components or services to us for risk management or product liability reasons;\n\u2022\nswitching components or suppliers may require product redesign and possibly approval or clearance from FDA, regulatory bodies of the EEA, or other foreign regulatory bodies;\n\u2022\none or more of our sole-or single-source suppliers may be unwilling or unable to supply components of our products;\n\u2022\nwe or our suppliers may not be able to respond to unanticipated changes in customer orders, and if orders do not match forecasts, we or our suppliers may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of a fire, natural disaster, terrorist or military event or other catastrophe impacting one or more of our suppliers may affect their ability to deliver components to us in a timely manner; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers may encounter financial or other business hardships unrelated to our demand or beyond our control, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nWe may not be able to quickly establish additional or alternative suppliers if necessary, in part because we may need to undertake additional activities to establish such suppliers as required by the regulatory approval process. Any interruption or delay in obtaining components from our third-party suppliers, or our inability to obtain components from qualified alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to switch to competing products. Given our reliance on certain single-source suppliers, we are especially susceptible to supply shortages because we do not have alternate suppliers currently available.\nThere are a limited number of suppliers and third-party manufacturers that operate under FDA\u2019s QSR requirements, maintain certifications from the ISO that are recognized as harmonized standards in the EEA, and that have the necessary expertise and capacity to manufacture components for our products. As a result, it may be difficult for us to locate manufacturers for our anticipated future needs, and our anticipated growth could strain the ability of our current suppliers to deliver products, materials and components to us. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing of components for our products, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of, market and sell our current or new products.\nThe introduction of new or alternative components for our products may require design changes to our products that are subject to FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals or new CE Certificates of Conformity. We may also be required to assess any new manufacturer\u2019s compliance with all applicable regulations and guidelines, which could further impede our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner. As a result, we could incur increased production costs, experience delays in deliveries of our products and suffer damage to our reputation.\nOur ability to compete effectively and achieve profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to reduce the per unit manufacturing cost of our Fuse\u00ae system.\nTo achieve our operating and strategic goals, we will need to reduce the per unit manufacturing cost of our Fuse\u00ae system. This cannot be achieved without increasing the volume of components that we purchase in order to take advantage of volume based pricing discounts, improving manufacturing efficiency and reducing waste, increasing sales of our products to leverage manufacturing overhead costs or initiating product redesign efforts to reduce the number and cost of components and improve manufacturability. If we are unable to reduce the per unit cost of our Fuse\u00ae system, our ability to competitively price our product, increase sales and achieve profitability will be severely constrained. Any increase in manufacturing volumes is dependent upon a corresponding increase in sales. The occurrence of one or more factors that negatively impact the manufacturing or sales of our Fuse\u00ae system or reduce our manufacturing efficiency may prevent us from achieving our revenue targets or desired reduction in manufacturing costs.\nSome of our manufacturing processes are highly complex and potentially vulnerable to disruptions or inefficient implementation of production changes that can significantly increase our costs and delay product shipments to our customers.\nSome of our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously being modified or maintained in an effort to improve yields and product performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields, interrupt production, result in losses of products in process and harm our reputation. We may from time to time experience bottlenecks and production difficulties that could lead to delivery delays and quality control problems. Such incidents, if they occur, could increase our costs and delay shipments to our customers.\nFurthermore, we have limited experience in establishing, supervising and conducting commercial manufacturing. If we or the third-party manufacturers of our products fail to adequately establish, supervise and conduct all aspects of the manufacturing processes, we may not be able to continue to commercialize our products. While we currently believe we have established sufficient production capacity to supply potential near term demand for our Fuse\u00ae system, we will likely need to scale up and increase our manufacturing capabilities in the future. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully scale up our manufacturing capabilities or that we will have sufficient financial or technical resources to do so on a timely basis or at all.\nOur international operations subject us to regulatory and legal risks and certain operating risks, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe sale and shipment of our Fuse\u00ae system and other products across international borders, the purchase of components from international sources, and our ownership and use of our manufacturing facilities in Germany and Israel subject us to U.S. and foreign governmental trade, import and export, and customs regulations and laws. Compliance with these regulations and laws is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance.\nOther laws and regulations that can significantly impact us include various anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA, as well as export control laws and economic sanctions laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities and exclusion or debarment from government contracting.\nOur international operations expose us and our distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\na shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors;\n\u2022\nthird-party reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who undergo procedures using our products or who use our services to directly absorb costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our products;\n\u2022\ncompetitive disadvantage to competitors who have more established business and customer relationships;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights against infringers, either our own intellectual property rights or those of our distributors or third party suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in defending against allegations of infringement or other intellectual property claims by third-parties against us, our distributors, or any of our third-party suppliers;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied intellectual property rights available in some countries;\n\u2022\neconomic instability of certain countries;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of an FDA inspection that results in adverse findings at our facilities, or the facilities of our vendors or suppliers, and any resulting import detention that prevents products made in such facilities from entering the United States;\n\u2022\nscrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nthe ability of a foreign government to exclude us from, or limit our ability to compete in, the markets under its jurisdiction through collective tender processes or otherwise;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles for products sold to customers outside the U.S.;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of U.S. or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity; and\n\u2022\nthe imposition of new trade restrictions.\nIf we experience any of these events, our sales in non-U.S. jurisdictions or our ability to manufacture our products in non-U.S. jurisdictions may be harmed and our business, results of operations and financial condition would suffer.\nProduct quality issues or product defects may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our medical device products are highly complex and incorporate sophisticated technology, including hardware and software. Software typically contains, particularly in the periods subsequent to the initial launch, bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the device\u2019s operation. Our product development and quality assurance testing programs may not be adequate to detect all defects, which might impact the reliability of our products, negatively impact customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, harm our marketplace reputation, increase warranty repairs or reduce gross margins. In the past, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped, including shipments of our Fuse\u00ae system. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the financial failure of products, a product recall, temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product from a market, damage to our reputation or our brand, inventory costs or product reengineering, repair and obsolescence expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. This risk exists even if a device or product is cleared or approved for commercial sale by FDA or other foreign regulators and manufactured in facilities registered with and regulated by FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Any manufacturing or design defects, misuse (including inadequate sterilization) or abuse associated with our products or our product candidates could result in patient injury or death. The medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims, and we cannot offer any assurance that we will not face product liability suits.\nIn addition, an injury that is caused by the activities of our suppliers, such as those who provide us with components and raw materials, may be the basis for a claim against us. Product liability claims may be brought against us by patients, health care providers or others coming into contact with our products or product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, or if we or our suppliers have inadequate product liability insurance, we may incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nimpairment of our brand or business reputation;\n\u2022\ncostly litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our products or, if approved, our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products or, if approved, our product candidates;\n\u2022\nproduct recall or withdrawal from the market;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants; and\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants.\nWhile we may attempt to manage our product liability exposure by proactively recalling or withdrawing from the market any defective products, any recall or market withdrawal of our products may result in material costs, delay the supply of those products to our customers, and may negatively impact our reputation. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in initiating appropriate recall or market withdrawal efforts that may be required in the future or that these efforts will have the intended effect of preventing product malfunctions and the accompanying product liability that may result. Any such recalls and market withdrawals may also be used by our competitors to harm our reputation for safety or be perceived by patients as a safety risk when considering the use of our products, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we have, and intend to maintain, liability insurance, the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court recently declined to hear an appeal of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruling that the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act did not preempt state laws in a product liability case involving a medical device company. If other courts in the United States adopt similar rulings, we may be subject to increased litigation risk in connection with our products. Product liability claims could negatively affect our reputation, continued product sales, and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products.\nConcerns raised by FDA regarding duodenoscope reprocessing and multidrug-resistant bacterial infections may affect our marketing and manufacturing efforts related to our endoscopes and other GI products.\nFDA has issued a safety communication that the complex design of a certain type of endoscope, specifically ERCP-type endoscopes (also called duodenoscopes), may impede effective reprocessing. Reprocessing is a detailed, multistep process to clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable devices. The FDA safety communication notes that recent medical publications and adverse event reports associate multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in patients who have undergone procedures with reprocessed duodenoscopes, even when manufacturer reprocessing instructions are followed correctly. In addition, the FDA subsequently issued warning letters to Olympus, Fujifilm and Pentax concerning the manufacture and reprocessing of duodenoscopes.\nWhile we do not currently manufacture or sell duodenoscopes, we may develop and market such products in the future. The occurrences noted in the FDA safety communication and warning letters could affect our marketing efforts for our endoscopes, including our gastroscopes and colonoscopes, or result in regulatory restrictions on all endoscopes that may increase our design and manufacturing costs, or make it more difficult to obtain or may delay required regulatory approvals or clearances for new products or modifications to, or enhancements of, our existing products. Any regulatory restrictions or delays could impact the launch of new products or enhancements, our customer satisfaction and the rate of adoption of Fuse\u00ae. The occurrences noted in the FDA safety communication may also present broader issues related to infection control products generally, which we also currently manufacture and market.\nOur costs could substantially increase if we experience a significant number of warranty claims.\nWe provide limited product warranties against manufacturing defects of our endoscopes. Our product warranty requires us to repair defects arising from product design and production processes, and if necessary, replace defective components. The future costs associated with our warranty claims are uncertain due to the relatively recent launch of Fuse\u00ae. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we incurred a warranty charge of $1.1 million as a result of our voluntary decision to replace older endoscopes at several customers.\nIf we experience warranty claims in excess of our expectations, or if our repair and replacement costs associated with warranty claims increase significantly, we will incur liabilities for potential warranty claims that may be greater than we expect. An increase in the frequency of warranty claims or amount of warranty costs may harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are required to maintain high levels of inventory, which could consume a significant amount of our resources, reduce our cash flow and lead to inventory impairment charges.\nAs a result of the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory, we are subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence and expiration, which may lead to inventory impairment charges. In order to market and sell our Fuse\u00ae system effectively, we must maintain high levels of inventory and demonstration equipment. Our manufacturing processes and sourcing processes require lengthy lead times, during which components of our products may become obsolete due to design changes, and we may over-or under-estimate the amount needed of a given component, in which case we may expend extra resources or be constrained in the amount of end product that we can produce. Our dependence on third-party suppliers for our single use products exposes us to greater lead times, increasing our risk of inventory obsolesce comparatively. Furthermore, some of our products have a limited shelf life due to sterilization requirements or degradation, and part or all of a given product or component may expire and its value become impaired. In that instance, we would be required to record an impairment charge. If our estimates of required inventory are too high, we may be exposed to further inventory obsolesce risk. In the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete or expires, or in the event we experience a supply chain imbalance as described above, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory.\nWe are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe generate revenue and incur expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, a majority of which are denominated in Euros and NIS (shekels). As a result, changes in the exchange rates between such foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact the reporting of our receivables and payables in non-U.S. currencies. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it may be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors.\nIn the future, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income and taxes may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and other tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to offset future taxable income and taxes. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year period. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the NOL carryforwards before they expire. We performed a Section 382 and 383 analysis and determined that we had an ownership change, as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, which occurred in 2013 in connection with our acquisition of Peer Medical Ltd. and related equity financing. As a result of this ownership change, we determined that $12.7 million of our federal NOL carryforwards, which totaled approximately $124.8 million as of December 31, 2015, may be subject to a potential limitation. Other transactions that may occur in the future, some of which could be outside of our control, may trigger additional ownership changes pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, which could further limit the NOL carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income, if any. If we are limited in our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and tax credits in future years in which we have taxable income, we will pay more taxes than if we were able to fully utilize our NOL carryforwards and tax credits. This could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party distributors to effectively distribute our products outside the United States.\nWe depend on medical device distributors for the marketing and selling of most our products in certain territories in Europe, Asia, Australia, South Africa and Latin America. These distributors typically sell a variety of other, non-competing products that may limit the resources they dedicate to selling our products. In addition, we are unable to ensure that our distributors comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell our products, in full compliance with applicable laws, our results of operations and business may suffer. Recruiting and retaining qualified third-party distributors and training them in our technology and product offering requires significant time and resources. To develop and expand our distribution, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our distributors. Furthermore, if our distributors fail to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we may suffer reputational harm and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nIf we fail to retain our key executives or recruit and hire new employees, our operations and financial results may be adversely affected while we attract other highly qualified personnel.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to retain our executive officers and other key employees, certain of which have been employees since our inception, and to recruit and hire new employees. The replacement of any of our executive officers and key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany executive officers and employees in the medical device industry are subject to strict non-compete or confidentiality agreements with their employers, which would limit our ability to recruit them to join our company. In addition, some of our existing and future employees are or may be subject to confidentiality agreements with previous employers. Our competitors may allege breaches of and seek to enforce such non-compete agreements or initiate litigation based on such confidentiality agreements. Such litigation, whether or not meritorious, may impede our ability to hire executive officers and other key employees who have been employed by our competitors and may result in intellectual property or tortious interference with contract claims against us.\nIf any of our facilities or the facility of a supplier become inoperable, we will be unable to continue to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our products and, as a result, our business will be harmed until we or the supplier are able to secure a new facility. In addition, key components of our Fuse\u00ae system are manufactured in Israel which may subject our company to greater geopolitical risks.\nWe operate multiple facilities, at which we perform our manufacturing, research and development, clinical pathology services and our other business functions. Our operations and the operations of our distributors and suppliers are conducted in various countries throughout the world, certain of which are conducted in geographies that face acute regional risks and challenges. Such risks and challenges could disrupt our business or the operations of our distributors and suppliers and such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, much of our research and development and a portion of our manufacturing activity is conducted in a single facility located in Israel. Political, economic, and military conditions in Israel may therefore have a direct influence on us. Our operations could be adversely affected by current hostilities involving Israel and the Hamas, a U.S. State Department designated foreign terrorist organization. The interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, may disrupt the research and development and manufacturing activity at our facility there. In addition, some countries, companies and organizations continue to participate in a boycott of Israeli firms, firms with Israeli operations and connections and others doing business with Israel or with Israeli companies. Also, over the past several years there have been calls in Europe and elsewhere to reduce trade with Israel. There can be no assurance that restrictive laws, policies or practices directed towards Israel, Israeli businesses or others doing business with Israel or with Israeli companies will not have an adverse impact on our business. Any terrorist attacks or hostilities related to Israel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur facilities and equipment would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. These facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including, but not limited to, war, terrorist activities, earthquakes, flooding, fire and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to conduct our business for some period of time. Our inability to perform those activities may result in delays in or discontinuances of developing and selling our products during such periods and the loss of customers or harm to our reputation. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and there can be no assurance this insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe obtain our Bonastent\u00ae product through an exclusive distribution agreement that subjects us to minimum performance requirements and other criteria. Our failure to satisfy those criteria could cause us to lose exclusive rights of distribution.\nWe have entered into exclusive distribution agreements with the manufacturer of our Bonastent\u00ae product.\nThe manufacturer brands its products according to our specifications, and we may have exclusive rights in certain fields of use and territories to sell these products subject to minimum purchase or other performance criteria. Although these products do not individually or in the aggregate represent a material portion of our business, if we do not meet these performance criteria, or if we fail to renew these agreements, we may lose exclusivity in a field of use or territory or cease to have any rights to these products, which could have an adverse effect on our sales and our business. Furthermore, our manufacturer is a smaller company that may not have sufficient resources to continue operations or to continue to supply us sufficient product without additional access to capital.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and third-party cloud based systems, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing and distribution. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, phishing scams, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent breakdowns in our information technology and telephone systems, if our systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nWe maintain highly sensitive information related to our business and customers on our information systems, such as:\n\u2022\npersonal identifiable information;\n\u2022\nprotected health information;\n\u2022\ncustomer and patient financial information;\n\u2022\ncompany trade secrets; and\n\u2022\nproduct design plans and specifications.\nWe and our customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in our systems. It could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. In addition, any such failure, problem or breach could harm our reputation, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nIt is difficult and expensive to protect our intellectual property rights and we cannot ensure that they will prevent third parties from competing against us.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products, product candidates and related technologies in both the United States and other countries, successfully defend our intellectual property rights against third-party challenges and successfully enforce our intellectual property rights to prevent third-party infringement. We rely primarily upon a combination of patents, trademarks and trade secret protection, as well as nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions in our consulting, employment and other agreements to protect our brands, products and other proprietary technologies.\nOur ability to protect any of our products and technologies from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part on our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents in both the United States and other countries. Although we actively seek to obtain and maintain patents that cover our products, we may be unsuccessful in obtaining and maintaining patents that cover specific products or aspects of such products. For example, although we have obtained the issuance of a patent in the United States and in four European countries relating to various aspects of our Fuse\u00ae system as currently marketed, we may not be able to obtain any additional patents that would cover similar or different aspects of our Fuse\u00ae system as marketed now or in the future. We are actively prosecuting pending patent applications in the United States covering current and planned embodiments of our Fuse\u00ae system. A majority of our filed patent applications directed toward such technology have not yet been examined and do not yet have an assessment of patentability from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. However, in the course of prosecuting five of our currently pending patent applications covering such technology, we have received Final Rejections from the USPTO on prior art grounds. In response, we have filed, or will file, Requests for Continued Examination, in order to continue prosecuting such patent applications, and we are waiting for, or will wait for, further action by the USPTO patent examiner responsible for such patent applications. Although we continue to actively prosecute these patent applications before the USPTO, we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that any patent will ultimately issue. We also cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any other pending patent applications or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, or if any patents are issued, that any such patents will provide us with any meaningful protection or competitive advantage. Even if issued, existing or future patents may be challenged, including with respect to the ownership of them, or narrowed, invalidated, held unenforceable or circumvented, any of which could limit our ability to prevent competitors and other third parties from developing and marketing similar products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our products and technologies. Further, other companies may design around technologies we have patented, licensed or developed. Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection could be reduced. In addition, the patent positions of medical technology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in the patent laws, implementing regulations or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our patent rights. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPatent applications are generally maintained in confidence until publication. In the United States, for example, patent applications are maintained as confidential for up to 18 months after their filing. Similarly, publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries. Consequently, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications on our products or product candidates. There is also no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which could be used by a third party to challenge validity or enforceability of our patents or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application.\nIn addition, even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge any existing or future patent we own or in-license through adversarial proceedings in the issuing offices or in court proceedings, including as a response to any assertion of our patents against them, which could result in the invalidation or unenforceability of some or all of the relevant patent claims. We may be subject to a third party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO. If a third party asserts a substantial new question of patentability against any claim of a United States patent we own or license, the USPTO may grant a request for reexamination, which may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. The adoption of the America Invents Act has established additional opportunities for third parties to invalidate United States patent claims, including inter partes review and post-grant review, on the basis of a lower legal standards than reexamination and with respect to post-grant review, additional grounds. Outside of the United States, patents we own or license may become subject to patent opposition or similar proceedings, which may result in loss of scope of some claims or loss of the entire patent.\nEnforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights, and otherwise participating in adversarial proceedings involving intellectual property is very complex and expensive, may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business and may result in unfavorable outcomes that could adversely affect our ability to prevent third parties from competing with us. If any of our patents are challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties, and if we do not own or have exclusive rights to other enforceable patents protecting our products or other technologies, competitors and other third parties could market products and use processes that are substantially similar to, or superior to, ours and our business, results of operations and financial condition would suffer.\nOur patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including Europe, China, and Japan. The scope of coverage provided by these patents varies from country to country. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not provide intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining, protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and other technological advances, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect and enforce. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and proprietary information and invention assignment agreements with certain employees, consultants and advisors, third parties may still obtain this information or we may be unable to protect our rights. We also have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our collaborators and suppliers. There can be no assurance that binding agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets and unpatented know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. If trade secrets are independently discovered, we would not be able to prevent their use. In addition, FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, is currently considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how FDA\u2019s disclosure policies may change in the future, if at all. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or unpatented know-how is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secret information. Failure to obtain, or maintain, trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.\nWe also rely on the trademarks we own or license to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors. We cannot guarantee that any trademark applications filed by us will be approved. Third parties may also oppose such trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that the trademarks we use are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot provide any assurance that competitors will not infringe or otherwise violate the trademarks we use, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce these trademarks.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringing or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. The market for medical devices is subject to rapid technological change and substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use, and sell our products. Numerous third-party patents exist in the fields relating to our products. It is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify all third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our products and technologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Moreover, because some patent applications are maintained as confidential until the patents publish, we cannot be certain that third parties have not filed patent applications that cover our products and technologies. Third parties may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our products or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies.\nWe are party to, and may in the future be party to, or threatened with, litigation with third parties, including non-practicing entities, who allege that our products, components of our products and/or proprietary technologies infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. Further, as the number of participants in the industry grows, the possibility of intellectual property infringement claims against us increases. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. If a court determined that we infringe or otherwise violate a third party\u2019s patent or other intellectual property rights, we could be ordered to stop our activities covered by the patents or other intellectual property rights, either permanently or until the conclusion of a trial on the merits, which may not happen for a prolonged period of time. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents or other intellectual property rights. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf a third party claims that we infringe or otherwise violate its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product or technology at issue infringes or violates the third party\u2019s rights, and if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the third party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees;\n\u2022\na court prohibiting us from selling, making, using, exporting or licensing the product or technology unless the third party licenses its intellectual property rights to us, which it is not required to do, on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees and/or grant cross-licenses to obtain intellectual property rights for our products and technology;\n\u2022\nredesigning our products and technology so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time; and/or\n\u2022\nfinding alternative suppliers for infringing products and technologies, which could be costly and create significant delay due to the need for FDA regulatory clearance.\nAt any given time, we may be involved as a defendant in a number of intellectual property infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for a prolonged period of time. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity, adversely impact prospective customers, cause product shipment delays, or prohibit us from manufacturing, marketing or otherwise commercializing our products and technology. Any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn June 16, 2015, Medigus Limited filed a lawsuit against the company in U.S. District Court in Delaware alleging that our Fuse\u00ae full spectrum endoscopy system infringes on a patent owned by Medigus Limited (U.S. Patent No. 6,997,871), or the Medigus Limited Patent. The Medigus Limited Patent requires a specific configuration for objective lenses (which could be cameras or other objective lenses of optical channels) utilized as part of an endoscope that we do not believe is characteristic of the Fuse\u00ae system and, therefore, we believe the technology utilized in Fuse\u00ae clearly falls outside of the claims of the Medigus Limited Patent. Accordingly, we and our counsel believe that Medigus Limited\u2019s assertions are without merit and intend to vigorously defend any claims or suits brought against us related to the Medigus Limited Patent. We have concluded that a material loss from this matter is remote and, therefore, have not recorded a loss reserve. In addition, we maintain an insurance policy to cover certain costs and damages related to assertions of intellectual property infringement against our Fuse\u00ae endoscope system.\nIn addition, we may indemnify our customers and distributors against claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties related to our products. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers or distributors. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers, suppliers or distributors, or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to enforce our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property rights or those of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. We currently do not carry intellectual property insurance that would cover such claims. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent we own is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. A third-party defendant may also request reexamination or inter partes review by the USPTO of any patent we assert, or post grant review in certain instances. An adverse result in any litigation or adversarial proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nAn unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our suppliers, misappropriation of intellectual property rights important to our business, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patent rights and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patent rights or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our products.\nLitigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our existing and future products.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation, and switched the United States patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The USPTO has issued new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, only became effective within the last year. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement and defense of our patents and applications.\nFurthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by United States and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent applications and our ability to obtain additional patent protection in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on our owned and in-licensed patents are due to be paid to governmental patent agencies over the lifetime of the patents. Future maintenance fees will also need to be paid on other patents which may be issued to us. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ outside firms to remind us or our licensor to pay annuity fees due to patent agencies on our patents and pending patent applications. In certain cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. We generally apply for patents in the U.S., and, for certain inventions we deem particularly important or valuable, in certain major markets where it would be commercially infeasible for a competitor to commercialize a product without the ability to sell in such markets. However, we may not accurately predict all the countries where patent protection would ultimately be desirable. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country or major market, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries, and the breadth of patent claims allowed can be inconsistent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories in which we have patent protection that may not be sufficient to terminate infringing activities.\nWe do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist. Moreover, in foreign jurisdictions where we do have patent rights, proceedings to enforce such rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, such proceedings could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products that are the same as or similar to our products, and our competitive position in the international market would be harmed.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nWe could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers or competitors. Although we have procedures in place that seek to prevent our employees from using the proprietary information, know-how, trade secrets and other intellectual property of others in their work for us, we may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement, or that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information or other intellectual property of a former employer or competitor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets, proprietary information or other intellectual property of the former employers. An inability to incorporate technologies or features that are important or essential to our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, and may prevent us from selling our products. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Moreover, any such litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks or names. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build name recognition with potential customers in our markets of interest. In addition, third parties have registered trademarks similar and identical to our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions, and may in the future file for registration of such trademarks. If they succeed in registering or developing common law rights in such trademarks, and if we were not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to market our products in those countries. In any case, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nIn addition to patents and trademark protection, we rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our consultants and vendors or our former employees. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, however, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our trade secrets and other unpatented or unregistered proprietary information, and once disclosed, we are likely to lose trade secret protection. Monitoring unauthorized use and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breach. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts outside of the United States are less willing or unwilling to enforce trade secret protection.\nFurther, our competitors may independently develop knowledge, methods and know-how similar, equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology, or develop their own competitive products that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. In addition, our key employees, consultants, suppliers or other individuals with access to our proprietary technology and know-how may incorporate that technology and know-how into projects and inventions developed independently or with third parties. As a result, disputes may arise regarding the ownership of the proprietary rights to such technology or know-how, and any such dispute may not be resolved in our favor. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using the technology or information to compete with us and our competitive position could be adversely affected. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected so as to protect our market against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nOthers may be able to develop products that are similar to our products or product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own.\n\u2022\nWe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022\nWe might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u2022\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022\nIt is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents.\n\u2022\nIssued patents that we own may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u2022\nWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\n\u2022\nThe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks related to regulation of our industry\nOur products are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and our failure or our suppliers\u2019 failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nThe medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities, principally FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies and authorities, such as the EU bodies and authorities, EU Member State Competent Authorities and the EEA Member State Competent Authorities. FDA and other U.S., EU, EEA and foreign governmental agencies and authorities regulate and oversee, among other things, with respect to medical devices:\n\u2022\ndesign, development and manufacturing;\n\u2022\ntesting, labeling, and content and language of instructions for use and storage;\n\u2022\nclinical trials;\n\u2022\nproduct safety and effectiveness;\n\u2022\nmarketing, sales and distribution;\n\u2022\npre-market regulatory clearance and approval;\n\u2022\nconformity assessment procedures;\n\u2022\nrecord-keeping procedures;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promotion;\n\u2022\nrecalls and field safety corrective actions;\n\u2022\npost-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could cause or contribute to death or serious injury;\n\u2022\npost-market studies; and\n\u2022\nproduct import and export.\nThe laws and regulations to which we and our suppliers are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Legislative or regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, difficulties in developing or commercializing new products, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales.\nOur failure or our suppliers\u2019 failure to comply with U.S. federal and state regulations or EU or EEA or other foreign regulations applicable in the countries where we operate could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, the imposition of injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory clearance or approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. In the most extreme cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities may occur. If any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur products are also subject to extensive governmental regulation in foreign jurisdictions, such as Europe, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\nIn the EU and the EEA, our Fuse\u00ae system and our other products must comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE Mark to a product, without which a product cannot be marketed or sold in the EU and the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE Mark to our products, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue a CE Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by a competent authority of an EU or an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would audit and examine the Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our products. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE Mark to its medical products after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.\nAs a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical products and their manufacturers with the Essential Requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use and that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from (1) clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed, (2) scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or (3) both clinical studies and scientific literature. The conduct of clinical studies in the EU and the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These may include the requirement of prior authorization by the competent authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent ethics committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming.\nIn order to continue to sell our Fuse\u00ae system and our other products in Europe, we must maintain our CE Mark and continue to comply with certain EU Directives. Our failure to continue to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, including those administered by authorities of the EU and EEA countries, could result in enforcement actions against us, including refusal, suspension or withdrawal of our CE Certificates of Conformity by our Notified Body (either the British Standards Institution, or BSI, or MEDCERT (in the case of our Fuse\u00ae system)), which could impair our ability to market products in the EEA in the future.\nIf we materially modify our approved products, we may be required to seek and obtain new approvals or clearances, which, if not granted, would prevent us from selling our modified products.\nA component of our strategy is to continually modify and upgrade our products. FDA requires companies to obtain a new clearance (or approval) if a modification(s) to a medical device could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device. Also, medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. We may be unable to obtain additional regulatory clearances or approvals for modifications to, or additional indications for, our existing products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Fuse\u00ae system and our other products may in the future be subject to recalls or market withdrawals that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFDA, EU and EEA Competent Authorities and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could affect patient safety. In the case of FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. We may, under our own initiative, recall a product if a deficiency in our products is found. FDA requires that recalls be reported to FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated if the recall was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our international distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. One specific issue that could lead to a recall, or other FDA enforcement action, is inadequate sterilization by users leading to infection, or an FDA determination that our validation of the cleaning, disinfection or sterilization procedures, or instructions to healthcare facilities for conducting these activities, for our Fuse\u00ae System are inadequate. Recalls, which could include certain notifications and other corrections as well as removals, of our Fuse\u00ae system or our other products, could divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, harm our reputation with customers, and reduce our ability to achieve expected revenue.\nWe may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs, or be required to take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of FDA. If FDA disagrees with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIn addition, the manufacturing of our products is subject to extensive post-market regulation by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, and any failure by us or our suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements could result in recalls, facility closures, and other penalties. We and our suppliers and contract manufacturers are subject to QSR and comparable foreign regulations which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, shipping, installation and servicing of medical devices. These regulations are enforced through periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements at our or our suppliers\u2019 or contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities may result in warning or untitled letters, manufacturing restrictions, voluntary or mandatory recalls, fines, withdrawals of regulatory clearances or approvals, product seizures, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in treatment guidelines or medical standards of care, particularly with regard to the prevention of bacterial infection, may require us to redesign or seek new or additional marketing authorizations from FDA for our products and product candidates.\nTreatment guidelines and standards of care are subject to continual revision and evolution as additional information about the treatment and spread of disease becomes available to the scientific community. If these guidelines or standards of care change, we may be required to redesign or seek new or additional marketing authorizations for our products and product candidates. In particular, changes in the treatment guidelines and standards of care for infection control could result in our current suite of infection control products no longer satisfying standards set forth by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. We may not be able to redesign our products and product candidates, and we may not be able to obtain any additional required authorizations, to comply with any updated treatment guidelines and standards of care, and our efforts to comply with these updated treatment guidelines and standards of care could create substantial costs for our business. Even if we are able to complete such redesigns and obtain any additional required approvals, we may not be successful in marketing these redesigned products and product candidates. If any of these events occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely effected.\nWe are required to report certain malfunctions, deaths and serious injuries associated with our products, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder FDA medical device reporting (\"MDR\") regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to submit information to FDA when they become aware of information that reasonably suggests a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned, and, upon recurrence, the malfunction would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. If we determine that an MDR report is not required to be submitted for an event, and FDA disagrees with that determination, it could take enforcement action against us for failing to report the event. All manufacturers marketing medical devices in the EU and EEA are legally bound to report incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the regulatory agency, or competent authority, in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. Under Directive 93/42/EEC concerning Medical Devices, or the EU Medical Devices Directive, an incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health.\nMalfunction or misuse of our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls, including corrections (e.g., customer notifications), or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement actions. If malfunctions or misuse do occur, we may be unable to correct the malfunctions adequately or prevent further malfunctions or misuse, in which case we may need to cease manufacture and distribution of the affected products, initiate voluntary recalls, and redesign the products or the instructions for use for those products. Regulatory authorities may also take actions against us, such as ordering recalls, imposing fines, or seizing the affected products. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, may distract management from operating our business, and may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe off-label promotion of our products could result in costly investigations and sanctions from FDA and other regulatory bodies.\nOur products have been cleared by FDA, CE Marked in the EU and EEA and approved by Australia\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration for specific indications. We may only promote or market our products for their specifically cleared or approved indications. We train our marketing and sales force against promoting our products for uses outside of the cleared or approved indications for use, known as \u201coff-label uses.\u201d\nIf FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of unsupported claims or an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment of our operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EU laws and EEA Member States laws implementing the EU Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU and EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. EU and EEA Member State legislation may also restrict or impose limitations on our ability to advertise our products directly to the general public. In addition, voluntary EU and national Codes of Conduct provide guidelines on the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals harming our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, and a finding of failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and other regulation and enforcement by federal, state and foreign governments, which could significantly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the United States, the laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and regulations, which prohibit, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration (directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, overtly or covertly) to other individuals or entities in exchange for, or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, or arrangement for or recommendation of the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Courts have held that the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be violated if even one purpose of the payment or offer of remuneration is to make an improper inducement, even if the primary purpose or purposes of the arrangement are legitimate. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute and violations can result in imprisonment and/or exclusions from participation in federal healthcare programs, as well as monetary penalties and fines. Further, the ACA amends the intent requirements of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. Under the revised statutes, person or entity can now be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The Civil False Claims Act includes whistleblower provisions that allow independent parties to raise allegations of false claims on behalf of the federal government. Whistleblowers who bring successful claims are eligible to receive up to twenty-five percent of the government\u2019s recovery in the matter. There has been a substantial increase in recent years of the number of whistleblower actions being brought within the life sciences and healthcare industries;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. A person or entity does not need actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers must submit reports for each calendar year by the 90th day of the subsequent calendar year;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits, among other things, physicians (and their family members) who have a financial relationship, including an investment, ownership or compensation relationship with an entity, from referring Medicare patients for designated health services, which include clinical pathology services furnished by the company, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. In addition, a number of courts have allowed Stark Law enforcement actions to be brought with respect to Medicaid services. Claims submitted in violation of this prohibition may also be found to violate the federal false claims acts. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all third-party payors, not just Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections; and\n\u2022\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require medical device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nMany states also license the manufacture, storage, shipping, or sale of medical devices. Our ability to legally manufacturer, store, ship, or sell our products is dependent upon maintenance of appropriate licenses and permits. The requirements for these licenses and permits are often subject to the purview of state licensing boards, and the decisions and interpretations of these boards can change without notice.\nMoreover, while we do not generally submit claims and our GI department customers make the ultimate decision on how to submit claims, except with respect to our pathology services, we may from time-to-time provide reimbursement guidance to our GI department customers. If a government authority were to conclude that we provided improper advice to our GI department customers or encouraged the submission of false claims for reimbursement, we could face action against us by government authorities. Any violations of these laws, or any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between medical device companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of the settlement of these investigations in order to avoid potential prosecution or exclusion, companies may be required to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCompliance with the HIPAA security regulations and privacy regulations may increase our costs.\nWe maintain protected health information of patients through our clinical pathology services and potentially through the use of our Fuse\u00ae system. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:\n\u2022\nthe circumstances under which the use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services, and other business activities integral to running our business, known as healthcare operations;\n\u2022\na patient\u2019s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information as well as a new right of access to laboratory test reports under the HIPAA Privacy Rule which preempts a number of state laws that prohibit a laboratory from releasing a test report directly to the individual, for which compliance was required by October 4, 2014;\n\u2022\nthe content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information;\n\u2022\nadministrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and\n\u2022\nthe protection of computing systems maintaining electronic protected health information, or ePHI.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, as required by law. The privacy and security regulations establish a \u201cfloor\u201d and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, we may be required to comply with the laws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or health care operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. Due to the enactment of HITECH, it is not possible to predict the impact on our business; however, if we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information we could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. In addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. For example, we could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. Finally, we may be required to incur additional costs related to ongoing HIPAA compliance as may be necessary to address evolving interpretations and enforcement of HIPAA and other health information privacy and security laws, the enactment of new laws or regulations, emerging cybersecurity threats and other factors.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reform measures may have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by FDA and such actions may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times for our product candidates. Delays in receipt of, or failure to receive, regulatory approvals for our product candidates would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which includes a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, effective January 1, 2013. This excise tax resulted in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry. In December 2015, Congress passed legislation that included at two-year suspension of the tax. If the tax is resumed and if any efforts we undertake to offset the excise tax are unsuccessful as we begin to sell the product in the United States, the increased tax burden could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Other elements of the ACA, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots and other provisions, may significantly affect the payment for, and the availability of, healthcare services and result in fundamental changes to federal healthcare reimbursement programs, any of which may materially affect numerous aspects of our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, was signed into law which further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, including hospitals.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products and services or additional pricing pressures.\nFailure to comply with the FCPA and similar laws associated with any activities outside the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA and other anti-bribery legislation around the world. The FCPA generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments, offers or promises to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other advantages. In addition, the FCPA imposes recordkeeping and internal control requirements on publicly traded corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to, among other things, prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. The FCPA expressly applies to conduct by third-party representatives acting on a company\u2019s behalf. We may face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments, offers or promises of payment to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other advantages. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, some of which represent significant potential markets for us, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other laws and regulations. Although we have implemented a company policy requiring our employees, consultants and distributors to comply with the FCPA and similar laws, such policy may not be effective at preventing all potential FCPA or other violations. There can be no assurance that our employees, agents or distributors will not take actions that violate our policies or applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As a result of our focus on managing our growth, our development of infrastructure designed to identify FCPA matters and monitor compliance is at an early stage. Any violation of the FCPA and related policies could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur pathology business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under applicable laws and regulations.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. CLIA extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. In addition, our pathology laboratories are subject to regulation under state law. State laws may require that laboratories or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records.\nApplicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, or product suspensions or recalls which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were found to be out of compliance with any material license or permit requirement, it could have a material effect on our operations and a material adverse effect on our business. Finally, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly.\nFailure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act and the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious waste and hazardous waste and materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. Our GI pathology laboratory is subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens. In addition, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. In addition, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act requires that we include in our safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace.\nFailure to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us which may be costly.\nNew regulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, to establish new disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that use certain minerals and metals mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals, in their products whether or not these products or the components containing such conflict minerals are manufactured by third parties. The new rule may affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.\nSince our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to verify the origins for these minerals used in our products sufficiently through the due diligence procedures that we implement; therefore, we may be prevented from certifying our products as conflict-free, which may harm our reputation. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\nRisks related to our financial position and capital requirements\nWe may require additional funding.\nWe believe that our existing cash and our borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2018. We have based this estimate, however, on assumptions that may prove incorrect, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect.\nThe amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of revenue from sales of our products and services, including our Fuse\u00ae system;\n\u2022\nthe amount we invest to commercialize our Fuse\u00ae system;\n\u2022\nthe timing, rate of progress and other product development activities for our products;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with expanding our sales force and marketing programs to support increased sales of our products;\n\u2022\nthe amount we invest to expand our manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022\nwhether, and for what amount, we acquire other businesses, products and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire or in-license products and product candidates, technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\ncosts of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our products and product candidates;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with prosecuting or defending any litigation that we are or may become involved in, and any damages payable by us that result from such litigation;\n\u2022\ncosts of operating as a public company;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\ncosts of complying with existing or future regulations;\n\u2022\nadditional personnel, facility and equipment requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any additional collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to fund our operating deficits and working capital needs, to pay down debt or to fund acquisitions. We may also need to raise additional funds to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, receivables or royalty financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, our stockholders ownership will be diluted. We may raise additional capital in the future, even if not necessary, based on market conditions.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to expand our R&D, manufacturing operations and sales and marketing efforts, which may significantly delay, scale back or discontinue aspects of our business plan. We also may be required to relinquish, license or otherwise dispose of rights to products or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to commercialize or develop ourselves on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available. In addition, our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations.\nOn June 30, 2015, we refinanced our outstanding indebtedness by entering into a term loan credit and security agreement and a revolving loan credit and security agreement (together, the \u201cCredit Agreements\u201d). As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $43 million of total indebtedness, net of discount, outstanding under these Credit Agreements.\nOur outstanding debt and related debt service obligations could have important adverse consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nheightening our vulnerability to downturns in our business or our industry or the general economy and restricting us from making acquisitions, or exploring business opportunities;\n\u2022\nrequiring a significant portion of our available cash to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our available cash to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have greater capital resources; and\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, with which our failure to comply could result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument that allows the lender to demand immediate repayment of the related debt.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay product development, sales and marketing, capital and other expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nThe Credit Agreements contain representations and covenants, including financial covenants that the Company must maintain certain specified levels of liquidity and net revenues. Our obligations to maintain these liquidity and net revenues measures may impair our ability to fund our operations or invest in new operations that could help grow our business.\nThe Credit Agreements also contain customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, covenant defaults, breaches of certain representations and warranties, cross defaults to certain material indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, certain events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1973, or ERISA, material judgments, and a change of control. If an event of default occurs and is not cured within any applicable grace period or is not waived, the administrative agent and the lenders are entitled to take various actions, including, without limitation, the acceleration of amounts due under the agreements, termination of commitments under the Credit Agreements and realization upon the collateral securing the credit facilities. Any of these actions could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition.\nA significant increase in our days sales outstanding could increase bad debt expense and have an adverse effect on our business including its cash flow.\nBilling for clinical pathology services is a complex process. We bill many different payors including doctors, patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. In addition to billing complexities, we are experiencing increasing patient responsibility as a result of managed care fee-for-service plans, which continue to increase patient copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. A material increase in our days sales outstanding level resulting in an increase in our bad debt expense could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including cash flows.\nOur results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn.\nOur results of operations and liquidity could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Domestic and international equity and debt markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, heightened volatility and turmoil based on domestic and international economic conditions and concerns. In the event these economic conditions and concerns continue or worsen and the markets continue to remain volatile, our results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways, including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary, and our stock price may decline. If economic instability continues, we cannot provide assurance that you will not experience losses on your investments.\nImpairment charges of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets could negatively impact our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity\nIntangible assets which are separately identified, such as developed technology, customer relationships and other assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. Intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually or between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of an intangible asset or reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount, which could lead to the measurement and recognition of an impairment charge. These risks include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in legal factors or the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a more-likely-than-not expectation that all or a significant portion of a reporting unit may be disposed of, failure to realize anticipated revenues or synergies from acquisitions, a sustained decline in the Company\u2019s market capitalization, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, and lowered expectations of future financial results. The Company has not recorded an impairment of goodwill or any intangible asset in 2015, 2014 and 2013. The Company\u2019s market capitalization has declined since its initial public offering. Further declines in the Company\u2019s market capitalization could increase the risk of a goodwill or intangible asset impairment charge in the future.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and your investment could decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of the value of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nthe success of, and fluctuation in, the sales of our products;\n\u2022\nthe development status of our product candidates and when our products receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nour execution of our sales and marketing, manufacturing and other aspects of our business plan;\n\u2022\nperformance of third parties on whom we rely to manufacture and distribute our products, product components and product candidates, including their ability to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors and the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nour announcement of significant contracts, acquisitions, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of competing products or other initiatives;\n\u2022\nannouncements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n\u2022\nregulatory and reimbursement developments in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\ngeneral domestic and international economic conditions unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies. These broad market factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur principal stockholders have a controlling influence over our business affairs and may make business decisions with which you disagree and which may adversely affect the value of your investment.\nAs of March 16, 2016, our directors and officers, and stockholders who own 5% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, collectively beneficially own approximately 68.2% of our common stock. As a result, if some of these persons or entities act together, they will have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any business combination. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. Some of these persons or entities who make up our principal stockholders may have interests different from yours.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of a substantial amount of our common stock could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we or our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our shares of common stock in the public market or if the market perceives that these sales could occur, the market price of shares of our common stock could decline. These sales may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate, or to use equity as consideration for future acquisitions.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and reduces the amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the SEC.\nThe JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d or EGCs. As defined in the JOBS Act, a public company whose initial public offering of common equity securities occurred after December 8, 2011 and whose annual gross revenues are less than $1.0 billion will, in general, qualify as an EGC until the earliest of:\n\u2022\nthe last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of its initial public offering of common equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe last day of its fiscal year in which it has annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more;\n\u2022\nthe date on which it has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and\n\u2022\nthe date on which it is deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d which will occur at such time as the company (1) has an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700.0 million or more as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (2) has been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1943, or the Exchange Act, for a period of at least 12 months and (3) has filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act.\nUnder this definition, we are an EGC and could remain one until as late as December 31, 2020. For so long as we are an EGC we will, among other things:\n\u2022\nnot be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley;\n\u2022\nnot be required to hold a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation pursuant to Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act;\n\u2022\nnot be required to seek stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved pursuant to Section 14A(b) of the Exchange Act;\n\u2022\nbe exempt from any rule adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplemental auditor discussion and analysis; and\n\u2022\nbe subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This permits an EGC to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nFurthermore, to the extent we take advantage of some or all of the reduced disclosure requirements above, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC, regarding our internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete needed improvements to our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the market price of our common stock and your investment.\nWe are a public reporting company subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Complying with such reporting obligations may place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel.\nIn addition, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting by the time our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2016 is due and thereafter, which will require us to document and make significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at such time as we cease to be an EGC, although, as described in the preceding risk factor, we could potentially qualify as an EGC until December 31, 2020. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nIf our senior management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on management\u2019s assessment and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOperating as a public company creates substantial costs related to compliance and reporting and requires substantial time and attention from our management.\nWe incur substantial legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company. The Dodd-Frank Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. In addition, rules that the SEC is implementing or is required to implement pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to require additional changes. Compliance with these and other similar laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may create substantial expenses, including increased legal and accounting costs. We also expect that these and future laws, rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as officers. Although the JOBS Act may for a limited period of time somewhat lessen the cost of complying with these additional regulatory and other requirements, we nonetheless expect a substantial increase in legal, accounting, insurance and certain other expenses in the future, which will negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur corporate documents and the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of our company even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders. These provisions:\n\u2022\nstagger the terms of our board of directors and require supermajority stockholder voting to remove directors;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of those shares, which may be senior to our common stock, without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominating directors and proposing matters to be voted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent; and\n\u2022\nrequire supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation prohibits large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or consolidating with us except under certain circumstances. These provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, other employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, other employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, other employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently expect to retain all future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and repayment of debt and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, we must comply with the covenants in our Credit Agreements, in order to be able to pay cash dividends, and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.", "PERMNO": 15451, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "GI"}
