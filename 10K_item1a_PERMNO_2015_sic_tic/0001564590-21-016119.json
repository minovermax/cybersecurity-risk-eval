{"cik": "794367", "company": "Macy's, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nIn evaluating the Company, the risks described below and the matters described in \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters are numerous and diverse, may be experienced continuously or intermittently, and may vary in intensity and effect. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in the Company\u2019s securities.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 has had and will continue to have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nIn December 2019, there was an outbreak of COVID-19 in China that has since spread to the other regions of the world. The outbreak was subsequently labeled as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. As the pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States, businesses as well as federal, state and local governments have implemented significant actions to attempt to mitigate this public health crisis. Although the ultimate\nseverity of the COVID-19 outbreak is uncertain at this time, the pandemic has had and will continue to have adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nOn March 18, 2020, the Company temporarily closed all of its stores and subsequently furloughed the majority of its workforce. As different states and localities began to ease the regulations imposed to slow the spread of COVID-19, the Company began to reopen its stores and by the end of the second quarter of 2020, substantially all of the Company\u2019s stores had reopened. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and particularly with the reopening of stores, the Company implemented safety measures and health and wellness precautions across its stores and facilities to mitigate risk to its customers and colleagues. These efforts to protect the health and well-being of customers and Company colleagues have resulted in, and will continue to result in, additional selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses. Recently, pockets of resurgence and variant strains of COVID-19 have emerged in parts of the world and the U.S., which may negatively impact store performance, as consumer shopping behaviors are impacted or government officials reinstate or prolong restrictions that may include occupancy limits, curfews and closures of non-essential businesses. Outbreaks and variant strains of the COVID-19 virus may continue to emerge or grow, which could require the Company to close its stores or further limit their operations. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether stores can remain open or whether further store closures may be required.\n\u2022\nDuring the first and second quarters of 2020, the Company experienced significant reductions and volatility in demand for its retail products as customers were not able to purchase merchandise in stores due to quarantine or government or self-imposed restrictions placed on the Company\u2019s stores\u2019 operations. Despite continued store recovery in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, store sales declined significantly compared to the same periods last year. Additionally, social distancing measures or changes in consumer spending behaviors due to COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact traffic in stores and could result in a loss of sales and profit.\n\u2022\nCOVID-19 has had a significant impact on the economic conditions in North America as well as a significant impact on discretionary consumer spending and consumer shopping behaviors. In response to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company reconfigured its cost base through colleague reductions and reduced discretionary spending and has made investments to adapt to the changes in consumer behavior. While it is premature to accurately predict the ultimate impact of these developments, the Company expects its results of operations will be adversely impacted in a significant manner and such impacts could continue for an undetermined amount of time.\n\u2022\nThe Company has experienced and may continue to experience temporary or long-term disruptions in its supply chain, as the outbreak has resulted in travel disruptions and has impacted manufacturing and distribution throughout the world. The receipt of products or raw material sourced from impacted areas has been and may continue to be slowed or disrupted, which could impact the Company\u2019s private brands or the fulfillment of merchandise orders from the Company\u2019s brand partners. Furthermore, transportation delays and cost increases, more extensive travel restrictions, closures or disruptions of businesses and facilities and social, economic, political or labor instability in the affected areas have impacted and may continue to impact the Company, its suppliers\u2019 operations and its customers.\n\u2022\nThe Company has been and may continue to be required to change its plan for inventory receipts, which could place financial pressure on its brand partners. Such actions may negatively impact relationships with brand partners or adversely impact their financial performance and position. If this occurs, current brand partners\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to the Company may be impacted or the Company may also be required to identify new brand partner relationships.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity was negatively impacted by the store closures. While the Company has obtained additional financing, further actions may be required to improve the Company\u2019s cash position, including but not limited to, monetizing Company assets, reinstituting colleague furloughs, and foregoing capital expenditures and other discretionary expenses. Failure to obtain any necessary additional financing or enhance the Company\u2019s liquidity could lead to default on its current financing arrangements and impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations as they come due.\nThe Company cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can it predict the severity and duration of its impact, how variant strains of the COVID-19 virus will impact the pandemic, or the availability and distribution of effective medical treatments or vaccines. As such, the Company will continue to assess the highly uncertain financial impacts of COVID-19. The disruption to the global economy and to the Company\u2019s\nbusiness may lead to triggering events that may indicate that the carrying value of certain assets, including inventories, long-lived assets, intangibles, and goodwill, may not be recoverable.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks included in in this section, any of which could be material. The situation is changing rapidly, and future impacts may materialize that are not yet known. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the Company may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to the Company's business as a result of the virus' long-term economic impact, including adverse impacts on the business operations, liquidity and impacts of any recession that may occur in the future.\nStrategic, Operational and Competitive Risks\nOur strategic initiatives may not be successful, which could negatively affect our profitability and growth.\nIn February 2020, we announced the Polaris strategy, a multi-year plan designed to stabilize profitability and position the Company for sustainable, profitable growth. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have refined the components of the Polaris strategy to focus where we believe we can drive competitive advantage and differentiation to first recover business and then drive growth, including a focus on winning with fashion and style, delivering clear value, excelling in digital shopping, enhancing store experience, modernizing supply chain and enabling transformation. Our ability to achieve sustainable, profitable growth is subject to the successful implementation of our strategic plans, including the Polaris strategy, and realization of anticipated benefits and savings. If these investments or initiatives do not perform as expected or create implementation or operational challenges, our profitability and growth could suffer.\nOur sales and operating results depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and manage our inventory and merchandise selection.\nThe fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. We develop new retail concepts and continuously adjust our inventory position in certain major and private-label brands and product categories in an effort to attract and retain customers. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to manage inventory levels and merchandise selection. Overestimating customer demand for merchandise will likely result in the need to record inventory markdowns and sell excess inventory at clearance prices, which would negatively impact our gross margins and operating results. Underestimating customer demand for merchandise can lead to inventory shortages, missed sales opportunities and negative customer experiences.\nThe Company faces significant competition and challenges as consumers continue to migrate to online shopping and depends on its ability to differentiate itself in retail's ever-changing environment.\nWe conduct our retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although Macy's, Inc. is one of the nation\u2019s largest retailers, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, manufacturers\u2019 outlets, off-price and discount stores, online retailers and catalogs, among others. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. Any failure by us to compete effectively could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nAs consumers continue to migrate online, a trend that has accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we face pressures to not only compete from a price perspective with our competitors, some of whom sell the same products, but also to differentiate Macy's, Inc. merchandise offerings, service and shopping experience to stay relevant in retail's ever-changing environment. We continue to significantly invest in our omnichannel capabilities to provide our customers with a seamless shopping experience between our store locations and our online and mobile environments and a favorable fashion experience. Insufficient, untimely or misguided investments in this area could significantly impact our profitability and growth and affect our ability to attract new customers, as well as maintain our existing ones.\nIn addition, a continued decline of customer store traffic and migration of sales from brick and mortar stores to digital platforms could lead to additional store closures, restructuring and other costs that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to grow depends in part on our stores remaining relevant to customers.\nWe have invested in facilities and fixtures upgrades, merchandise assortment and customer service in selected stores to improve customer retention rates and overall customer satisfaction. While these investments are intended to improve the customer experience in our stores and drive traffic, realization of these benefits may not occur.\nBecause we rely on the ability of our physical retail locations to remain relevant to customers, providing desirable and sought-out shopping experiences is important to our financial success. Changes in consumer shopping habits, an over-malled/over-retailed environment, financial difficulties at other anchor tenants, significant mall vacancy issues, mall violence and new on- and off-mall developments could each adversely impact the traffic at current retail locations and lead to a decline in our financial condition or performance.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our real estate strategy.\nWe continue to explore opportunities to monetize our real estate portfolio, including sales of stores as well as non-store real estate such as warehouses, outparcels and parking garages. We also continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio to identify opportunities where the redevelopment value of our real estate exceeds the value of non-strategic operating locations. This strategy is multi-pronged and may include transactions, strategic alliances or other arrangements with mall developers or other unrelated third-parties. Due to the cyclical nature of real estate markets, the performance of our real estate strategy is inherently volatile and could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business.\nOur business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the year, which includes the fall and the months of November and December. A disproportionate amount of our revenues is in the fourth quarter due to this seasonality. Should sales during this period fall below our expectations, a disproportionately negative impact on our annual results of operations could occur.\nWe incur significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including costs for additional inventory, advertising and employees. If we are not successful in executing our sales strategy during this period, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees.\nOur business is dependent upon attracting, training, developing and retaining quality employees. Macy's, Inc. has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. Low unemployment and a competitive wage environment have impacted our ability to attract and recruit talent, particularly for science, technology, engineering and math positions. The Company operates in a highly competitive and challenging business environment and is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics. Restructurings and organizational changes can have near-term impacts on knowledge transfer and result in the loss of key subject matter experts and leaders. Any circumstances that adversely impact our ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nIncreases in labor costs and the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.\nMinimum wage increases by states and wage and benefit increases to attract and retain workers in a tight labor market have increased labor costs in the retail sector. These increased costs pressure our margins and could have a negative impact on our financial results, particularly if future increases are instituted by state legislatures or the federal government.\nOur expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could negatively affect our financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, we are not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform will have on our company-sponsored medical plans.\nIf cash flows from our private label credit card decrease, our financial and operational results may be negatively impacted.\nWe previously sold most of our credit accounts and related receivables to Citibank (in its role as the issuer of our credit card). Following the sale, we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with Citibank. Deterioration in economic or political conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in the Company receiving lower payments under the credit card program.\nUnder the terms of the credit card program, Citibank has the right to terminate the agreement prior to the end of the current term if sales decrease by more than 34% over a twelve-month period as compared to the fiscal twelve-month period from July 2006 to June 2007 (the \u201cBenchmark Year\u201d). Based on the results of the Company\u2019s February 2021 fiscal period, sales for the most recent twelve-month period then ended have decreased by more than 34% as compared to the Benchmark Year. We are in on-going discussions with Citibank concerning the credit card program. We cannot assure that Citibank will not terminate the credit card program or require more favorable terms to continue the credit card program. If Citibank does terminate the credit card program, any new credit card program may be on terms less favorable to us than the current credit card program.\nCredit card operations are subject to many federal and state laws that may impose certain requirements and limitations on credit card providers. Citibank and our subsidiary bank, FDS Bank, may be required to comply with regulations that may negatively impact the operation of our private label credit card. This negative impact may affect our revenue streams derived from the sale of such credit card accounts and our financial results.\nOur defined benefit plan funding requirements or plan settlement expense could impact our financial results and cash flow.\nSignificant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and timing and amount of benefit payments could affect the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nThese plans allow eligible retiring employees to receive lump sum distributions of benefits earned. Under applicable accounting rules, if annual lump sum distributions exceed an actuarially determined threshold of the total of the annual service and interest costs, we would be required to recognize in the current period of operations a settlement expense of a portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss and could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIf our company\u2019s reputation and brand are not maintained at a high level, our operations and financial results may suffer.\nWe believe our reputation and brand are partially based on the perception that we act equitably and honestly in dealing with our customers, employees, business partners and shareholders. Our reputation and brand may be deteriorated by any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. Information about us, whether or not true, may be instantly and easily posted on social media platforms at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or brand. The harm could be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. If our reputation or brand is damaged, our customers may refuse to continue shopping with us, potential employees may be unwilling to work for us, business partners may be discouraged from seeking future business dealings with us and, as a result, our operations and financial results may suffer.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our brands and business could be damaged.\nWe believe that our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property are important assets and key elements of our strategy, including those related to our private brand merchandise. We rely on copyright and trademark law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights. If the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights are inadequate, or if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights for any reason, our merchandise brands and business could be negatively affected.\nInfrastructure Risks\nUnforeseen disruptions in our distribution and fulfillment centers could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.\nOur business depends on the orderly receipt and distribution of merchandise and effective management of our distribution and fulfillment centers. Unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss or unavailability of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.\nA material disruption in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Our information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by our employees. If our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, including a material disruption in our ability to authorize and process transactions at our stores or on our online systems, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations. Any material interruption in our information technology systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on our information technology systems, including telecommuting issues associated with our employee population working remotely or an increase in online orders due to disruptions or closures of our retail store operations.\nIf our technology-based e-commerce systems do not function properly, our operating results could be negatively affected.\nCustomers are increasingly using computers, tablets and smart phones to shop online and to do price and comparison shopping. We strive to anticipate and meet our customers\u2019 changing expectations and are focused on building a seamless shopping experience across our omnichannel business. Any failure to provide user-friendly, secure e-commerce platforms that offer merchandise and delivery options that resonate with customers\u2019 could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of online and other sales, harm our reputation with customers and have a material adverse impact on the growth of our business and our operating results.\nInformation Security, Cybersecurity, Privacy and Data Management Risks\nA breach of information technology systems could adversely affect our reputation, business partner and customer relationships and operations, and result in high costs.\nThrough our sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, we collect and store certain non-public personal information that customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on websites, or otherwise communicate to us. This may include phone numbers, driver license numbers, contact preferences, personal information stored on electronic devices, and payment information, including credit and debit card data. We gather and retain information about employees in the normal course of business. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. In addition, our online operations depend upon the transmission of confidential information over the Internet, such as information permitting cashless payments.\nWe employ safeguards for the protection of this information and have made significant investments to secure access to our information technology network. For instance, we have implemented authentication protocols, installed firewalls and anti-virus/anti-malware software, conducted continuous risk assessments, and established data security breach preparedness and response plans. We also employ encryption and other methods to protect our data, promote security awareness with our associates and work with business partners in an effort to create secure and compliant systems.\nHowever, these protections may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, burglaries, cyberattacks, errors by employees or employees of third-party vendors, or contractors, misappropriation of data by\nemployees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularities that may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data.\nRetail data frequently targeted by cybercriminals includes consumer credit card data, personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, and health care information. For retailers, point of sale and e-commerce websites are often attacked through compromised credentials, including those obtained through phishing, vishing and credential stuffing. Other methods of attack include advanced malware, the exploitation of software and operating vulnerabilities, and physical device tampering/skimming at card reader units. We believe these attack methods will continue to evolve.\nDespite instituting controls for the protection of such information, no commercial or government entity can be entirely free of vulnerability to attack or compromise given that the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service change frequently. During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information systems. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception to employees, contractors, vendors and temporary staff. We may be unable to protect the integrity of our systems or company data. An alleged or actual unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure of non-public personal information could:\n\u2022\nmaterially damage our reputation and brand, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information; and\n\u2022\ncause us to incur substantial costs, including costs associated with remediation of information technology systems, customer protection costs and incentive payments for the maintenance of business relationships, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from negative changes in consumer shopping patterns, unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.\nSupply Chain and Third-Party Risks\nWe depend on vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services outside the U.S. Our business could be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political, economic or public health issues associated with, our supply network.\nWe depend on vendors for timely and efficient access to products we sell. We source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the U.S., primarily Asia. Current economic conditions may adversely impact our vendors and they may be unable to access financing or become insolvent and unable to supply us with products. Any major changes in tax policy, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe procurement of all our goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases, which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers. In addition, our procurement of goods and services from outside the U.S. is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, health pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade. All of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond our control and could negatively affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe U.S. has been engaged in extended trade negotiations with China, which has resulted in the implementation of tariffs on a significant number of products manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. On May 10, 2019, the Trump Administration imposed a 25% tariff on approximately $200 billion worth of imports from China into the U.S. (the \u201cStage 3 Tariffs\u201d), which imports include merchandise for both private-label and national brands sold in our stores. On August 1, 2019, the Trump Administration announced its intent to impose a 10% tariff on all remaining imports from China, valued at approximately $300 billion (the \u201cStage 4 Tariffs\u201d), which imports also include merchandise sold in our stores. The proposed Stage 4 Tariffs were increased to 15% in August 2019 following retaliatory tariffs from China, and a portion of such 15% tariffs went into effect on September 1, 2019 (the \u201cStage 4A Tariffs\u201d). Subsequently, in October 2019, the Trump Administration announced the suspension of the remaining new 15% tariffs (the \u201cStage 4B Tariffs\u201d) following positive negotiations with China. On January 15, 2020, the U.S. and China signed an agreement known as the\n\u201cPhase One\u201d trade deal, pursuant to which, among other things, the Stage 3 Tariffs remained unchanged, the Stage 4A Tariffs were reduced from 15% to 7.5%, and the Stage 4B Tariffs were indefinitely suspended.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the effective tariffs, including potential future retaliatory tariffs, as well as other recent changes in foreign trade policy and the U.S. Administration on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability, and are actively working through strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options and working with our vendors and merchants. At this time, it is unknown how long U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will remain in effect or whether additional tariffs will be imposed. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these changes in foreign trade policy and any recently enacted, proposed and future tariffs on products imported by us from China could negatively impact our business, results of operations and liquidity if they seriously disrupt the movement of products through our supply chain or increase their cost. In addition, while we may be able to shift our sourcing options, executing such a shift would be time consuming and would be difficult or impracticable for many products and may result in an increase in our manufacturing costs. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, retaliatory tariffs, or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and/or the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our results of operations and business.\nIf our vendors, or any raw material vendors on which our vendors or our private label business relies, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions or other unforeseen events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nDisruption of global sourcing activities and quality and other concerns over our own brands could negatively impact brand reputation and earnings.\nEconomic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source products, as well as shipping and dockage issues, could adversely impact the availability or cost of our products, or both. Most of the Company\u2019s goods imported to the U.S. arrive from Asia through ports located on the U.S. west coast and are subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports. In addition, in recent years, we have substantially increased the number and types of merchandise that are sold under the Company\u2019s proprietary brands. While we have focused on the quality of our proprietary branded products, we rely on third-parties to manufacture these products. Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may vary from expectations and standards, the products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall these products, or the products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties. We face challenges in seeking indemnities from manufacturers of these products, including the uncertainty of recovering on such indemnity and the lack of understanding by manufacturers of U.S. product liability laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe also face concerns relating to human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions and environmental impact in factories or countries where merchandise that we sell is produced and concerns about transparent sourcing and supply chains. We require all vendors for both private and national brands to comply with our vendor and supplier code of conduct, which outlines minimum standards to help ensure our merchandise is produced in workplaces free of abusive, exploitative or unsafe working conditions, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations of the United States and the country of manufacture or exportation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to production of merchandise, doing business in foreign countries and importing merchandise, and to screen, train and monitor our private label vendors to ensure safe and ethical treatment of workers in our supply chain, there can be no assurance that our vendors and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could subject us to liability and could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations and business.\nMaterial disruptions in relationships with third-parties with whom the Company does business could adversely affect its operations.\nThe Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other commercial relationships. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide products, services, advertising, technology infrastructure, development and support, data analytics, logistics, other goods and services to operate our business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other matters. Furthermore, third-party vendors may sell products directly to consumers in addition to, or in some cases in lieu of, traditional wholesale channels. As our business model depends on offering quality and relevant merchandise brands from third-party vendors\nin addition to our own private label products, any material disruption in our relationship with such vendors, or material disruption in the products or services provided by other third parties, could adversely affect our revenues, expense structure, earnings and operations.\nEconomic, Global, Legal and External Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to discretionary consumer spending, unfavorable economic and political conditions, extreme violence and other related risks.\nOur sales are significantly affected by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt, consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the cost of basic necessities and other goods, the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies and the effects of the weather, natural disasters or health pandemics. These factors can have psychological or economic impacts on consumers that affect their discretionary spending habits. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nUnfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities, armed conflicts or events of extreme violence may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be affected by extreme weather conditions, natural disasters or regional or global health pandemics.\nExtreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages in our stores.\nNatural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could damage or destroy our facilities or make it difficult for customers to travel to our stores, thereby negatively affecting our business and results of operations.\nLitigation, legislation, regulatory developments or non-compliance could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both our core business operations and our credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of our credit card and other operations. Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, including changes in federal or state tax law, interpretation of existing laws and the ability to defend and support the tax positions taken on historical tax returns. Certain changes in any of these factors could materially impact the effective tax rate and net income.\nWe are also subject to anti-bribery, customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although we undertake to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or agents, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary\ncourse of our business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon emissions or other greenhouse gases may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations which could affect our profitability.\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving laws addressing data privacy and data protection and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and many states are considering new regulations in this area, The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and other applicable U.S. privacy laws or new state or federal laws may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to modify our data processing practices or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs to reach compliance or change the manner in which we use data.\nOur sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.\nIf the Company\u2019s merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or consumers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience decreased sales, increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose the Company to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nInability to access capital markets could adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nChanges in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to this potential source of future liquidity. A downgrade in the ratings that rating agencies assign to the Company\u2019s short- and long-term debt has and may continue to negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. In addition, our asset-based credit agreement requires us to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If our results of operations deteriorate to a point where we are not in compliance with our debt covenants, and we are unable to obtain a waiver, much of our debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. Our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and our inability to do so could cause the holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in the Company.\nOur level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, react to changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, or prevent us from making payments on our indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of January 30, 2021, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $4,906 million.\nOur high level of indebtedness could have important consequences for the holders of our debt and equity securities. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and external conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent we make borrowings under our asset-based credit agreement, which bear interest at a variable rate;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions.\nAny of these risks could materially impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFactors beyond our control could affect the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price, like those of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors may include:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, stock, credit and real estate market conditions;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to the Company\u2019s business and industry, including those discussed above;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nadverse business announcements by our competitors;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or purchases of the Company\u2019s common stock; and\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with the Company\u2019s common stock relative to other investment alternatives.\nWe may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If the analysts who regularly follow the Company\u2019s stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, the Company\u2019s stock price could decline. Also, sales of a substantial number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in the public market or the appearance that these shares are available for sale could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 77462, "SIC": 5311, "TIC": "M"}
