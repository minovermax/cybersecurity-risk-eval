{"cik": "105319", "company": "WW INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should consider carefully, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nThe ongoing global outbreak of the COVID-19 virus is adversely impacting, and will continue to adversely impact, our business and may adversely impact our liquidity.\nThe ongoing global outbreak of the coronavirus (including its variants, COVID-19) has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business as well as on the business environment and the markets in which we operate. This global health crisis has also had a significant adverse effect on overall economic conditions and the consumer environment, and we expect consumer demand to continue to be negatively impacted due to changes in consumer sentiment towards our products and services, behavior and confidence and health concerns. The situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly significant change. New developments, including the severity of any variant or surges in COVID-19 cases, new information about health implications, vaccine availability and hesitancy, and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, may negatively impact our business. This dynamic situation is driving uncertainty at the macroeconomic, local and consumer levels. While we continue to actively monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the full extent of the magnitude and duration of its negative impact to our business cannot be predicted with certainty.\nWe have taken steps to address the risks and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have experienced significant disruption to our business and seen significant shifts in consumer sentiment with respect to the weight loss and wellness marketplace as the pandemic evolves. While Digital recruitments were strong in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a subsequent turn in consumer sentiment has driven a decline in Digital recruitments, and recruitment projections for our Digital business are unpredictable. Our Workshops + Digital recruitments were dramatically impacted during the first year of the pandemic, and mix shifted toward our Digital business. This change in our mix, especially when amplified by the nature of our subscription business, has negatively impacted revenue and may continue to impact it in the future. While the number of End of Period Subscribers at the end of fiscal 2021 was essentially flat compared to the pre-pandemic number at the end of fiscal 2019, it decreased 5.8% versus the end of fiscal 2020. Over the longer term, it remains uncertain how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact consumer sentiment for our products and services and consumer preferences and behavior generally. Our member retention in both our Digital and Workshops + Digital businesses may also be significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic.\nFollowing the suspension of our in-person workshops in March 2020, we rapidly transitioned these workshops to an entirely virtual experience. In June 2020, we began a phased re-opening with reduced operations of a limited number of our studio locations. During fiscal 2021, we selectively resumed in-person workshops where profitable and consistent with promoting the health and safety of our employees and members. However, we had to close some of these studios which were re-opened in response to shifting requirements in local jurisdictions as new variants emerged and COVID-19 cases surged. During these uncertain times, we will continue to adhere to the requirements in local jurisdictions to close re-opened studios as necessary. We continue to evolve our workshop strategy as we evaluate our cost structure and respond to shifting consumer sentiments, and accordingly we may need to further reduce operations. We continue to offer virtual workshops, which may not be successful in meeting the needs or preferences of many of our members, employees and the communities in which we operate. This may result in further decreases in our recruitment as well as a significant decrease in our retention of members. Our reduced studio operations have and will continue to adversely impact our in-studio product sales. The decision to resume in-person workshops or close certain workshops has been and will continue to be influenced by a number of factors, including applicable legal restrictions, consumer confidence, sentiment and preferences, cost efficiencies, our evolving workshop strategies and the protection of the health and safety of our employees and members.\nChanges in consumer sentiment and behavior, including willingness to meet in groups, prioritization of discretionary spending, and health concerns, may impact consumer demand for our products and services and recruitment and retention of members in our Digital and Workshops + Digital businesses. We may also find it more difficult to staff our business operations. The perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect attendance at our workshops. These risks may also adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if any self-imposed or government-imposed restrictions are in place for a significant amount of time or repeatedly reinstated. As part of our focus on best meeting our members\u2019 and consumers\u2019 needs, we consolidated certain of our studios and continue to close certain other branded studio locations. As a result, we have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant costs associated with our real estate realignment. The decision to re-open a studio location, if at all, or further consolidate studio locations, will be influenced by a number of factors, including applicable legal restrictions, consumer confidence and preferences, changes in consumer sentiment and behavior, and the protection of the health and safety of our employees and members, and will be dependent on cost efficiencies and alignment with our digital and brand strategy. We may not be able to successfully control our studio environments and realize the intended business advantages of maintaining a select group of studio locations, which could adversely affect our Workshops + Digital business and results of operations.\nOur business depends on a number of third parties including vendors, landlords, lenders, marketing partners, third-party technology providers, and supply chain partners. COVID-19 may have a material adverse impact on these parties and their ability to meet their obligations to us. Any such failure by our third-party partners could negatively impact our ability to provide our products and services to customers. One or more of these third parties may experience financial distress, increased supply or other operational costs, staffing shortages or liquidity challenges, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, the failure of any third-party technology provider to provide continuous and uninterrupted service could result in disruptions in our websites, services and products or network systems. The negative impact of COVID-19 on these third-party partners may result in increased costs of doing business with them which may have a negative impact on our business or results of operations. The full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on these third-party partners continues to evolve and is uncertain.\nIf a significant percentage of our workforce, or the workforces of our third-party partners (and their suppliers), is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our operations may be negatively impacted by labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, among other things. Additionally, the cost of our workforce may increase as we seek to staff in the challenging labor environment. We also depend on senior management and other key personnel and consultants, and the illness of certain personnel or consultants could result in the loss of expertise and negatively affect our operations, brand image and goodwill.\nThe widespread health crisis also could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of countries in which we operate, resulting in an economic downturn, including rising inflation, that could affect consumer demand for our products and services. Our customer purchasing patterns can be influenced by economic factors. The precise impact, and extent thereof, on our business from the disruption of financial markets and the weakening of overall economic conditions cannot be predicted with certainty. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of COVID-19 have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, sustained impact on the economy. Our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending, which may be adversely impacted by a recession or fears of a recession, volatility and declines in the stock market and increasingly pessimistic consumer sentiment due to perceived or actual economic and/or health risks. Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19, and any resulting recession or slowed economic growth, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we have been able to sufficiently address our liquidity needs during the COVID pandemic, the evolving and uncertain economic impact of COVID-19 may impact our liquidity going forward. To the extent that we do not successfully manage our costs, our liquidity and financial results, as well as our ability to access our New Revolving Credit Facility, may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash or to access liquidity at the time and on terms we may require, we may encounter difficulty funding our business requirements including debt repayments when due. We may not be able to access liquidity, including our New Revolving Credit Facility, or the terms and conditions of available credit may be substantially more expensive than previously expected due to changes in our operating results and general financial conditions and credit markets. We may require waivers or amendments to our existing long-term debt and these requirements may trigger pricing increases from lenders for available credit. Reductions in our liquidity position and the need to use capital for other day to day requirements of our business may affect a number of our business initiatives and long-term investments and as a result we may be required to curtail and/or postpone business investments as well as other initiatives that require capital investment.\nDue to the negative COVID-19 environment and the uncertainty of the magnitude and duration of its impact on our business and the economies and financial markets in which we operate, we have previously implemented a number of measures impacting our workforce, including temporary compensation reductions for certain employees, restructurings, and temporary closures of office facilities, and we may need to do so again in the future. These actions, and any actions required in the future, may materially affect our ability to recruit or retain talent.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic (including governmental responses, shifting consumer sentiment and behavior, broad economic impacts and market disruptions) has heightened the risks related to the other risk factors described herein.\nCompetition from other weight management and wellness industry participants or the development of more effective or more favorably perceived weight management methods could result in decreased demand for our services and products.\nThe weight management and wellness marketplace is highly competitive. We compete against a wide range of providers of weight management services and products. Our competitors include: commercial weight management programs; weight loss and wellness apps; surgical procedures; the pharmaceutical industry; the genetics and biotechnology industry; self-help weight management regimens and other self-help weight management products, services and publications, such as books, magazines, websites, and social media influencers and groups; dietary supplements and meal replacement products; healthy living services, coaching, products, content and publications; weight management services administered by doctors, nutritionists and dieticians; government agencies and non-profit groups that offer weight management services; fitness centers; and national drug store chains. As we or others develop new or different weight management services, products, methods or technologies, additional competitors may emerge. Furthermore, existing competitors may enter new markets or expand their offerings or advertising and marketing programs, and future competitors may do the same. More effective or more favorably perceived diet and weight and healthy living management methods, including pharmaceutical treatments, fat and sugar substitutes or other technological and scientific advancements in weight management methods, also may be developed. This competition may reduce demand for our services and products.\nThe purchasing decisions of weight management and healthy living consumers are highly subjective and can be influenced by many factors, such as brand image or reputation, marketing programs, cost, social media presence and sentiment, consumer trends, personalization, the digital platform, content and user experience, and perception of the efficacy of the service and product offerings. Moreover, consumers can, and frequently do, change approaches easily and at little cost. For example, fad diets and weight loss trends, such as low-carbohydrate diets, have adversely affected our revenues from time to time. Also, our revenue has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the popularity of apps, activity monitors and other free or low-cost alternatives. Any decrease in demand for our services and products may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA failure to continue to retain and grow our subscriber base could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nSubscriptions to our businesses generate the predominant portion of our revenue, and our future growth depends upon our ability to retain and grow our subscriber base and audience. To do so will require us to continue to evolve our subscription model, user experience and digital platforms; address changing consumer demands and developments in technology; and improve our services and products while continuing to provide our members with guidance, compelling content, personalization and an inspiring community to enable them to develop healthy habits. We have invested and will continue to invest significant resources in these efforts, but there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain and increase our subscriber base or that we will be able to do so without taking steps such as reducing pricing or incurring subscription acquisition costs that would affect our subscription revenues, margin and/or profitability.\nIf we do not continue to develop new, innovative services and products or if our services, products or brands do not continue to appeal to the market, or if we are unable to successfully expand into new channels of distribution or respond to consumer trends or sentiment, our business may suffer.\nThe weight management and wellness marketplace is subject to changing consumer demands and sentiment based, in large part, on the efficacy and popular appeal of weight management and healthy living programs. The popularity of weight management and healthy living programs is dependent, in part, on their ease of use, cost and channels of distribution as well as consumer trends or sentiment. For example, consumers are increasingly focusing on more integrated lifestyle and fitness approaches and may associate our program with just food, nutrition and diet, which could adversely impact its popularity. Additionally, developments in public opinion on the types of products and services we provide could negatively impact the popular appeal of our services and products. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop and market new, innovative services and products and to enhance our existing services and products, each on a timely basis, to respond to new and evolving consumer demands and sentiment, achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional, weight management, healthy living, technological and other developments. We may not be successful in developing, introducing on a timely basis or marketing any new or enhanced services and products. Additionally, new or enhanced services or products may not appeal to the market or the market\u2019s perception of us. As we announce new articulations of our brands, such as our evolution from Weight Watchers to WW in 2018, and we adopt new trademarks, the marketplace may not embrace or accept them and it may take time to build their reputation and goodwill, both with consumers and with our partners. Our future success also will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully distribute our services and products through appealing channels of distribution, such as social media. Our failure to develop new, innovative services and products and to enhance our existing services and products, the failure of our services, products or brands to continue to appeal to the market or respond to consumer trends or sentiment, or the failure to expand into appealing new channels of distribution could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain members and subscribers and thus adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our strategic initiatives, which could adversely impact our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nWe are continually evaluating the changing consumer environment and the competitive environment of the weight management and healthy living marketplace and seeking out opportunities to improve our performance through the implementation of selected strategic initiatives. The goal of these efforts is to develop and implement a comprehensive and competitive business strategy that addresses those changes. Over the past several years, we have increased our focus on overall health and wellness. We may not be able to successfully implement our strategic initiatives and realize the intended business opportunities, growth prospects, including new business channels, and competitive advantages. Our efforts to capitalize on business opportunities may not bring the intended results. Assumptions underlying expected financial results or consumer demand and receptivity may not be met or economic or consumer conditions may deteriorate. We also may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel, or engage with partners of choice, to implement our strategic initiatives. If these or other factors limit our ability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives, our business activities, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe continually innovate our digital offerings and experiences for our members. For example, in November 2021, we launched our new weight management and wellness program, with corresponding design, usability, features and capabilities updates to our app. In December 2020, we expanded our offerings and introduced Digital 360, a digitally-enabled, community-focused and coach-led membership plan. Such new offerings may not have the same success, or gain traction as quickly, as our past offerings. This increased focus on more personalized and digitally-enabled offerings may not be successful in meeting the needs or preferences of many of our current or potential members. As a result, we may experience decreases in our recruitment and retention of members, or increased member cancellations. We may not be able to successfully launch our new virtual or other digital offerings and realize the intended business opportunities, growth prospects, including new business channels, and competitive advantages of our digital strategy. Assumptions underlying expected financial results or consumer demand and receptivity may not be met or economic or consumer conditions may deteriorate, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19, and may adversely impact our ability to continue to successfully implement this digital strategy. If these or other factors limit our ability to successfully execute this strategic initiative, our business, financial conditions or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur business depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising and marketing programs across multiple platforms, including the strength of our social media presence, to attract and retain members and subscribers.\nOur business success depends on our ability to attract and retain members and subscribers. Our ability to attract and retain members and subscribers depends significantly on the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising and marketing practices across multiple platforms. For example, if our advertising and marketing programs are not effective and fail to attract sufficient recruitments during the first quarter of the fiscal year, our most important period for recruitments, it historically has had an outsized negative impact on our performance for the remainder of the year. Our competitors may create more compelling marketing campaigns, or may devote greater financial and other resources to marketing and advertising, which could drive our current and potential members and subscribers to our competitors. Additionally, our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult. In addition, from time-to-time, we use the success stories of our members and subscribers, and utilize brand ambassadors, spokespersons and social media influencers, including in some cases celebrities, in our advertising and marketing programs to communicate on a personal level with consumers. Actions taken by these individuals that harm their personal reputation or image, or include the cessation of using our services and products, could have an adverse impact on the advertising and marketing campaigns in which they are featured. We and our brand ambassadors, spokespersons and social media influencers also use social media channels as a means of communicating with consumers. Unauthorized or inappropriate use of these channels could result in harmful publicity or negative consumer experiences, which could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our marketing in these channels. In addition, substantial negative commentary by others on social media platforms could have an adverse impact on our reputation and ability to attract and retain members and subscribers. If our advertising and marketing campaigns do not generate a sufficient number of members and subscribers, or fail to develop a high level of engagement with current and potential members and subscribers on various platforms, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur reputation could be impaired due to actions taken by our franchisees, licensees, suppliers and other partners.\nWe believe that our brands, including their widespread recognition and strong reputation and goodwill in the market, are one of our most valuable assets and they provide us with a competitive advantage. Our franchisees operate their businesses under our brands. We license our trademarks to third parties for the manufacture and sale in retail stores by such parties of a variety of goods, including food products, and also co-brand or endorse third-party branded consumer services and products. We also sell through a variety of channels, including online through our e-commerce platforms, at our studios, and through our trusted partners, food and non-food products manufactured by third-party suppliers. In addition, we integrate our services and products with those of other third parties, including through bundled and joint offerings, and integrate data from trusted third-party partners into our offerings. Our third-party partnerships also extend to event sponsorships and co-promotions. Our franchisees, licensees, suppliers and other partners are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, third-party relationships and brand associations. Actions taken by them, including violations of generally accepted ethical business practices or breaches of law, regulations or contractual obligations, such as not following our program or not maintaining our quality and safety standards, could harm our reputation. Also, our products may be subject to product recalls, brand confusion, litigation or other deficiencies, which could harm our brands. Any negative publicity associated with these actions or these third parties would adversely affect our reputation and may result in decreased recruitment, Digital product subscriptions, workshop attendance and product sales and, as a result, lower revenues and profits.\nWe may be required to recognize asset impairment charges for indefinite- and definite-lived assets.\nIn accordance with GAAP (as defined hereafter), we perform impairment reviews of our indefinite-lived assets, which include franchise rights acquired and goodwill, on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require. We also continually evaluate whether current factors or indicators, such as the deterioration in relevant, country macroeconomic conditions, an increased competitive environment, a decline in our financial performance, and/or other prevailing conditions in the capital markets, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets. The process of testing franchise rights acquired, goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment involves numerous judgments, assumptions and estimates made by management which inherently reflect a high degree of uncertainty. Certain factors, including the future profitability of our businesses, the price of our common stock, the market value of our debt and macroeconomic conditions (both at the global and local levels), might have a negative impact on the fair value of these assets. In fiscal 2020, we recorded a $3.7 million impairment charge for goodwill related to our Brazil reporting unit. We may incur additional impairment\ncharges in the future, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nAdditionally, we evaluate definite-lived assets, both tangible, which includes our physical plant and equipment, and intangible, which includes both internally developed and purchased software, for impairment by comparing the net realizable value of the asset to the carrying value of the capitalized cost. If the value of those assets is not deemed to be recoverable, an assessment of the fair value of those assets is performed and, to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized. Should our investment in capitalized definite-lived assets become impaired, there would also be an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nLoss of key personnel, strategic partners or consultants or failure to effectively manage and motivate our workforce could negatively impact our sales of services and products, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on senior management and other key personnel and consultants, and the loss of certain personnel or consultants could result in the loss of management continuity and institutional knowledge and negatively affect our operations, brand image and goodwill. In October 2015, Ms. Winfrey and the Company began a long-term, strategic partnership, which included her making a substantial equity investment in the Company, joining our Board of Directors, providing certain consulting services and granting us the right to use her name and marks. For additional details on these consulting services and rights and the applicable term during which we may benefit, see \u201cItem 1. Business-History-Winfrey Transaction\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with Ms. Winfrey\u2019s name may be damaged if we were to lose her services or if the nature of our partnership changes. The loss of Ms. Winfrey\u2019s services or partnership with us for any reason (including as a result of her death or disability), any negative market or industry perception with respect to her or her participation in the Company\u2019s programs, or the failure by Ms. Winfrey to provide services in her discretion to promote the Company, our programs, services and products or to consult with us and participate in developing, planning, executing and enhancing our programs and related initiatives, all in accordance with our strategic partnership arrangements with her, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also depend heavily upon our coaches and guides to support our customers in their weight management efforts. If we fail to appropriately manage and motivate our coaches and guides, we may not be able to adequately service our customers which could negatively impact our sales of services and products. Changes in factors such as overall unemployment levels, local competition for qualified personnel, prevailing wage rates and employment law, as well as rising employee benefits costs, including insurance in the areas in which we operate, could increase our labor costs and interfere with our ability to adequately retain qualified individuals to provide support to customers. Additionally, our inability to attract and retain qualified coaches and guides could delay or hinder our successfully executing our strategic initiatives.\nWe are undergoing a chief executive officer transition, which could cause disruption to our business or have an adverse impact on our operations and business strategy as well as the public or market perception of our business.\nIn September 2021, Mindy Grossman resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective on the earlier of (i) the commencement of employment of any successor Chief Executive Officer (or interim replacement) and (ii) April 15, 2022. On February 23, 2022, we appointed Sima Sistani as Chief Executive Officer, effective March 21, 2022, with Ms. Grossman resigning as President and Chief Executive Officer as of March 18, 2022. Any significant leadership change or executive management transition involves inherent risk and can be inherently difficult to manage. It may involve a diversion of resources and management attention, be disruptive to our daily operations or relationships with customers, suppliers, and employees, make it more difficult to hire and retain key employees, impact our public or market perception or hinder progress on key strategic initiatives, any of which could have a negative impact on our business or stock price.\nThe inability to renew certain of our licenses, or the inability to do so on terms that are favorable to us, could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have entered into licensing, co-branding and endorsement relationships with numerous partners for the distribution and sale of certain products and services that are relevant and helpful to weight- and health-conscious consumers. These arrangements are typically for fixed terms, following which the parties decide whether to extend the term of the arrangement. There is no guarantee that we will reach mutually agreeable terms with our partners for extending an arrangement. Similarly, in those instances where a licensee enjoys the option to extend the term of a license as a result of having achieved certain conditions, there is no guarantee that the licensee will avail itself of such option. Our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to extend a licensing, co-branding or endorsement arrangement, if we are unable to do so on terms favorable to us, or if we cannot locate a suitable alternative to an incumbent licensee who has decided not to renew its arrangement.\nExpiration or early termination by us of leases could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur operations, including corporate offices, are located in leased office space and many of our workshops are held in leased space in retail centers. As leases expire, we may not be able to renew them on acceptable terms or secure suitable replacement locations. As we decide to relocate or close studios before the expiration of the applicable lease term, we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or \u201cbuy out\u201d the remaining term of the lease. For example, in fiscal 2021 we recorded a $12.2 million charge in connection with the closure of certain studios. Any of the above events could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur business may decline as a result of a downturn in general economic conditions or consumer confidence.\nOur business is highly dependent on product subscriptions, workshop fees and product sales. A downturn in general economic conditions, including inflationary environments, or consumer confidence in any of our markets could result in people curtailing or reallocating their discretionary spending which, in turn, could reduce product subscriptions, attendance at our workshops and product sales. Any reduction in consumer spending may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not successfully make acquisitions or enter into joint ventures or collaborations and we may not successfully integrate, operate or realize the anticipated benefits of such businesses.\nAs part of our strategic initiatives, we may pursue selected acquisitions, joint ventures or collaborations. We may not be able to effect these transactions or partnerships on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Additionally, if the market negatively perceives our business or financial condition, we may not be a partner of choice for such transactions or partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to enter into such transactions or partnerships and the terms thereof. Any future acquisitions or joint ventures may require access to additional capital, and we may not have access to such capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we enter into these transactions, we may not realize the benefits we anticipate or we may experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, technologies and products into our existing business or in providing our services and products in newly acquired markets; attrition of key personnel from acquired businesses; significant charges or expenses; higher costs of integration than we anticipated; or unforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our services and products or the expansion of our existing operations.\nOur ability to influence the control of, or distributions from, our joint ventures may be limited by contract or otherwise. If any of the other investors in one of our joint ventures fails to observe its commitments, or its interests are different than ours, the joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan, we may be required to increase our level of commitment, or such entities may take actions which are not in our best interest. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our joint venture partners, we could lose our ability to operate in the geographies and/or markets in which they operate, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe also may be limited by contract or otherwise with respect to, or have no control over, the resources that any third party partner may devote to the research, development and commercialization of services and products under our collaborations. Any of our collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected. Our collaborators may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct research, development or commercialization activities successfully, in a timely manner or in compliance with legal requirements. Additionally, disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with our collaboration partners. The failure of our collaboration partners to meet their obligations, adequately deploy resources or to satisfactorily resolve disputes with us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConsummating these transactions and partnerships could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions and partnerships, which would dilute our existing shareholders.\nThe seasonal nature of our business could cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations due to the seasonal nature of our business. Historically, the first quarter of the fiscal year, known as our winter season, is the most important quarter for recruitments. Given the subscription nature of our products, failure to realize recruitments during the winter season could negatively impact our performance for the remainder of the year. Seasonality also impacts relative revenue and profitability of each quarter of the year, both on a quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year basis. This seasonality could cause our share price to fluctuate as the results of an interim financial period may not be indicative of our full year results.\nAny event that discourages or impedes people from gathering with others, whether at a gathering place, work or otherwise, or impedes accessing resources could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to conditions beyond our control, including health epidemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), extreme weather and climate conditions (which may become more frequent and more severe with the increasing effects of climate change), war, terrorism, loss of resources such as electricity and internet connections, national disasters and other extraordinary events, that may prevent or impede in-person or virtual workshop attendance or accessing our Digital products. These conditions could also impact the ability of our suppliers and other third party partners to meet their obligations to us and negatively impact our ability to provide our products and services to customers. The occurrence of any event that discourages people from gathering with others or impedes their ability to access our services and products could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we could fail to report our financial results accurately.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. In the past we have discovered, and in the future we may discover, areas of our internal control over financial reporting that need improvement. In the future, if we identify a control deficiency that rises to the level of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, this material weakness may adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and, as a result, our financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity\nOur substantial amount of debt and our debt service obligations, as well as our exposure to variable rate indebtedness, could adversely affect our financial condition, and the restrictions of our debt covenants could impede our operations and flexibility.\nAs of January 1, 2022, our total debt was $1,445.0 million. In addition, at January 1, 2022, we had $173.9 million available under our revolving credit facility. $945.0 million of our debt consists of variable-rate instruments so we are subject to the risk of higher interest rates. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rates through interest rate swaps. At the end of fiscal 2021, we had in effect interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million.\nOur high degree of debt leverage could have significant consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including the borrowings under our credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments and otherwise satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default;\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability and flexibility to make strategic acquisitions and to take advantage of other strategic opportunities to grow our business funded by significant additional indebtedness or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged or may have greater financial resources than us;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur credit facilities and the indenture governing our notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness in the future. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks we face as a result of our leverage could intensify.\nWhile there is no net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) leverage ratio maintenance requirement on the debt outstanding under our credit facilities (other than when the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding revolving loans plus letters of credit exceeds 35% of the amount of the lenders\u2019 revolving commitments, as further discussed below), our credit facilities and the indenture governing our notes contain customary covenants for a non-investment grade company, including covenants that in certain circumstances restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, pay dividends on and redeem capital stock, make investments, sell our assets and enter into acquisitions, mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets, prepay subordinated debt and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to baskets, thresholds and other exceptions. Under the terms of our credit facilities, depending on our leverage ratio, we are obligated to offer to prepay our term loan facilities in an aggregate amount determined by our excess cash flow. In addition, our revolving credit facility includes a maintenance covenant that requires compliance with certain first lien secured net leverage ratios when the aggregate principal amount of all revolving loans plus available, undrawn letters of credit and unreimbursed letters of credit (subject to customary exceptions and thresholds) as of the end of a fiscal quarter exceeds 35% of the amount of the lenders\u2019 revolving commitments.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants could result in an acceleration of our debt, cause cross-defaults under our other debt, lead to the foreclosure on assets collateralizing secured debt (and the lenders and holders of that secured debt would rank ahead of the holders of unsecured debt in the proceeds of those assets) and result in our lenders terminating all commitments to extend further credit. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness, and we may not be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Any such prepayment or refinancing could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we incur additional debt in the future, we may be subject to additional covenants, which may be more restrictive than those to which we are currently subject.\nAdditionally, borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness may increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, if our then-effective swaps, if any, do not reduce our exposure. In addition, certain of our variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, or the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided or no longer be representative (i) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar settings, and (ii) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of all remaining U.S. dollar settings. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of Currency, and other interagency regulatory bodies advised U.S. banks to stop entering into new U.S. dollar LIBOR based contracts by December 31, 2021. The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, or the ARRC, a committee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. There are significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR, such as LIBOR being an unsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured lending rate, and SOFR is an overnight rate while LIBOR reflects term rates at different maturities. Although SOFR is the ARRC\u2019s recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from LIBOR in ways similar to SOFR or in other ways that would result in higher interest costs for us.\nIn the event that LIBOR is phased out as is currently expected, our New Credit Agreement (defined hereafter) provides that the Company and the administrative agent may amend the New Credit Agreement to replace the LIBOR definition therein with a successor rate subject to notifying the lending syndicate of such change and not receiving within five business days of such notification objections to such replacement rate from lenders holding at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of loans and commitments then outstanding under the New Credit Agreement; provided that such lending syndicate may not object to a SOFR-based successor rate contained in any such amendment. If we fail to do so, our borrowings will be based off of the alternative base rate plus a margin.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and satisfy our other liquidity requirements.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our future performance, which may be affected by financial, business, economic, demographic and other factors, such as attitudes toward weight management and wellness programs and pressure from our competitors. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we have a term loan facility with an outstanding aggregate principal amount of $945.0 million due in April 2028, a revolving credit facility with availability of $173.9 million maturing in April 2026 and $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.500% senior secured notes due in April 2029. We expect to pay the principal and interest due on the term loan facility and our notes from a combination of our cash flows provided by operating activities and by opportunistically using other means to repay or refinance our obligations as we determine appropriate. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flows provided by operating activities in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on all of our outstanding debt.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability, if any, to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt, if available on acceptable terms or at all, could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any deterioration in our performance may result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or our ability to refinance our debt obligations on favorable terms or at all.\nRisk Related to Technology, Security and Intellectual Property\nAny failure of our technology or systems to perform satisfactorily could result in an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on software, hardware, network systems and similar technology, including cloud-based technology, that is either developed by us or licensed from or maintained by third parties to operate our websites and platforms, Digital subscription product offerings, and other services and products such as the recurring billing system associated with certain of our commitment plans, and to support our business operations. As much of this technology is complex, there may be future errors, defects or performance problems, including when we update our technology or integrate new technology to expand and enhance our capabilities. Our technology may malfunction or suffer from defects that become apparent only after extended use. The integrity of our technology may also be compromised as a result of third-party cyber-attacks, such as hacking, spear phishing campaigns and denial of service (DOS) attacks, which are increasingly negatively impacting companies. In addition, our operations depend on our ability to protect our information technology systems against damage from third-party cyber-attacks, fire, power loss, water, earthquakes, telecommunications failures and similar unexpected adverse events. Disruptions in our websites, apps, services and products or network systems could result from a number of factors, including unknown technical defects, insufficient capacity, the failure of our third-party providers to provide continuous and uninterrupted service and unusual volume in traffic for our platforms. Such disruptions would be most impactful if they occurred during peak activity periods and may impact accessibility to our services and products. While we maintain disaster recovery capabilities to return to normal operation in a timely manner, and we deploy multiple parallel instances of our applications across multiple computer resources, we do not have a fully redundant system that includes an instantaneous recovery capability. In the event we experience significant disruptions, we may be unable to repair our systems in an efficient and timely manner, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAs a result of such possible defects, failures, interruptions or other problems, our services and products could be rendered unreliable or be perceived as unreliable by customers, which could result in harm to our reputation and brands. Any failure of our technology or systems could result in an adverse impact on our business.\nOur reputation and the appeal of our services and products may be harmed by data security breaches and other malicious acts or privacy concerns.\nBreaches of data security, website defacements and other malicious acts, which are increasingly negatively impacting companies, could result in unauthorized access to proprietary or customer information or data, including credit card transaction data, or cause interruptions to our services and products. Such unauthorized access or interruptions could harm our reputation and brands and expose us to liability and regulatory claims, and may result in the loss of existing or potential customers. We rely upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we provide content and collect, store and utilize confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal customer information and data), and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information as well as comply with applicable regulatory requirements and contractual obligations.\nWe also have outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information and website content. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to security breaches. While we have invested, including by maintaining cybersecurity insurance coverage, and developed systems and processes designed to protect such proprietary or customer information or data and our website content, these measures are costly, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches and other malicious acts.\nExisting, proposed or new data privacy legislation and regulations, including interpretations thereof, could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes increased privacy and security requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of Europe. As a result, we have implemented measures to comply with these requirements, including, among other things, documenting our data processing activities and informing users about how we use their personal data. We also obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data for certain aspects of our services and products. In addition, the GDPR requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our designated European privacy regulator. The GDPR also includes significant penalties for non-compliance with any of several requirements of the regulation. Data protection and privacy laws have also been enacted by the U.S. federal and state governments, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became effective on January 1, 2020, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other relevant statutes. These laws also typically include notification obligations and impose significant penalties and potential liability for non-compliance. The data privacy and security regulatory regime continues to evolve and is increasingly demanding. Many states are considering privacy and security legislation and there are ongoing discussions regarding a national privacy law. Variations in requirements across jurisdictions could present compliance challenges, and any failures to comply with such requirements may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nFurther, many jurisdictions require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information, and additional jurisdictions and governmental entities are considering such laws. In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported. If we experience, or in certain cases suspect, a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation, brands and business may be harmed. Prospective and existing customers and clients may have concerns regarding our use of private information or data collected on our apps and websites or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses. These privacy concerns could keep customers and clients from using our apps and websites or purchasing our services or products, and third parties from partnering with us.\nWhile no cybersecurity breach or attack to date has had a material impact on our business or results of operations, there can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology networks and related systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. In addition, the transmission of computer viruses, or similar malware, could adversely affect our information technology systems and harm our business operations. As a result, it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and other resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by security breaches. These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a sufficient protection or remedy.\nThird parties may infringe on our brands and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe currently rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade dress, trade secret, patent and other intellectual property laws and domain name dispute resolution systems to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brands and technology. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brands, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, including reverse engineering of technology, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brands and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving. These evolving legal standards may not sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims.\nThird parties may make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content. If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings. Any of these results could reduce our revenues or our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations, Litigation, Laws and Regulations\nOur international operations expose us to regulatory, economic, political, social and intellectual property risks in the countries in which we operate.\nThe international nature of our operations involves a number of risks, including changes in U.S. and foreign regulations, tariffs, taxes and exchange controls; economic downturns; inflation and political and social instability in the countries in which we operate; weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and limitations on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights under some local laws; and our dependence on foreign personnel. For example, during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the United Kingdom voted by referendum to exit the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom ceased to be part of the EU and the transition period ended on December 31, 2020. The EU and the UK agreed to an EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\u201cTCA\u201d) that governs the trading relationship between the UK and the member states of the EU from January 1, 2021. Broadly, the TCA provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin, but is subject to both parties maintaining a level playing field in areas such as environmental protection, social and labor rights, investment, competition, state aid, and tax transparency. Brexit has and continues to create general economic uncertainty in the UK and EU. The effects of Brexit could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows, particularly with respect to our United Kingdom reportable segment.\nForeign regulations may also restrict our ability to operate in some countries, acquire new businesses, recur bill our customers or repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries back to the United States. If we expand our operations into additional foreign countries, we may be subject to additional risks, including the ability to successfully adapt to local culture and navigate regulatory, economic, political, social and intellectual property risks. We cannot be certain that we will be able to enter and successfully compete in additional foreign markets or that we will be able to continue to compete in the foreign markets in which we currently operate.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risks from our international operations that could adversely affect our financial results.\nA significant portion of our revenues and operating costs are denominated in foreign currencies. We are therefore exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our foreign operations receive revenues and pay expenses. We do not currently hedge, and have not historically hedged, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Our consolidated financial results are presented in U.S. dollars and therefore, during times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international revenues and earnings will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. In addition, the assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are recorded in shareholders\u2019 equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Translation adjustments arising from intercompany receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries are generally recorded as a component of other expense (income). Accordingly, changes in currency exchange rates will cause our revenues, operating costs, net income and shareholders\u2019 equity to fluctuate.\nOutcomes of litigation or regulatory actions could adversely impact our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of legal actions and regulatory proceedings, we cannot predict their outcomes with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal or regulatory actions. For example, the previously disclosed adverse UK tax ruling relating to our self-employment model in the United Kingdom resulted in an aggregate adverse charge of approximately $37.0 million in fiscal 2009. As we expand our wellness offerings, consumers may misconstrue our program as providing medical advice. As we clearly state in our consumer communications, most of our coaches and guides do not have extensive training or certification in nutrition, diet or health fields beyond the training they receive from us. Despite our disclaimers, as more customers come to us seeking a healthy lifestyle, they may misperceive that our coaches and guides are providing medical advice. We may also be subject to claims that our coaches and guides have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers when needed. Regardless of the outcome of any legal action or regulatory proceeding, such actions and proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that our management devote substantial time and resources to defend us.\nOur business is subject to legislative and regulatory restrictions.\nA number of laws and regulations govern our advertising and marketing, services, products, operations and relations with consumers, licensees, franchisees, coaches, guides, employees and government authorities in the countries in which we operate.\nCertain federal, state and foreign agencies, such as the FTC and FDA, regulate and enforce such laws and regulations relating to advertising and marketing, promotions, packaging, labeling, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements, and other consumer protection matters. A determination by a federal, state or foreign agency, or a court in connection with a governmental enforcement action or private litigation, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity, and restrictions on our business operations. For example, during the mid-1990s, the FTC filed complaints against a number of commercial weight management providers alleging violations of federal law in connection with the use of advertisements that featured testimonials, claims for program success and program costs. In 1997, we entered into a consent order with the FTC settling all contested issues raised in the complaint filed against us. The consent order required us to comply with certain procedures and disclosures in connection with our advertisements of services and products and expired by its terms in 2017. Subsequent to our 2018 acquisition of Kurbo, we became subject to additional obligations under the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable laws and regulations enforced by the FTC and other agencies. In February 2022, the FTC filed a complaint and proposed settlement order to resolve allegations that Kurbo violated COPPA. For additional information, see Note 16 of our audited consolidated financial statements, contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to many distinct employment, labor, commercial, benefits and tax laws and regulations in each country in which we operate, including regulations affecting our employment and wage and hour practices and our relations with our employees, coaches and guides. If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations that differ from our interpretations, are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, or are subject to litigation with respect to these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLaws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet, such as those governing consumer protection, intellectual property, privacy and taxation, continue to evolve. Recent examples include the enactment of the GDPR and the CCPA. If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws or regulations that differ from our interpretations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFuture laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our advertising and marketing practices, consumer pricing and billing arrangements, relations with consumers, employees, coaches, guides, brand ambassadors, spokespersons, social media influencers, licensees or franchisees, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nArtal has significant influence over us and may have conflicts of interest with us or the holders of our common stock.\nArtal owns approximately 21% of our outstanding common stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over the election and removal of our directors and our corporate and management policies, including potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales, the amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of our ownership may delay or deter possible changes in control of our company, which may reduce the value of an investment in our common stock. So long as Artal owns 10% or more of our common stock, Artal will have the right pursuant to an agreement with us to nominate directors to our Board of Directors in proportion to its stock ownership. The interests of Artal may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nIf our existing large shareholders sell a substantial amount of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock by existing large shareholders, or the perception that such sales could occur, including sales by Artal or Ms. Winfrey, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. In fiscal 2018, Artal sold 14,625,000 shares of our common stock and Ms. Winfrey sold 2,359,702 shares of our common stock (including shares transferred by Ms. Winfrey as a gift to The Oprah Winfrey Charitable Foundation that were subsequently sold by such foundation). Sales such as these, and the possibility that additional sales may occur in the future, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except that any shares held by our affiliates, as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act and including Artal and Ms. Winfrey, may be sold only in compliance with certain limitations applicable to affiliates.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws and Virginia corporate law contain provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt.\nProvisions contained in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the laws of Virginia, the state in which we are incorporated, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our shareholders. Thus, our Board of Directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company. In addition, a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89244, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "WW"}
