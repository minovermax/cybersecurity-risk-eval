Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Corporation's common stock involves certain risks, including, among others, the risks described below. In addition to the other information contained in this report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors.\nINTEREST RATE AND LIQUIDITY RISKS.\nThe Corporation is subject to interest rate risk.\nThe Corporation cannot predict or control changes in interest rates. The Corporation is affected by fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, including those of the FRB, which regulates the national money supply and engages in other lending and investment activities in order to manage recessionary and inflationary pressures, many of which affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the most significant component of the Corporation's net income, accounting for approximately 76% of total revenues in 2014. The narrowing of interest rate spreads, the difference between interest rates earned on loans and investments and interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings, has adversely affected the Corporation's net interest income.\nLow market interest rates have pressured the net interest margin in recent years. Interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, have been originated, acquired or repriced at lower rates, reducing the average rate earned on those assets. While the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, has also declined, the decline has not always occurred at the same pace as the decline in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets, resulting in a narrowing of the net interest margin.\nCompetition sometimes requires the Corporation to lower rates charged on loans more than the decline in market rates would otherwise indicate. Competition may also require the Corporation to pay higher rates on deposits than market rates would otherwise indicate. Thus, although loan demand has improved in recent years, intense competition among lenders has contributed to downward pressure on loan yields, also narrowing the net interest margin. Further, due to historically low market interest rates, rates paid on deposits have tended to reach a natural floor below which it is difficult to further reduce such rates. See Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" \"Net Interest Income.\"\nChanges in interest rates can affect demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services.\nMovements in interest rates can cause demand for some of the Corporation\u2019s products and services to be cyclical. As a result, the Corporation may need to periodically scale certain of its businesses, including its personnel, to match increases and decreases in demand and volume. The need to change the scale of these businesses is challenging and there is often a lag between changes in the businesses and the Corporation\u2019s reaction to these changes. For example, demand for residential mortgage loans has historically tended to increase during periods when interest rates were declining and to decrease during periods when interest rates were rising.\nChanges in interest rates or disruption in liquidity markets may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s sources of funding.\nThe Corporation must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of its depositors and borrowers. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity management emphasizes core deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments as its primary sources of liquidity. These primary sources of liquidity can be supplemented by FHLB advances, borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank, proceeds from the sales of loans and liquidity resources of the holding company, including capital markets funding. Lower-cost, core deposits may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and the supplemental sources of liquidity are often more expensive and may not always be as readily available. Technology and other factors have also made it more convenient for customers to transfer low-cost deposits into higher-cost deposits or into alternative investments or deposits of other banks or non-bank providers; these funding changes can also increase the Corporation\u2019s funding costs and/or create liquidity challenges.\nWhile the Corporation attempts to manage its liquidity through various techniques, assumptions and estimates used do not always accurately forecast the impact of changes in customer behavior. For example, the Corporation may face limitations on its ability to fund loan growth if customers move funds out of the Corporation\u2019s subsidiary banks\u2019 deposit accounts in response to increases in interest rates. In the current, low interest rate environment, customers are less sensitive to interest rates when making deposit decisions. However, should interest rates rise, customers may become more aware of interest rate differences and alternative opportunities, which could cause them to move funds into those other opportunities and out of deposit accounts maintained by the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries.\nMarket conditions have been negatively impacted by disruptions in the liquidity markets in the past, and such disruptions or an adverse change in the Corporation's results of operations or financial condition could, in the future, have a negative impact on secondary sources of liquidity. See Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\" \"Interest Rate Risk, Asset/Liability Management and Liquidity.\"\nLiquidity planning at both the bank and holding company levels has become an area of increased regulatory emphasis.\nDue to regulatory limitations on the Corporation\u2019s ability to rely on short-term borrowings, any significant movements of deposits away from traditional depository accounts which negatively impacts the Corporation\u2019s loan-to-deposit ratio could restrict its ability to achieve growth in loans or require the Corporation to pay higher interest rates on deposit products in order to retain deposits to fund loans.\nLiquidity must also be managed at the holding company level. Banking regulators carefully scrutinize liquidity at the holding company level, in addition to consolidated and bank liquidity levels. For safety and soundness reasons, banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends. Generally, these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks' regulatory capital levels and their net income. These factors have affected some institutions' ability to pay dividends and have required some institutions to establish borrowing facilities at the holding company level.\nLEGAL, COMPLIANCE AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS.\nThe supervision and regulation to which the Corporation is subject is increasing and can be a competitive disadvantage.\nVirtually every aspect of the Corporation's operations is subject to extensive regulation and, in the current regulatory climate, the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, especially given the Corporation's size and complexity.\nThe Corporation has six banking subsidiaries and the Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by a variety of federal and state banking regulatory agencies. This corporate structure presents challenges, specifically, the need for compliance with different, and potentially inconsistent, regulatory requirements. The time, expense and internal and external resources associated with regulatory compliance continue to increase, and balancing the need to address regulatory changes and effectively manage overall non-interest expenses has become more challenging than it has been in the past. Thus, the Corporation\u2019s compliance obligations increase the Corporation's expense, require increasing amounts of management's attention and can be a disadvantage from a competitive standpoint with respect to non-regulated competitors and larger bank competitors. The Corporation has announced that it is developing plans to seek regulatory approval to begin the process of consolidating its six subsidiary banks. This process is expected to eventually result in the Corporation conducting its core banking business through a single subsidiary bank. The timing of the commencement of this multi-year process will depend significantly on the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries making necessary progress in enhancing a largely centralized compliance program designed to comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and related anti-money laundering regulations (collectively, the BSA/AML Requirements), and establishing, to the satisfaction of the Corporation\u2019s banking regulatory agencies, that those enhancements are sustainable to achieve compliance with the regulatory enforcement orders issued to the Corporation and its subsidiary banks by their respective banking regulatory agencies relating to identified deficiencies in that compliance program. There is no assurance that the regulatory approvals required for such consolidation could be obtained or that such consolidation would significantly reduce the time, expense and internal and external resources associated with regulatory compliance.\nThe Corporation may incur negative consequences from regulatory violations, including inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nCompliance with banking statutes and regulations is important to the Corporation\u2019s ability to engage in new activities and to consummate certain transactions. Banking regulators are scrutinizing banks through longer and more intensive bank examinations. The results of such examinations could result in a delay or failure to receive required regulatory approvals for potential new activities and transactional matters. Federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions, as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher deposit insurance premiums and limitations on the Corporation\u2019s operations and expansion activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business and profitability. As noted below and as examples of such limitations, the regulatory enforcement orders to which the Corporation and five of its subsidiary banks are subject impose certain restrictions on the expansion activities of the Corporation and such subsidiary banks.\nFurther, failure to comply with these regulatory requirements, including inadvertent or unintentional violations, may result in the assessment of fines and penalties, or the commencement of further informal or formal regulatory enforcement actions against the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries. Other negative consequences also can result from such failures, including regulatory restrictions on the Corporation's activities, including restrictions on the Corporation\u2019s ability to grow through acquisition, reputational damage, restrictions on the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in the Corporation's securities, and increases in the Corporation's costs of doing business. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to regulatory enforcement orders requiring improvement in compliance functions and remedial actions.\nIn recent years, a combination of financial reform legislation and heightened scrutiny by banking regulators have significantly increased expectations regarding what constitutes an effective risk and compliance management infrastructure. To keep pace with these expectations, the Corporation has invested considerable resources in initiatives designed to strengthen its risk management framework and regulatory compliance programs, including those designed to comply with the BSA/AML Requirements.\nNonetheless, during 2014, the Corporation and five of its banking subsidiaries became subject to regulatory enforcement orders issued by banking regulatory agencies relating to identified deficiencies in a largely centralized compliance program (the BSA/AML Compliance Program) designed to comply with the BSA/AML Requirements (the 2014 Regulatory Orders). The 2014 Regulatory Orders are described in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 18, 2014, September 9, 2014, and December 29, 2014.\nOn February 25, 2015, Fulton Bank of New Jersey (FBNJ), the Corporation\u2019s sixth banking subsidiary, entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) consenting to the issuance by the FDIC of a Consent Order (the 2015 FDIC Consent Order). In addition, on February 25, 2015, FBNJ entered into a Consent Order with the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance for the State of New Jersey (the New Jersey Consent Order, and, together with the FDIC Consent Order, the 2015 Consent Orders). See Part II, Item 9B \"Other Information\" for additional information regarding the 2015 Consent Orders.\nThe 2014 Regulatory Orders and the 2015 Consent Orders (collectively, the Regulatory Orders) require, among other things, that the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries review, assess and take actions to strengthen and enhance the BSA/AML Compliance Program, and, in some cases, conduct retrospective reviews of past account activity and transactions, as well as certain reports filed in accordance with the BSA/AML Requirements, to determine whether suspicious activity and certain transactions in currency were properly identified and reported in accordance with the BSA/AML Requirements.\nIn addition to requiring strengthening and enhancement of the BSA/AML Compliance Program,while the Regulatory Orders remain in effect, the Corporation is subject to certain restrictions on expansion activities of the Corporation and its subsidiary banks. Further, any failure to comply with the requirements of any of the Regulatory Orders involving the Corporation or its subsidiary banks could result in further enforcement actions, the imposition of material restrictions on the activities of the Corporation or its subsidiary banks, or the assessment of fines or penalties.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Corporation incurred approximately $8 million of outside services expense related to strengthening and enhancing the BSA/AML Compliance Program. Additional expenses and investments have been incurred as the Corporation further expanded its hiring of personnel and use of outside professionals, such as consulting and legal services, and capital investments in operating systems to strengthen and support the BSA/AML Compliance Program, as well as the Corporation\u2019s broader compliance and risk management infrastructures. The expense and capital investment associated with all of these efforts, including in connection with the Regulatory Orders, have had an adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations in recent periods and could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations in future periods.\nAs noted below, recruitment and retention of the personnel necessary to strengthen and enhance the Corporation\u2019s BSA/AML Compliance Program can be challenging. Further, the Corporation\u2019s employees have been required to adopt and embrace governance practices necessary to strengthen the Corporation\u2019s risk management framework and regulatory compliance programs, which can pose additional challenges in retaining and motivating the Corporation\u2019s employees.\nFinally, due to the existence of the Regulatory Orders, some counterparties may not be permitted to, due to their internal policies, or may choose not to do business with the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries. Should counterparties which the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries rely upon for the conduct of their business become unwilling to do business with the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries, the Corporation\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely effected.\nFinancial reform legislation continues to have a significant impact on the Corporation's business and results of operations; however, until more implementing regulations are adopted, the extent to which the legislation will impact the Corporation is uncertain.\nOn July 21, 2010, the President of the United States signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The scope of the Dodd-Frank Act impacted many aspects of the financial services industry, and the Act requires the development and adoption of many regulations, a significant number of which have not yet been adopted or fully implemented. The effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry depends, in large part, upon the extent to which regulators exercise the authority granted to them under the Dodd-Frank Act and the approaches taken in implementing regulations. The delay in the implementation of many of the regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act on the timelines contemplated by such legislation has resulted in a lack of clear regulatory guidance to banks with respect to certain matters. The resulting uncertainty can cause banks to take a cautious approach to business initiatives and planning. Additional uncertainty regarding the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act exists due to court decisions and the potential for additional legislative changes to the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe Corporation, as well as the broader financial services industry, is continuing to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act (and its possible impact on customers' behaviors) on its business and operations and, at this stage, the extent of the impact cannot be fully determined with any degree of certainty. However, the Corporation has been impacted, and will likely continue to be in the future, by the so-called Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which reduced debit card interchange revenue of banks, and revised FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Corporation has also been impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act in the areas of corporate governance, capital requirements, risk management, stress testing and regulation under consumer protection laws.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB. Among other things, the CFPB was given rulemaking authority over most providers of consumer financial services in the U.S., examination and enforcement authority over the consumer operations of large banks, as well as interpretive authority with respect to numerous existing consumer financial services regulations. The CFPB began exercising these oversight authorities over the largest banks during 2011. Because the CFPB is a relatively new agency, the impact on the Corporation, including its retail banking and mortgage businesses, is largely uncertain. However, any new regulatory requirements, or modified interpretations of existing regulations, will affect the Corporation's consumer business practices and operations, potentially resulting in increased compliance costs. Furthermore, the CFPB represents an additional source of potential enforcement or litigation against the Corporation and, as a relatively new agency with a focus on consumer protection, the CFPB may have new or different enforcement or litigation strategies than those utilized by other banking regulatory agencies. Such actions could further increase the Corporation's costs.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a series of final rules in January 2013 related to mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing. These final rules, most provisions of which became effective January 10, 2014, prohibit creditors, such as the Corporation's bank subsidiaries, from extending residential mortgage loans without regard for the consumer's ability to repay, provide certain safe harbor protections for the origination of loans that meet the requirements for a \"qualified mortgage\" and add restrictions and requirements to residential mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules restrict the imposition of prepayment penalties and compensation practices relating to residential mortgage loan origination. Compliance with these rules will likely increase the Corporation\u2019s overall regulatory compliance costs and required the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries to change their underwriting practices. Moreover, these rules may adversely affect the volume of mortgage loans that the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries originate and may subject those subsidiaries to increased potential liability related to their residential loan origination activities. In December 2013, the CFPB issued final rules revising and integrating previously separate disclosures required under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act in connection with closed-end consumer mortgages. These final rules will become effective August 1, 2015, and compliance with these rules will require the Corporation to adapt its systems and procedures to accommodate the use of new disclosure forms to be provided to closed-end consumer mortgage borrowers at the time of application and at the time of closing for those loans within the timeframes required under these new rules. Compliance with these new rules may increase the Corporation\u2019s overall regulatory compliance costs. See also Part I, Item 1, \"Business,\" \"Supervision and Regulation.\"\nAdditional growth, particularly at the Corporation's largest subsidiary, Fulton Bank, N.A., would subject it to additional regulation and increased supervision.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional regulatory requirements on institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. The Corporation's largest bank subsidiary, Fulton Bank, N.A., had $9.5 billion in assets as of December 31, 2014. Additional growth (or the consolidation of the Corporation\u2019s subsidiary banks as discussed above) that results in Fulton Bank, N.A. having assets of $10 billion or more would subject Fulton Bank, N.A. to the following:\n\u2022\nSupervision, examination and enforcement jurisdiction by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial protection laws;\n\u2022\nStress testing requirements;\n\u2022\nA modified methodology for calculating FDIC insurance assessments and potentially higher assessment rates as a result of institutions with $10 billion or more in assets being required to bear a greater portion of the cost of raising the FDIC reserve ratio to 1.35% as required by the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\u2022\nHeightened compliance standards under the Volcker Rule; and\n\u2022\nEnhanced supervision as a larger financial institution.\nSee also Part I, Item 1, \"Business,\" \"Supervision and Regulation.\"\nNegative publicity could damage the Corporation\u2019s reputation.\nReputation risk, or the risk to the Corporation's earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in the Corporation's business. Negative public opinion could result from the Corporation's actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, regulatory, compliance, mergers and acquisitions, and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct. Because the Corporation conducts the majority of its businesses under the \"Fulton\" brand, negative public opinion about one business could affect the Corporation's other businesses.\nSTRATEGIC AND EXTERNAL RISKS.\nThe Corporation is in the process of transforming its business model and this transformation may not be successful.\nThe Corporation historically has followed a \u201csuper-community\u201d banking strategy under which the Corporation has operated its subsidiary banks autonomously to maximize the advantages of the community banking model in serving the needs to its customers. Reliance on this model has posed challenges to the Corporation's efforts to manage risk efficiently and effectively through a centralized risk management and compliance function. As a result, over the next several years, the Corporation plans to transition to a business model that will be oriented less on geographic boundaries and more focused on alignment with the customer segments the Corporation serves.\nThe transformation of the Corporation\u2019s business model may have some or all of the following unintended effects:\n\u2022\nThe efficiencies sought may not be achieved;\n\u2022\nSome customers may not receive the change in business model in a positive manner and relationships with these customers may be jeopardized;\n\u2022\nThe changes in organizational structure and the evolution of the Corporation\u2019s culture that will be required to support the transition to the new business model may lead to dissatisfaction among employees which could make it more difficult for the Corporation to retain key employees;\n\u2022\nThe transition to the new business model may create operational and other challenges that are disruptive to the Corporation\u2019s business; and\n\u2022\nExpenses will be incurred in the implementation of the new business model and the implementation process may distract the Corporation from the achievement of other fundamental business objectives.\nThe Corporation may not be able to achieve its growth plans.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business plan includes the pursuit of profitable growth. Under current economic, competitive and regulatory conditions, profitable growth may be difficult to achieve due to one or more of the following factors:\n\u2022\nIn the current, prolonged low interest rate environment, the Corporation\u2019s net interest margin has been compressed and it is possible that a net interest margin that is lower than historical levels could continue for some time. As a result, income growth will likely need to come from growth in the volume of earning assets, particularly loans, and an increase in non-interest income. However, customer demand and competition could make such income growth difficult to achieve;\n\u2022\nIn recent years, reductions in the Corporation\u2019s provision for credit losses have had a significant favorable impact on the Corporation\u2019s earnings, in comparison to earlier years, during which credit losses and the provision for credit losses were elevated. Significant further reductions in the provision for loan losses are not likely;\n\u2022\nOperating expenses, particularly in the compliance and risk management areas, have been elevated and such expenses are unlikely to be reduced in the near future; and\n\u2022\nGrowth through acquisition or branching to supplement organic growth is unlikely to occur while the Regulatory Orders referenced above are in place, due to an inability to obtain the required regulatory approvals.\nThe competition the Corporation faces is significant and may reduce the Corporation's customer base and negatively impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nThere is significant competition among commercial banks in the market areas served by the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation also competes with other providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, the mutual funds industry, full service brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms, some of which are subject to less extensive regulations than the Corporation is with respect to the products and services they provide and have different cost structures. Some of the Corporation's competitors have greater resources, higher lending limits, lower cost of funds and may offer other services not offered by the Corporation. The Corporation also experiences competition from a variety of institutions outside its market areas. Some of these institutions conduct business primarily over the Internet and may thus be able to realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer.\nCompetition may adversely affect the rates the Corporation pays on deposits and charges on loans, thereby potentially adversely affecting the Corporation's profitability. The Corporation's profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in the market areas it serves. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business,\" \"Competition.\"\nIf the goodwill that the Corporation has recorded in connection with its acquisitions becomes impaired, it could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nIn the past, the Corporation supplemented its internal growth with strategic acquisitions of banks, branches and other financial services companies. If the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the company's net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer's balance sheet as goodwill. As of December 31, 2014, the Corporation had $530.6 million of goodwill recorded on its balance sheet. The Corporation is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. Write-downs of the amount of any impairment, if necessary, are to be charged to earnings in the period in which the impairment occurs. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in impairment charges.\nECONOMIC AND CREDIT RISKS.\nDifficult conditions in the economy and the capital markets may materially adversely affect the Corporation's business and results of operations.\nThe Corporation's results of operations and financial condition are affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally. The Corporation's financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Corporation operates and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or changes in interest rates, high unemployment, natural disasters or a combination of these or other factors.\nSpecifically, the business environment impacts the ability of borrowers to pay interest on, and repay principal of, outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services the Corporation offers. If the quality of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio declines, the Corporation may have to increase its provision for credit losses, which would negatively impact its results of operations, and could result in charge-offs of a higher percentage of its loans. Unlike large, national institutions, the Corporation is not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies and geographic locations. If the communities in which the Corporation operates do not grow, or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, its business could be adversely affected. In addition, increased market competition in a lower demand environment could adversely affect the profit potential of the Corporation.\nThe Corporation is subject to certain risks in connection with the establishment and level of its allowance for credit losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. While the Corporation believes that its allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2014 is sufficient to cover incurred losses in the loan portfolio on that date, the Corporation may be required to increase its provision for credit losses due to changes in the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, thereby negatively impacting its results of operations.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management\u2019s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. Management\u2019s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio is dependent on the proper application of its methodology for determining its allowance needs. The most critical judgments underpinning that methodology include: the ability to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner; proper collateral valuation of impaired\nloans evaluated for impairment; proper measurement of allowance needs for pools of loans measured for impairment; and an overall assessment of the risk profile of the loan portfolio.\nThe Corporation determines the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including, but not limited to: the size and composition of the loan portfolio; changes in risk ratings; changes in collateral values; delinquency levels; historical losses; and economic conditions. In addition, as the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio grows, it will generally be necessary to increase the allowance for credit losses through additional provisions, which would adversely impact the Corporation\u2019s operating results.\nIf the Corporation\u2019s assumptions and judgments regarding such matters prove to be inaccurate, its allowance for credit losses might not be sufficient, and additional provisions for credit losses might need to be made. Depending on the amount of such provisions for credit losses, the adverse impact of the Corporation\u2019s earnings could be material.\nFurthermore, banking regulators may require the Corporation to make additional provisions for credit losses or otherwise recognize further loan charge-offs or impairments following their periodic reviews of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio, underwriting procedures and allowance for credit losses. Any increase in the Corporation\u2019s allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by such regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" \"Financial Condition - Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses.\"\nEconomic downturns and the composition of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio subject the Corporation to credit risk.\nEconomic downturns and the composition of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio subject the Corporation to credit risk. National, regional and local economic conditions can impact the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio. For example, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or changes in interest rates, as well as other factors, such as a substantial decline in the stock market could weaken the economies of the communities the Corporation serves. Weakness in the market areas served by the Corporation may depress the Corporation\u2019s earnings and consequently its financial condition because:\n\u2022\nborrowers may not be able to pay interest on, and repay their principal of, outstanding loans;\n\u2022\nthe value of the collateral securing the Corporation's loans to borrowers may decline; and\n\u2022\ndemand for loans, as well as and other products and services the Corporation offers, may decline.\nApproximately $9.6 billion, or 73.3%, of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio was in commercial loans, commercial mortgage loans, and construction loans at December 31, 2014. Commercial loans, commercial mortgage loans and construction loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans and consumer loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on these loans often depend on the successful operation and management of businesses and properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate markets, adverse economic conditions or changes in government regulation. See Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" \"Financial Condition - Loans.\"\nPrice fluctuations in securities markets, as well as other market events, such as a disruption in credit and other markets and the abnormal functioning of markets for securities, could have an impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nThe market value of the Corporation's securities investments, which include municipal securities, auction rate securities, corporate debt securities and equity investments, as well as the revenues the Corporation earns from its trust and investment management services business, are particularly sensitive to price fluctuations and market events. Declines in the values of the Corporation\u2019s securities holdings, combined with adverse changes in the expected cash flows from these investments, could result in other-than-temporary impairment charges.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Corporation\u2019s securities investments included $100.9 million of investments in student loan auction rate certificates (ARCs). Following the failures of periodic auctions for these ARCs, which began in 2008 and have continued since that time, there has not been an active market for these securities. Other than sporadic redemptions and tender offers made by the issuers of these ARCs, these securities are illiquid. Secondary market transactions involving ARCs typically represent forced liquidations or distressed sales and do not provide an accurate basis for determining their fair value. The Corporation does not have the intent to sell the ARCs and does not believe it will more likely than not be required to sell any of the ARCs prior to a recovery of their fair value to amortized cost, which may be at maturity. However, if the Corporation chose to liquidate these securities prior to their maturity, it would likely have to do so at \"distressed\" sale prices and would likely do so at a loss.\nA portion of the Corporation's securities portfolio includes holdings of equity investments, including stocks of publicly traded financial institutions. The portfolio of publicly traded financial institutions includes shares of a single financial institution which, as of December 31, 2014, had a fair value of $30.4 million. The Corporation's holdings of this financial institution constituted approximately 72.7% of the fair value of the Corporation's aggregate holdings of publicly traded financial institutions as of that date.\nThe Corporation's investment management and trust services revenue, which is partially based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios, can also be impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets. If the values of those investment portfolios decrease, whether due to factors influencing U.S. securities markets, in general, or otherwise, the Corporation's revenue could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Corporation's ability to sell its brokerage services is dependent, in part, upon consumers' level of confidence in securities markets.\nSee also Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nOPERATIONAL RISKS.\nThe Corporation is exposed to many types of operational and other risks and the Corporation's framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk.\nThe Corporation is exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of human error or fraud by employees and outsiders, unsatisfactory performance by employees and vendors, clerical and record-keeping errors, computer and telecommunications systems malfunctions or failures and reliance on data that may be faulty or incomplete. In an environment characterized by continual, rapid technological change, as discussed below, when the Corporation introduces new products and services, or makes changes to its information technology systems and processes, these operational risks are increased. Any of these operational risks could result in the Corporation's diminished ability to operate one or more of its businesses, financial loss, potential liability to customers, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could materially adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk management framework is subject to inherent limitations, and there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Corporation has not anticipated or identified. If the Corporation's risk management framework proves to be ineffective, the Corporation could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. The Corporation\u2019s traditional super-community banking strategy challenges the Corporation's efforts to manage risk efficiently and effectively through a centralized risk management and compliance function.\nThe Corporation\u2019s operational risks include risks associated with third-party vendors and other financial institutions.\nThe Corporation relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain its day-to-day operations, including, notably, responsibility for the core processing system that services all of the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries. For example, the Corporation's businesses are dependent on its ability to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions; a significant amount of this processing is provided to the Corporation by third-party vendors. Accordingly, the Corporation\u2019s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements could be disruptive to the Corporation\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Further, third-party vendor risk management has become a point of regulatory emphasis recently. A failure of the Corporation to follow applicable regulatory guidance in this area could expose the Corporation to regulatory sanctions.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, execution of transactions or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This risk is sometimes referred to as \"systemic risk\" and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which the Corporation interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect the Corporation.\nAny of these operational or other risks could result in the Corporation's diminished ability to operate one or more of its businesses, financial loss, potential liability to customers, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could materially adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s internal controls may be ineffective.\nOne critical component of the Corporation\u2019s risk management framework is its system of internal controls. Management regularly reviews and updates the Corporation\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Corporation\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. See Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures.\"\nLoss of, or failure to adequately safeguard, confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect the Corporation's operations, net income or reputation.\nThe Corporation regularly collects, processes, transmits and stores significant amounts of its own confidential information, as well as confidential information regarding its customers, employees and others, that is necessary to the conduct of its business. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on behalf of the Corporation. A failure in or breach of the Corporation's operational or information security systems, or those of the Corporation's third-party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage the Corporation\u2019s reputation, increase the Corporation\u2019s costs and/or cause losses and could subject the Corporation to significant regulatory consequences. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect the Corporation's systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Corporation.\nThe safeguards employed by the Corporation do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, and that if mishandling, misuse or loss of the information did occur, those events will be promptly detected and addressed. As information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve (and possibly increase as technological developments may further increase cyber threats), the Corporation may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe Corporation\u2019s insurance includes coverage for so-called \"cyber security risks.\" However, in the event of a breach of data security, the amount of such coverage may prove to be inadequate. Further, such insurance includes deductibles and exclusions which may result in less than full coverage for losses incurred.\nThe Corporation continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Corporation\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Corporation\u2019s operations. Many of the Corporation\u2019s financial institution competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and new payment services developed and offered by non-financial institution competitors pose an increasing threat to the traditional payment services offered by financial institutions. The Corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers, or effectively deploy new technologies to improve the efficiency of its operations. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, the costs of new technology, including personnel, can be high in both absolute and relative terms. There can be no assurance, given the past pace of change and innovation, that the Corporation\u2019s technology, either purchased or developed internally, will meet or continue to meet the needs of the Corporation and the needs of its customers.\nThe Corporation may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Corporation\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain skilled people. Competition for talented personnel in most activities engaged in by the Corporation can be intense, and the Corporation may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of the Corporation\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business because of their skills, knowledge of the Corporation\u2019s markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nAs an example and as noted above, the Corporation is engaged in an effort to enhance its compliance and risk management functions. As many of the Corporation\u2019s peers are engaged in similar efforts, the competition for personnel with skills in these areas can be significant and, to the extent that the Corporation is able to attract qualified personnel, the expense associated with hiring and retaining such personnel may be substantial.\nRISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE CORPORATION\u2019S SECURITIES.\nThe Corporation's future growth may require the Corporation to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or may be available only at an excessive cost.\nThe Corporation is required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. In 2014, the Corporation issued subordinated debt intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes and the Corporation anticipates that current capital levels will satisfy regulatory requirements for the foreseeable future. The Corporation, however, may at some point choose to raise additional capital to support future growth. The Corporation's ability to raise additional capital will depend, in part, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of the Corporation's control. Accordingly, the Corporation may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to the Corporation, or at all. If the Corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to expand operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impacted. In the event of a material decrease in the Corporation's stock price, future issuances of equity securities could result in dilution of existing shareholder interests.\nCapital planning has taken on more importance due to regulatory requirements and the Basel III capital standards.\nConsistent with current regulatory guidance, the Corporation conducts an annual stress test using data as of September 30 of each year and different scenarios provided by the FRB, and reports the results of the stress test to the FRB by March 31 of the following year. Beginning with the results of the stress test reported to the FRB in March 2015, the Corporation will also be required to publicly disclose a summary of the results of the stress test completed under the severely adverse scenario. The Corporation's board of directors and its senior management are required to consider the results of the stress test in the normal course of business, including as part of its capital planning process and the evaluation of the adequacy of its capital. The results of the stress testing process may lead the Corporation to retain additional capital or alter the mix of its capital components. In addition, the implementation of certain regulations with regard to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Corporation's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those who may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements.\nIn 2013, the federal banking regulatory agencies implemented the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules, including: (i) new minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50% of risk-weighted assets, (ii) increased minimum Tier 1 capital ratio (from 4.00% to 6.00% of risk-weighted assets), (iii) retention of the current minimum Total capital ratio of 8.00% of risk-weighted assets and the minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio at 4.00% of average assets and (iv) a new \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.50% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements which must be maintained to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments. As a result of the implementation of the new capital standards, certain non-qualifying capital instruments, including cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities, will be excluded as a component of Tier 1 capital for institutions of the Corporation\u2019s size and included in Tier 2 capital.\nThe fully phased-in capital standards under the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules require banks to maintain more capital than the minimum levels required under current regulatory capital standards. The new minimum regulatory capital requirements begin to apply to the Corporation on January 1, 2015. The required minimum capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally starting on January 1, 2016 and will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. The failure to meet the established capital requirements could result in the federal banking regulators placing limitations or conditions on the activities of the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries or restricting the commencement of new activities, and such failure could subject the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries to a variety of enforcement remedies, including limiting the ability of the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries to pay dividends, issuing a directive to increase capital and terminating FDIC deposit insurance. In addition, the failure to comply with the capital conservation buffer will result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. As of December 31, 2014, the Corporation believes its current capital levels would meet the fully-phased in minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffers, as set forth in the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business,\" \"Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements.\"\nThe Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for substantially all of its revenue and its ability to make dividends, distributions and other payments.\nThe Corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries, and depends on the payment of dividends from its subsidiaries, principally its banking subsidiaries, for substantially all of its revenues. As a result, the\nCorporation's ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on certain federal and state regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. There are various regulatory and prudential supervisory restrictions, which may change from time to time, that impact the ability of the Corporation\u2019s banking subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to it. There can be no assurance that the Corporation\u2019s banking subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends at past levels, or at all, in the future. If the Corporation does not receive sufficient cash dividends or is unable to borrow from its banking subsidiaries, then the Corporation may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends to its shareholders, repurchase its common stock or service its debt obligations. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business,\" \"Supervision and Regulation - Loans and Dividends from Subsidiary Banks.\"\nIn addition, as noted above, liquidity and capital planning at both the bank and holding company levels has become an area of increased regulatory emphasis. In recent years, the Corporation has pursued a strategy of capital management under which it has sought to deploy its capital, through stock repurchases, increased regular dividends and special dividends, in a manner that is beneficial to the Corporation\u2019s shareholders. This capital management strategy is subject to regulatory supervision.\nA downgrade in the credit ratings of the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.\nFitch, Inc. and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. continuously evaluate the Corporation and its subsidiaries, and their ratings of the Corporation and its subsidiary's long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not entirely within its and its subsidiaries' control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Moreover, Fitch and Moody's have indicated that they are evaluating the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the rating support assumptions currently included in their methodologies. In light of these reviews and the continued focus on the financial services industry generally, the Corporation and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings. Ratings downgrades by Fitch or Moody's could have a significant and immediate impact on the Corporation's funding and liquidity through cash obligations, reduced funding capacity and collateral triggers. A reduction in the Corporation's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could also increase the Corporation's borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.\nDowngrades in the credit or financial strength ratings assigned to the counterparties with whom the Corporation transacts, could create the perception that the Corporation's financial condition will be adversely impacted as a result of potential future defaults by such counterparties. Additionally, the Corporation could be adversely affected by a general, negative perception of financial institutions caused by the downgrade of other financial institutions. Accordingly, ratings downgrades for other financial institutions could affect the market price of the Corporation's stock and could limit access to or increase its cost of capital.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact the Corporation's shareholders.\nProvisions of banking laws, Pennsylvania corporate law and of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Corporation or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of the Corporation. To the extent that these provisions discourage such a transaction, holders of the Corporation's common stock may not have an opportunity to dispose of part or all of their stock at a higher price than that prevailing in the market. These provisions may also adversely affect the market price of the Corporation\u2019s stock. In addition, some of these provisions make it more difficult to remove, and thereby may serve to entrench, the Corporation's incumbent directors and officers, even if their removal would be regarded by some shareholders as desirable.\nCertain provisions of Pennsylvania corporate law applicable to the Corporation\u2019s and the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions which may be considered to be \"anti-takeover\" in nature because they may have the effect of discouraging or making more difficult the acquisition of control of the Corporation by means of a hostile tender offer, exchange offer, proxy contest or similar transaction. These provisions are intended to protect the Corporation's shareholders by providing a measure of assurance that the Corporation's shareholders will be treated fairly in the event of an unsolicited takeover bid and by preventing a successful takeover bidder from exercising its voting control to the detriment of the other shareholders. However, the anti-takeover provisions set forth in the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, taken as a whole, may discourage a hostile tender offer, exchange offer, proxy solicitation or similar transaction relating to the Corporation's common stock.\nThe ability of a third party to acquire the Corporation is also limited under applicable banking regulations. The BHCA requires any \"bank holding company\" (as defined in that Act) to obtain the approval of the FRB prior to acquiring more than 5% of the Corporation\u2019s outstanding common stock. Any person other than a bank holding company is required to obtain prior approval of the FRB to acquire 10% or more of the Corporation\u2019s outstanding common stock under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 and, under certain circumstances, such approvals are required at an even lower ownership percentage. Any holder of 25% or more of the Corporation\u2019s outstanding common stock, other than an individual, is subject to regulation as a bank holding company under\nthe BHCA. In addition, the delays associated with obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for acquisitions of interests in bank holding companies also tend to make more difficult certain acquisition structures, such as a tender offer. While these provisions do not prohibit an acquisition, they would likely act as a deterrent factor to an unsolicited takeover attempt.", "PERMNO": 88197, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FULT"}
