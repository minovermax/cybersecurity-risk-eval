{"cik": "1670592", "company": "YETI Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. These risks include, but are not limited to, those material risks described below, each of which may be relevant to an investment decision. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Report, including, but not limited to, the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. Our business, financial condition, and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including, but not limited to, those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price. If any of the following risks or other risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and future prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business depends on maintaining and strengthening our brand to generate and maintain ongoing demand for our products, and a significant reduction in such demand could harm our results of operations.\nThe YETI name and premium brand image are integral to the growth of our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Our success depends on the value and reputation of our brand, which, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality, design, performance, functionality, and durability of our products, the image of our e-commerce platform and retail partner floor spaces, our communication activities, including advertising, social media, and public relations, and our management of the customer experience, including direct interfaces through customer service. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand are important to expanding our customer base, and will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer experiences. We intend to continue making substantial investments in these areas in order to maintain and enhance our brand, and such investments may not be successful. Ineffective marketing, negative publicity, product diversion to unauthorized distribution channels, product or manufacturing defects, counterfeit products, unfair labor practices, and failure to protect the intellectual property rights in our brand are some of the potential threats to the strength of our brand, and those and other factors could rapidly and severely diminish customer confidence in us. Furthermore, these factors could cause our customers to lose the personal connection they feel with the YETI brand. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand image in our current markets and in new markets where we have limited brand recognition is important to expanding our customer base. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand in current or new markets, our growth strategy and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to successfully design, develop and market new products, our business may be harmed.\nTo maintain and increase sales, we must continue to introduce new products on a timely basis to respond to new and evolving consumer preferences and improve or enhance our existing products. The success of our new and enhanced products depends on many factors, including anticipating consumer preferences, finding innovative solutions to consumer problems, differentiating our products from those of our competitors, and maintaining the strength of our brand. The design and development of our products is costly, and we typically have several products in development at the same time. Problems in the design or quality of our products, or delays in product introduction, may harm our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any new products that we develop and market may not generate sufficient revenues to recoup their development, production, marketing, selling and other costs.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate.\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate. Forecasts may be particularly challenging as we expand into new markets and geographies and develop and market new products. Our historical sales, expense levels, and profitability may not be an appropriate basis for forecasting future results.\nFailure to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate could cause us to make poor operating decisions and we may not be able to adjust in a timely manner. Consequently, actual results could be materially lower than anticipated. Even if the markets in which we compete expand, we cannot assure you that our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth.\nAs we grow our business, slower growing or reduced demand for our products, increased competition, a decrease in the growth rate of our overall market, failure to develop and successfully market new products, or the maturation of our business or market could harm our business. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development and sales and marketing organizations, expand our operations and infrastructure both domestically and internationally, design and develop new products, and enhance our existing products. In addition, in connection with operating as a public company, we will incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. If our sales do not increase at a sufficient rate to offset these increases in our operating expenses, our profitability may decline in future periods.\nWe have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception. Our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased substantially over the past several years. We have only a limited history operating our business at its current scale. Our management team does not have substantial tenure working together. Consequently, if our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in managing this growth and building the appropriate processes and controls. Continued growth may increase the strain on our resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including difficulties in sourcing, logistics, recruiting, maintaining internal controls, marketing, designing innovative products, and meeting consumer needs. If we do not adapt to meet these evolving challenges, the strength of our brand may erode, the quality of our products may suffer, we may not be able to deliver products on a timely basis to our customers, and our corporate culture may be harmed.\nOur marketing strategy of associating our brand and products with activities rooted in passion for the outdoors may not be successful with existing and future customers.\nWe believe that we have been successful in marketing our products by associating our brand and products with activities rooted in passion for the outdoors. To sustain long-term growth, we must continue to successfully promote our products to consumers who identify with or aspire to these activities, as well as to individuals who simply value products of uncompromising quality and design. If we fail to continue to successfully market and sell our products to our existing customers or expand our customer base, our sales could decline, or we may be unable to grow our business.\nIf we fail to attract new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, we may not be able to increase sales.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract customers in a cost-effective manner. In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to and attract customers ranging from serious outdoor enthusiasts to individuals who simply value products of uncompromising quality and design. We have made, and we expect that we will continue to make, significant investments in attracting new customers, including through the use of corporate partnerships, YETI Ambassadors, traditional, digital, and social media, original YETI films, and participation in, and sponsorship of, community events. Marketing campaigns can be expensive and may not result in the cost-effective acquisition of customers. Further, as our brand becomes more widely known, future marketing campaigns may not attract new customers at the same rate as past campaigns. If we are unable to attract new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business will be harmed.\nOur growth depends, in part, on expanding into additional consumer markets, and we may not be successful in doing so.\nWe believe that our future growth depends not only on continuing to reach our current core demographic, but also continuing to broaden our retail partner and customer base. The growth of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to expand our retail partner and customer bases in the United States, as well as in international markets, including Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan. In these markets, we may face challenges that are different from those we currently encounter, including competitive, merchandising, distribution, hiring, and other difficulties. We may also encounter difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of consumer familiarity with or acceptance of our brand, or a resistance to paying for premium products, particularly in international markets. We continue to evaluate marketing efforts and other strategies to expand the customer base for our products. In addition, although we are investing in sales and marketing activities to further penetrate newer regions, including expansion of our dedicated sales force, we cannot assure you that we will be successful. If we are not successful, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur net sales and profits depend on the level of customer spending for our products, which is sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors; during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability, and financial condition.\nOur products are discretionary items for customers. Therefore, the success of our business depends significantly on economic factors and trends in consumer spending. There are a number of factors that influence consumer spending, including actual and perceived economic conditions, consumer confidence, disposable consumer income, consumer credit availability, unemployment, and tax rates in the markets where we sell our products. Consumers also have discretion as to where to spend their disposable income and may choose to purchase other items or services if we do not continue to provide authentic, compelling, and high-quality products at appropriate price points. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile and economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to declines. Any of these factors could harm discretionary consumer spending, resulting in a reduction in demand for our premium products, decreased prices, and harm to our business and results of operations. Moreover, consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may slow our growth more than we anticipate. A downturn in the economies in markets in which we sell our products, particularly in the United States, may materially harm our sales, profitability, and financial condition.\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive and include numerous other brands and retailers that offer a wide variety of products that compete with our products; if we fail to compete effectively, we could lose our market position.\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive, with low barriers to entry. Numerous other brands and retailers offer a wide variety of products that compete with our coolers, drinkware, and other products, including our bags, storage, and outdoor lifestyle products and accessories. Competition in these product markets is based on a number of factors including product quality, performance, durability, styling, brand image and recognition, and price. We believe that we are one of the market leaders in both the U.S. premium cooler and U.S. premium stainless-steel drinkware markets. We believe that we have been able to compete successfully largely on the basis of our brand, superior design capabilities, and product development, as well as on the breadth of our independent retailers, national, and regional retail partners, and growing DTC channel. Our competitors may be able to develop and market higher quality products that compete with our products, sell their products for lower prices, adapt to changes in consumers\u2019 needs and preferences more quickly, devote greater resources to the design, sourcing, distribution, marketing, and sale of their products, or generate greater brand recognition than us. In addition, as we expand into new product categories, we have faced, and will continue to face, different and, in some cases, more formidable competition. We believe many of our competitors and potential competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, ability to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products, global product distribution, larger and broader retailer bases, more established relationships with a larger number of suppliers and manufacturing partners, greater brand recognition, larger or more effective brand ambassador and endorsement relationships, greater financial strength, larger research and development teams, larger marketing budgets, and more distribution and other resources than we do. Some of our competitors may aggressively discount their products or offer other attractive sales terms in order to gain market share, which could result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, or lost market share. If we are not able to overcome these potential competitive challenges, effectively market our current and future products, and otherwise compete effectively against our current or potential competitors, our prospects, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\nCompetitors have attempted, and will likely continue to attempt, to imitate our products and technology. If we are unable to protect or preserve our brand image and proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nAs our business continues to expand, our competitors have imitated or attempted to imitate, and will likely continue to imitate or attempt to imitate, our product designs and branding, which could harm our business and results of operations. Only a portion of the intellectual property used in the manufacture and design of our products is patented, and we therefore rely significantly on trade secrets, trade and service marks, trade dress, and the strength of our brand. We regard our patents, trade dress, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and similar proprietary rights as critical to our success. We also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, suppliers, manufacturers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights against infringement or other violation may be inadequate, and we may experience difficulty in effectively limiting the unauthorized use of our patents, trademarks, trade dress, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights worldwide. We also cannot guarantee that others will not independently develop technology with the same or similar function to any proprietary technology we rely on to conduct our business and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Because a significant portion of our products are manufactured overseas in countries where counterfeiting is more prevalent, and we intend to increase our sales overseas over the long term, we may experience increased counterfeiting of our products. Unauthorized use or invalidation of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade dress, trade secrets, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights may cause significant damage to our brand and harm our results of operations.\nWhile we actively develop and protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected in all countries in which we conduct our business or that we will prevail when defending our patent, trademark, and proprietary rights. Additionally, we could incur significant costs and management distraction in pursuing claims to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation and defending any alleged counterclaims. If we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our patents, trade dress, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights for any reason, or if we fail to maintain our brand image due to actual or perceived product or service quality issues, adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, or other reasons, our brand and reputation could be damaged, and our business may be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers, and problems with, or loss of, our suppliers or an inability to obtain raw materials could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur products are produced by third-party contract manufacturers. We face the risk that these third-party contract manufacturers may not produce and deliver our products on a timely basis or at all. We have experienced, and will likely continue to experience, operational difficulties with our manufacturers. These difficulties include reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications and regulatory and customer requirements, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, failure to achieve our product quality standards, increases in costs of materials, and manufacturing or other business interruptions. The ability of our manufacturers to effectively satisfy our production requirements could also be impacted by manufacturer financial difficulty or damage to their operations caused by fire, terrorist attack, natural disaster, or other events. The failure of any manufacturer to perform to our expectations could result in supply shortages or delays for certain products and harm our business. If we experience significantly increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing manufacturer due to lack of performance, we may be unable to supplement or replace our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or on terms that are acceptable to us, which may increase our costs, reduce our margins, and harm our ability to deliver our products on time. For certain of our products, it may take a significant amount of time to identify and qualify a manufacturer that has the capability and resources to produce our products to our specifications in sufficient volume and satisfy our service and quality control standards.\nThe capacity of our manufacturers to produce our products is also dependent upon the availability of raw materials. Our manufacturers may not be able to obtain sufficient supply of raw materials, which could result in delays in deliveries of our products by our manufacturers or increased costs. Any shortage of raw materials or inability of a manufacturer to produce or ship our products in a timely manner, or at all, could impair our ability to ship orders of our products in a cost-efficient, timely manner and could cause us to miss the delivery requirements of our customers. As a result, we could experience cancellations of orders, refusals to accept deliveries, or reductions in our prices and margins, any of which could harm our financial performance, reputation, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to timely and effectively obtain shipments of products from our manufacturers and deliver products to our retail partners and customers, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. However, we cannot control all of the factors that might affect the timely and effective procurement of our products from our third-party contract manufacturers and the delivery of our products to our retail partners and customers.\nOur third-party contract manufacturers ship most of our products to our distribution centers in Dallas, Texas, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Our reliance on only two geographical locations for our distribution centers makes us more vulnerable to natural disasters, weather-related disruptions, accidents, system failures, or other unforeseen events that could delay or impair our ability to fulfill retailer orders and/or ship merchandise purchased on our website, which could harm our sales. We import our products, and we are also vulnerable to risks associated with products manufactured abroad, including, among other things: (a) risks of damage, destruction, or confiscation of products while in transit to our distribution centers; and (b) transportation and other delays in shipments, including as a result of heightened security screening, port congestion, and inspection processes or other port-of-entry limitations or restrictions in the United States. In order to meet demand for a product, we have chosen in the past, and may choose in the future, to arrange for additional quantities of the product, if available, to be delivered through air freight, which is significantly more expensive than standard shipping by sea and, consequently, could harm our gross margins. Failure to procure our products from our third-party contract manufacturers and deliver merchandise to our retail partners and DTC channel in a timely, effective, and economically viable manner could reduce our sales and gross margins, damage our brand, and harm our business.\nWe also rely on the timely and free flow of goods through open and operational ports from our suppliers and manufacturers. Labor disputes or disruptions at ports, our common carriers, or our suppliers or manufacturers could create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes, or other disruptions during periods of significant importing or manufacturing, potentially resulting in delayed or canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages, and harm to our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, we rely upon independent land-based and air freight carriers for product shipments from our distribution centers to our retail partners and customers who purchase through our DTC channel. We may not be able to obtain sufficient freight capacity on a timely basis or at favorable shipping rates and, therefore, may not be able to receive products from suppliers or deliver products to retail partners or customers in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nAccordingly, we are subject to the risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activity, inclement weather, and increased transportation costs, associated with our third-party contract manufacturers\u2019 and carriers\u2019 ability to provide products and services to meet our requirements. In addition, if the cost of fuel rises, the cost to deliver products may rise, which could harm our profitability.\nOur business is subject to the risk of manufacturer concentrations.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for the sourcing of our products. For our hard coolers, soft coolers, Drinkware, and bags, our two largest manufacturers comprised approximately 90%, 48%, 81%, and 79%, respectively, of our production volume during 2019. For our cargo, outdoor living, and pets products, two manufacturers accounted for all of the production of each product in 2019. As a result of this concentration in our supply chain, our business and operations would be negatively affected if any of our key manufacturers were to experience significant disruption affecting the price, quality, availability, or timely delivery of products. Our manufacturers could also be acquired by our competitors and may become our direct competitors, thus limiting or eliminating our access to manufacturing capacity. The partial or complete loss of our key manufacturers, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with any of these manufacturers, could result in lost sales, added costs, and distribution delays that could harm our business and customer relationships.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: (a) an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; (b) our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; (c) product introductions by competitors; (d) unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders or at-once orders placed by retailers; (e) the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; (f) weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and (g) terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials.\nInventory levels in excess of customer demand, including Drinkware inventory that we have added in preparation for recently enacted tariffs or that we may add in preparation for tariffs in the future, may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or in less preferred distribution channels, which could impair our brand image and harm our gross margin. In addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, lost sales, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships.\nThe difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability or cause us not to achieve our expected financial results.\nOur business could be harmed if we fail to execute our internal plans to transition our supply chain and certain other business processes to a global scale.\nWe are in the process of re-engineering certain of our supply chain management processes, as well as certain other business processes, to support our expanding scale. This expansion to a global scale requires significant investment of capital and human resources, the re-engineering of many business processes, and the attention of many managers and other employees who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. If our globalization efforts fail to produce planned efficiencies, or the transition is not managed effectively, we may experience excess inventories, inventory shortage, late deliveries, lost sales, or increased costs. Any business disruption arising from our globalization efforts, or our failure to effectively execute our internal plans for globalization, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on pricing.\nOur industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and customers or engage in more promotional activity than we anticipate, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. This could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, ongoing and sustained promotional activities could harm our brand image.\nWe rely on a series of purchase orders with our manufacturers. Some of these relationships are not exclusive, which means that these manufacturers could produce similar products for our competitors.\nWe rely on a series of purchase orders with our manufacturers. With all of our manufacturers, we face the risk that they may fail to produce and deliver our products on a timely basis, or at all, or comply with our quality standards. In addition, our manufacturers may raise prices in the future, which would increase our costs and harm our margins. Even those manufacturers with whom we have purchase orders may breach these agreements, and we may not be able to enforce our rights under these agreements or may incur significant costs attempting to do so. As a result, we cannot predict with certainty our ability to obtain finished products in adequate quantities, of required quality and at acceptable prices from our manufacturers in the future. Any one of these risks could harm our ability to deliver our products on time, or at all, damage our reputation and our relationships with our retail partners and customers, and increase our product costs thereby reducing our margins.\nIn addition, except in some of the situations where we have a supply contract, our arrangements with our manufacturers are not exclusive. As a result, our manufacturers could produce similar products for our competitors, some of which could potentially purchase products in significantly greater volume. Further, while certain of our long-term contracts stipulate contractual exclusivity, those manufacturers could choose to breach our agreements and work with our competitors. Our competitors could enter into restrictive or exclusive arrangements with our manufacturers that could impair or eliminate our access to manufacturing capacity or supplies.\nFluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, equipment, labor, and transportation could cause manufacturing delays or increase our costs.\nThe price and availability of key components used to manufacture our products, including polyethylene, polyurethane foam, stainless-steel, polyester fabric, zippers, and other plastic materials and coatings, as well as manufacturing equipment and molds, may fluctuate significantly. In addition, the cost of labor at our third-party contract manufacturers could increase significantly. For example, manufacturers in China have experienced increased costs in recent years due to shortages of labor and fluctuations of the Chinese yuan in relation to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the cost of logistics and transportation fluctuates in large part due to the price of oil. Any fluctuations in the cost and availability of any of our raw materials or other sourcing or transportation costs related to our raw materials or products could harm our gross margins and our ability to meet customer demand. If we are unable to successfully mitigate a significant portion of these product cost increases or fluctuations, our results of operations could be harmed.\nMany of our products are manufactured by third parties outside of the United States, and our business may be harmed by legal, regulatory, economic, political and public health risks associated with international trade and those markets.\nMany of our core products are manufactured in China, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan. In addition, we have third-party manufacturing partners in Mexico and Italy. Our reliance on suppliers and manufacturers in foreign markets creates risks inherent in doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including: (a) the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including trade and labor restrictions and laws relating to the importation and taxation of goods; (b) weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States, and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States; (c) compliance with U.S. and foreign laws relating to foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the UK Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cBribery Act\u201d), regulations of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Controls (\u201cOFAC\u201d), and U.S. anti-money laundering regulations, which respectively prohibit U.S. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, operating in certain countries, or maintaining business relationships with certain restricted parties as well as engaging in other corrupt and illegal practices; (d) economic and political instability and acts of terrorism in the countries where our suppliers are located; (e) public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, in the countries where our suppliers and manufacturers are located; (f) transportation interruptions or increases in transportation costs; and (g) the imposition of tariffs or non-tariff barriers on components and products that we import into the United States or other markets. For example, the ongoing coronavirus outbreak emanating from China at the beginning of 2020 has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region. This public health crises or any further political developments or health concerns in markets in which our products are manufactured could result in social, economic and labor instability, adversely affecting the supply of our products and, in turn, our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, we cannot assure you that our directors, officers, employees, representatives, manufacturers, or suppliers have not engaged and will not engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible, nor can we assure you that our manufacturers, suppliers, or other business partners have not engaged and will not engage in conduct that could materially harm their ability to perform their contractual obligations to us or even result in our being held liable for such conduct. Violations of the FCPA, the Bribery Act, OFAC restrictions, or other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and anti-terrorism laws or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil penalties, and we may be subject to other related liabilities, which could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nAs current tariffs are implemented, or if additional tariffs or other restrictions are placed on foreign imports or any related counter-measures are taken by other countries, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe Trump Administration has put into place tariffs and other trade restrictions and signaled that it may additionally alter trade agreements and terms between the United States and China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, among others, including limiting trade and/or imposing tariffs on imports from such countries. In addition, China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, among others, have either threatened or put into place retaliatory tariffs of their own. As announced tariffs are implemented, or additional tariffs or other restrictions are placed on foreign imports, including on any of our products manufactured overseas for sale in the United States, or any related counter-measures are taken by other countries, our business and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nCurrent and additional tariffs have the potential to significantly raise the cost of our products, particularly our Drinkware. In such a case, there can be no assurance that we will be able to shift manufacturing and supply agreements to non-impacted countries, including the United States, to reduce the effects of the tariffs. As a result, we may suffer margin erosion or be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers, negatively impact our results of operations, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the imposition of tariffs on products that we export to international markets could make such products more expensive compared to those of our competitors if we pass related additional costs on to our customers, which may also result in the loss of customers, negatively impact our results of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\nA significant portion of our sales are to independent retail partners.\nFor 2018 and 2019, approximately 22% and 18%, respectively, of our gross sales were made to independent retail partners. These retail partners may decide to emphasize products from our competitors, to redeploy their retail floor space to other product categories, or to take other actions that reduce their purchases of our products. We do not receive long-term purchase commitments from our independent retail partners, and orders received from our independent retail partners are cancellable. Factors that could affect our ability to maintain or expand our sales to these independent retail partners include: (a) failure to accurately identify the needs of our customers; (b) a lack of customer acceptance of new products or product expansions; (c) unwillingness of our independent retail partners and customers to attribute premium value to our new or existing products or product expansions relative to competing products; (d) failure to obtain shelf space from our retail partners; (e) new, well-received product introductions by competitors; and (f) damage to our relationships with independent retail partners due to brand or reputational harm.\nWe cannot assure you that our independent retail partners will continue to carry our current products or carry any new products that we develop. If these risks occur, they could harm our brand as well as our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our retail partners to display and present our products to customers, and our failure to maintain and further develop our relationships with our retail partners could harm our business.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products through knowledgeable national, regional, and independent retail partners. Our retail partners service customers by stocking and displaying our products, explaining our product attributes, and sharing our brand story. Our relationships with these retail partners are important to the authenticity of our brand and the marketing programs we continue to deploy. Our failure to maintain these relationships with our retail partners or financial difficulties experienced by these retail partners could harm our business.\nWe have key relationships with national retail partners. For both 2018 and 2019, one national retail partner, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, accounted for approximately 16% and 15% of our gross sales, respectively. If we lose any of our key retail partners or any key retail partner reduces its purchases of our existing or new products or its number of stores or operations or promotes products of our competitors over ours, our sales would be harmed. Because we are a premium brand, our sales depend, in part, on retail partners effectively displaying our products, including providing attractive space and point of purchase displays in their stores, and training their sales personnel to sell our products. If our retail partners reduce or terminate those activities, we may experience reduced sales of our products, resulting in lower gross margins, which would harm our results of operations.\nIf our plans to increase sales through our DTC channel are not successful, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nFor 2019, our DTC channel accounted for 42% of our net sales. Part of our growth strategy involves increasing sales through our DTC channel. However, we have limited operating experience executing the retail component of this strategy. The level of customer traffic and volume of customer purchases through our country and region-specific YETI websites or other e-commerce initiatives are substantially dependent on our ability to provide a content-rich and user-friendly website, a hassle-free customer experience, sufficient product availability, and reliable, timely delivery of our products. If we are unable to maintain and increase customers\u2019 use of our website, allocate sufficient product to our website, and increase any sales through our website, our business, and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe currently have a limited number of country and region-specific YETI websites and are planning to expand our e-commerce platform to others. These countries may impose different and evolving laws governing the operation and marketing of e-commerce websites, as well as the collection, storage, and use of information on customers interacting with those websites. We may incur additional costs and operational challenges in complying with these laws, and differences in these laws may cause us to operate our business differently, and less effectively, in different territories. If so, we may incur additional costs and may not fully realize the investment in our international expansion.\nIf we do not successfully implement our future retail store expansion, our growth and profitability could be harmed.\nWe have and may continue to expand our existing DTC channel by opening new retail and pop-up stores. We opened retail stores in Charleston, South Carolina, and Chicago, Illinois, in June 2019 and September 2019, respectively, and we plan to open additional stores, including a store in Denver, Colorado, in 2020. Additionally, we opened a pop-up store in each of Austin, Texas, and Dallas, Texas, in October 2019 and November 2019, respectively. Our ability to open new retail stores in a timely manner and operate them profitably depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022our ability to manage the financial and operational aspects of our retail growth strategy, including making appropriate investments in our software systems, information technology, and operational infrastructure;\n\u2022our ability to identify suitable locations, including our ability to gather and assess demographic and marketing data to accurately determine customer demand for our products in the locations we select;\n\u2022our ability to negotiate favorable lease agreements;\n\u2022our ability to properly assess the potential profitability and payback period of potential new retail store locations;\n\u2022the availability of financing on favorable terms;\n\u2022our ability to secure required governmental permits and approvals and our ability to effectively comply with state and local employment and labor laws, rules, and regulations;\n\u2022our ability to hire and train skilled store operating personnel, especially management personnel;\n\u2022the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction delays or cost overruns;\n\u2022our ability to provide a satisfactory mix of merchandise that is responsive to the needs of our customers living in the areas where new retail stores are established;\n\u2022our ability to establish a supplier and distribution network able to supply new retail stores with inventory in a timely manner;\n\u2022our competitors, or our retail partners, building or leasing stores near our retail stores or in locations we have identified as targets for a new retail store;\n\u2022customer demand for our products; and\n\u2022general economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending and the overall strength of our business.\nWe currently have three retail stores, two pop-up stores, and a corporate store and, therefore, have limited experience in opening retail stores and may not be able to successfully address the risks that they entail. For example, we may not be able to implement our retail store strategy, achieve desired net sales growth, and payback periods or maintain consistent levels of profitability in our retail stores. In order to pursue our retail store strategy, we will be required to expend significant cash resources prior to generating any sales in these stores. We may not generate sufficient sales from these stores to justify these expenses, which could harm our business and profitability. The substantial management time and resources, which any future retail store expansion strategy may require, could also result in disruption to our existing business operations, which may decrease our net sales and profitability.\nInsolvency, credit problems or other financial difficulties that could confront our retail partners could expose us to financial risk.\nWe sell to the large majority of our retail partners on open account terms and do not require collateral or a security interest in the inventory we sell them. Consequently, our accounts receivable with our retail partners are unsecured. Insolvency, credit problems, or other financial difficulties confronting our retail partners could expose us to financial risk. These actions could expose us to risks if they are unable to pay for the products they purchase from us. Financial difficulties of our retail partners could also cause them to reduce their sales staff, use of attractive displays, number or size of stores, and the amount of floor space dedicated to our products. Any reduction in sales by, or loss of, our current retail partners or customer demand, or credit risks associated with our retail partners, could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf our independent suppliers and manufacturing partners do not comply with ethical business practices or with applicable laws and regulations, our reputation, business, and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur reputation and our customers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products depend in part on our suppliers\u2019, manufacturers\u2019, and retail partners\u2019 compliance with ethical employment practices, such as with respect to child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, safe and healthy working conditions, and with all legal and regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of their businesses. We do not exercise control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and retail partners and cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical and lawful business practices. If our suppliers, manufacturers, or retail partners fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, safety codes, employment practices, human rights standards, quality standards, environmental standards, production practices, or other obligations, norms, or ethical standards, our reputation and brand image could be harmed, and we could be exposed to litigation and additional costs that would harm our business, reputation, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks.\nFor our DTC sales, as well as for sales to certain retail partners, we accept a variety of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, electronic funds transfers, electronic payment systems, and gift cards. Accordingly, we are, and will continue to be, subject to significant and evolving regulations and compliance requirements, including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in increased costs and liability, and reduce the ease of use of certain payment methods. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, as well as electronic payment systems, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time. We rely on independent service providers for payment processing, including credit and debit cards. If these independent service providers become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us, or if the cost of using these providers increases, our business could be harmed. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and agreements, including data security rules and agreements, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for losses incurred by card issuing banks or customers, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, lose our ability to accept credit or debit card payments from our customers, or process electronic fund transfers or facilitate other types of payments. Any failure to comply could significantly harm our brand, reputation, business, and results of operations.\nOur future success depends on the continuing efforts of our management and key employees, and on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and senior management.\nWe depend on the talents and continued efforts of our senior management and key employees. The loss of members of our management or key employees may disrupt our business and harm our results of operations. Furthermore, our ability to manage further expansion will require us to continue to attract, motivate, and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for this type of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting, integrating, and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business effectively. There can be no assurance that our current management team or any new members of our management team will be able to successfully execute our business and operating strategies.\nOur plans for international expansion may not be successful; our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may make it more difficult to execute our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nContinued expansion into markets outside the United States, including Canada, Australia, Europe and Japan, is one of our key long-term strategies for the future growth of our business. There are, however, significant costs and risks inherent in selling our products in international markets, including: (a) failure to effectively translate and establish our core brand identity, particularly in markets with a less-established heritage of outdoor and recreational activities; (b) time and difficulty in building a widespread network of retail partners; (c) increased shipping and distribution costs, which could increase our expenses and reduce our margins; (d) potentially lower margins in some regions; (e) longer collection cycles in some regions; (f) increased competition from local providers of similar products; (g) compliance with foreign laws and regulations, including taxes and duties, enhanced privacy laws, rules, and regulations, and product liability laws, rules, and regulations, particularly in the European Union; (h) establishing and maintaining effective internal controls at foreign locations and the associated increased costs; (i) increased counterfeiting and the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing rights abroad; (j) compliance with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws, such as the FCPA, the Bribery Act, and OFAC regulations, by us, our employees, and our business partners; (k) currency exchange rate fluctuations and related effects on our results of operations; (l) economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in foreign economies and markets; (m) compliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; (n) workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; (o) business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and fires, or public health issues, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the novel coronavirus; (p) the imposition of tariffs on products that we import into international markets that could make such products more expensive compared to those of our competitors; (q) that our ability to expand internationally could be impacted by the intellectual property rights of third parties that conflict with or are superior to ours; and (r) other costs and risks of doing business internationally.\nThese and other factors could harm our international operations and, consequently, harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, we may incur significant operating expenses as a result of our planned international expansion, and it may not be successful. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in new markets. We also have limited operating experience outside of the United States and in our expansion efforts we may encounter obstacles we did not face in the United States, including cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments, and preferences of foreign customers. Consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends, may differ internationally, and, as a result, sales of our products may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we anticipate. We may also encounter difficulty expanding into international markets because of limited brand recognition, leading to delayed or limited acceptance of our products by customers in these markets and increased marketing and customer acquisition costs to establish our brand. Accordingly, if we are unable to successfully expand internationally or manage the complexity of our global operations, we may not achieve the expected benefits of this expansion and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur financial results and future growth could be harmed by currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAs our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the United States are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into U.S. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. Similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. In addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. As a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur current and future products may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in negative publicity, litigation, product recalls, and warranty claims, which could result in decreased sales and operating margin, and harm to our brand.\nAlthough we extensively and rigorously test new and enhanced products, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all defects. Defects in materials or components can unexpectedly interfere with the products\u2019 intended use and safety and damage our reputation. Failure to detect, prevent, or fix defects could result in a variety of consequences, including a greater number of product returns than expected from customers and our retail partners, litigation, product recalls, and credit claims, among others, which could harm our sales and results of operations. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in our current and future products could expose us to product recalls, warranty, or other claims. In addition, any negative publicity or lawsuits filed against us related to the perceived quality and safety of our products could also harm our brand and decrease demand for our products.\nOur business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by problems such as terrorism, cyberattacks, or failure of key information technology systems.\nOur business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, criminal acts, and similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our corporate offices, one of our distribution centers, and one of our data center facilities are located in Texas, a state that frequently experiences floods and storms. In addition, the facilities of our suppliers and where our manufacturers produce our products are located in parts of Asia that frequently experience typhoons and earthquakes. Acts of terrorism could also cause disruptions in our or our suppliers\u2019, manufacturers\u2019, and logistics providers\u2019 businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting Texas or other locations where we have operations or store significant inventory. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, criminal acts, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, or loss of critical data. As we rely heavily on our information technology and communications systems and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, these disruptions could harm our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt our suppliers\u2019 or manufacturers\u2019 businesses, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely significantly on information technology, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nOur business relies on information technology. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis, depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. We also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. Any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. The failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems, could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. If we experienced any significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. We also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. A service interruption or shutdown could have a materially adverse impact on our operating activities. Remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments.\nWe collect, store, process, and use personal and payment information and other customer data, which subjects us to regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection.\nWe collect, store, process, and use personal and payment information and other customer data, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to manage certain of these operations. Our customers\u2019 personal information may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment card data, and payment account information, as well as other information. Due to the volume and sensitivity of the personal information and data we manage, the security features of our information systems are critical.\nIf our security measures, some of which are managed by third parties, are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to access sensitive customer data, including payment card data. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Threats to information technology security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that may pose threats to our customers and our information technology systems. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our information technology systems or gain access to our systems, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information, or take other actions to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data, impersonating authorized users, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, we have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks and it is possible that in the future our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our security or systems, or reveal confidential information. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them.\nAny breach of our data security or that of our service providers could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. These events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer, employee, or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. We may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach, which could harm our results of operations. If we or our independent service providers or business partners experience a breach of systems compromising our customers' sensitive data, our brand could be harmed, sales of our products could decrease, and we could be exposed to losses, litigation, or regulatory proceedings. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify users, law enforcement, or payment companies about the incident and may need to provide some form of remedy, such as refunds, for the individuals affected by the incident.\nIn addition, privacy laws, rules, and regulations are constantly evolving in the United States and abroad and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, and will create new individual privacy rights for California consumers and place increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data. Further, as we expand internationally, we are subject to additional privacy rules, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, many of which are significantly more stringent than those in the United States. Complying with these evolving obligations is costly, and any failure to comply could give rise to unwanted media attention and other negative publicity, damage our customer and consumer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits, and may harm our business and results of operations.\nAny material disruption or breach of our information technology systems or those of third-party partners could materially damage our customer and business partner relationships and subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.\nWe depend on our information technology systems, as well as those of third parties, to design and develop new products, operate our website, host and manage our services, store data, process transactions, respond to user inquiries, and manage inventory and our supply chain as well as to conduct and manage other activities. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems or those of third parties that we depend upon, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our or their failure to successfully manage significant increases in user volume or successfully upgrade our or their systems, system failures, viruses, ransomware, security breaches, or other causes, could cause information, including data related to orders, to be lost or delayed, which could result in delays in the delivery of products to retailers and customers or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our products, harm our brand and reputation, and cause our sales to decline. If changes in technology cause our information systems, or those of third parties that we depend upon, to become obsolete, or if our or their information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, particularly as we increase sales through our DTC channel, we could damage our customer and business partner relationships and our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe interact with many of our consumers through our e-commerce platforms, and these systems face similar risks of interruption or attack. Consumers increasingly utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our brand. If we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our net revenues may be negatively impacted. If this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users, or loss of revenue.\nWe depend on cash generated from our operations to support our growth, and we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe primarily rely on cash flow generated from our sales to fund our current operations and our growth initiatives. As we expand our business, we will need significant cash from operations to purchase inventory, increase our product development, expand our manufacturer and supplier relationships, pay personnel, pay for the increased costs associated with operating as a public company, expand internationally, and further invest in our sales and marketing efforts. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund these activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available from our current or future credit facility, we may need additional equity or debt financing. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, our ability to operate and expand our business or to respond to competitive pressures could be harmed. Moreover, if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders may be diluted. The holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. In addition, any indebtedness we incur may subject us to covenants that restrict our operations and will require interest and principal payments that could create additional cash demands and financial risk for us.\nOur indebtedness may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and if we are unable to comply with the covenants in our current credit facility, our liquidity and results of operations could be harmed.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had $300.0 million principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Credit Facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned material subsidiaries, including YETI Coolers, LLC, which we refer to as YETI Coolers, and YETI Custom Drinkware LLC, which we refer to as YCD, and any of our future subsidiaries that become guarantors, together, which we refer to as the Guarantors, and is also secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of the Guarantors, in each case subject to certain customary exceptions. We may, from time to time, incur additional indebtedness under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility places certain conditions on us, including, subject to certain conditions, reductions and exceptions, requiring us to utilize a portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity, return capital to our stockholders, and other general corporate purposes. Our compliance with this condition may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business. For example, complying with this condition:\n\u2022increases our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or markets;\n\u2022makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates;\n\u2022limits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and\n\u2022potentially places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nThe Credit Facility places certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, subject to the qualifications and exceptions in the Credit Facility, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness under that facility. The Credit Facility also places certain limitations on our ability to enter into certain types of transactions, financing arrangements and investments, to make certain changes to our capital structure, and to guarantee certain indebtedness, among other things. The Credit Facility also places certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions and certain management fees. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, and in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions, our ability to: (a) pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our stock, or make other distributions; (b) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (c) sell stock in our subsidiaries; (d) create or incur liens; (e) make acquisitions or investments; (f) transfer or sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies; (g) make certain payments or prepayments of indebtedness subordinated to our obligations under the Credit Facility; and (h) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nThe Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants, including financial covenants regarding our total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. Fluctuations in these ratios may increase our interest expense. Failure to comply with these covenants and certain other provisions of the Credit Facility, or the occurrence of a change of control, could result in an event of default and an acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness that we may incur in the future.\nIf such an event of default and acceleration of our obligations occurs, the lenders under the Credit Facility would have the right to proceed against the collateral we granted to them to secure such indebtedness, which consists of substantially all of our assets. If the debt under the Credit Facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay this debt, which would immediately and materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The threat of our debt being accelerated in connection with a change of control could make it more difficult for us to attract potential buyers or to consummate a change of control transaction that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIn connection with our preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm us.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or personnel, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. The PCAOB defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. The PCAOB defines a significant deficiency as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of a registrant\u2019s financial reporting.\nDuring the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017, we identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses related to (i) ineffective information technology general controls (\u201cITGCs\u201d) in the areas of user access and program-change management over certain information technology systems that support our financial reporting process; and (ii) failure to properly detect and analyze issues in the accounting system related to inventory valuation. During the year ended December 29, 2018, we implemented controls related to inventory valuation and concluded that our remediation efforts were successful and that the previously-identified material weakness relating to inventory has been remediated. During 2019, we also implemented our remediation plan with respect to our ITGCs that included: (i) hiring a new Chief Information Officer and an IT Compliance Manager in July 2019 to continue to improve our information technology systems, including the enhancement of related policies and procedures and the development and documentation of our ongoing ITGC improvement initiatives; and (ii) implementing remediation activities that were completed during the fourth quarter of 2019 within our SAP environment and across our other information technology systems that support our financial reporting process. The material weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. Until the material weakness is fully remediated, business process automated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected ITGCs may be ineffective.\nAs a result of the material weakness related to ITGCs, we are unable to assert in this Report that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 28, 2019, and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of such date. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or that other material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future. Our failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our inability to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or the adverse internal control attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm could have an adverse effect on our business and could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements, which could cause a decline in the price of our common stock, and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the NYSE listing standards.\nOur results of operations are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe believe that our sales include a seasonal component. We expect our net sales to be highest in our second and fourth quarters, with the first quarter generating the lowest sales. To date, however, it has been difficult to accurately analyze this seasonality due to fluctuations in our sales. In addition, due to our more recent, and therefore more limited experience, with bags, storage, and outdoor lifestyle products and accessories, we are continuing to analyze the seasonality of these products. We expect that this seasonality will continue to be a factor in our results of operations and sales.\nOur annual and quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of the introduction of and advertising for our new products and those of our competitors and changes in our product mix. Variations in weather conditions may also harm our quarterly results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in our sales. As a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our results of operations between different quarters within a single fiscal year, or across different fiscal years, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. In the event that any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations result in our failure to meet our forecasts or the forecasts of the research analysts that may cover us in the future, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate or decline.\nIf our goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to our earnings.\nWe may be required to record future impairments of goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets to the extent the fair value of these assets falls below their book value. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions regarding future cash flows, gross margins, expenses, discount rates applied to these cash flows, and current market estimates of value. Estimates used for future sales growth rates, gross profit performance, and other assumptions used to estimate fair value could cause us to record material non-cash impairment charges, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or change significantly, our results of operations could be harmed.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity and the amount of sales and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be harmed if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and could result in a decline in our stock price.\nWe may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings and audits.\nOur business requires compliance with many laws and regulations, including labor and employment, sales and other taxes, customs, and consumer protection laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion, and sale of merchandise, and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and could also lead to damage awards, fines, and penalties. We may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, and other litigation. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions that could harm our operations or require us to pay substantial amounts of money, harming our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may be necessary, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, harming our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any pending or future legal or regulatory proceedings and audits could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the potential for product recalls, product liability, and other claims against us, which could affect our earnings and financial condition.\nAs a designer, marketer, retailer, and distributor of consumer products, we are subject to the United States Consumer Products Safety Act of 1972, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous, and similar laws under foreign jurisdictions. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety Commission or comparable foreign agency could require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products. Additionally, laws regulating consumer products exist in states and some cities, as well as other countries in which we sell our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. Any repurchase or recall of our products, monetary judgment, fine or other penalty could be costly and damaging to our reputation. If we were required to remove, or we voluntarily removed, our products from the market, our reputation could be tarnished and we may have large quantities of finished products that we could not sell.\nWe also face exposure to product liability claims and unusual or significant litigation in the event that one of our products is alleged to have resulted in bodily injury, property damage, or other adverse effects. In addition to the risk of monetary judgments or other penalties that may result from product liability claims, such claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace, adversely impact our brand, or result in an increase in the cost of producing our products. As a result, these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to liability if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThird parties may sue us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. The party claiming infringement might have greater resources than we do to pursue its claims, and we could be forced to incur substantial costs and devote significant management resources to defend against such litigation, even if the claims are meritless and even if we ultimately prevail. If the party claiming infringement were to prevail, we could be forced to modify or discontinue our products, pay significant damages, or enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party. In addition, any payments we are required to make, and any injunction we are required to comply with as a result of such infringement, could harm our reputation and financial results.\nWe may acquire or invest in other companies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our results of operations.\nIn the future, we may acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business, enhance our capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nIn any future acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired personnel, operations, and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from future acquisitions due to a number of factors, including: (a) an inability to integrate or benefit from acquisitions in a profitable manner; (b) unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition; (c) the incurrence of acquisition-related costs; (d) the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; (e) the loss of our or the acquired business\u2019 key employees; or (f) the issuance of dilutive equity securities, the incurrence of debt, or the use of cash to fund such acquisitions.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our results of operations based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe may be the target of strategic transactions.\nOther companies may seek to acquire us or enter into other strategic transactions. We will consider, discuss, and negotiate such transactions as we deem appropriate. The consideration of such transactions, even if not consummated, could divert management\u2019s attention from other business matters, result in adverse publicity or information leaks, and could increase our expenses.\nWe are subject to many hazards and operational risks that can disrupt our business, some of which may not be insured or fully covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards and operational risks inherent to our business, including: (a) general business risks; (b) product liability; (c) product recall; and (d) damage to third parties, our infrastructure, or properties caused by fires, floods and other natural disasters, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, human errors, and similar events.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover our liabilities related to such hazards or operational risks. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable, and insurance may not continue to be available on terms as favorable as our current arrangements. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim or a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws or unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations and application, and the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world.\nThe United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) on December 22, 2017, which had a significant impact to our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 and 2018.\nThe Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting governmental bodies could interpret the provisions of the Tax Act or issue related administrative guidance contrary to our interpretation.\nWe regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment.\nThe uncertainty regarding the potential phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact our operating results.\nLIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt, including our Credit Facility. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although the U.S. Federal Reserve, in connection with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is calculated based on short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR, including but not limited to the need to amend all debt instruments with LIBOR as the referenced rate and how this will impact our cost of variable rate debt. We will also need to consider any new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language, as published by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results.\nWe are subject to credit risk.\nWe are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. We provide credit to our retail partners in the ordinary course of our business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. While we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by our large retail partner base, and we make allowances for doubtful accounts, we nevertheless run the risk of our retail partners not being able to meet their payment obligations, particularly in a future economic downturn. If a material number of our retail partners were not able to meet their payment obligations, our results of operations could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline, including due to factors beyond our control, resulting in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of the Company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow the Company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022ratings changes by any securities analysts who follow the Company;\n\u2022sales or potential sales of shares by our stockholders, or the filing of a registration statement for these sales;\n\u2022announcement of new, or the implementation of previously announced, tariffs or changes in tariffs by the U.S. or foreign governments;\n\u2022adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or equity we may issue in the future;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022publication of adverse research reports about us, our industry, or individual companies within our industry;\n\u2022publicity related to problems in our manufacturing or the real or perceived quality of our products, as well as the failure to timely launch new products that gain market acceptance;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of our competitors;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the United States or global economy;\n\u2022any major change in our Board of Directors or management;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us or negative results of any lawsuits;\n\u2022security breaches or cyberattacks;\n\u2022legislation or regulation of our business;\n\u2022loss of key personnel;\n\u2022new products introduced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022the perceived or real impact of events that harm our direct competitors;\n\u2022developments with respect to our trademarks, patents, or proprietary rights;\n\u2022general market conditions; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events, which could be unrelated to us or outside of our control.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies in our industry, as well as those of newly public companies. In the past, stockholders of other public companies have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation, and cash flows.\nOur directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders continue to have substantial control over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control\nThe group consisting of Cortec Group Fund V, L.P. and its affiliates (collectively, \u201cCortec\u201d) is our largest stockholder, owning 34.2% of the total voting power of our common stock as of the date of this Report. Furthermore, our directors, executive officers, and other holders of more than 5% of our common stock, together with their affiliates, own, in the aggregate, 74.8% of our outstanding common stock as of the date of this Report. As a result, these stockholders have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might decrease the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of the Company;\n\u2022impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nAlthough we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards, during the applicable phase-in periods, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies.\nUpon the completion of a secondary offering on November 12, 2019, YETI ceased to be a controlled company under the NYSE listing standards. Under the NYSE listing standards, a company that ceases to be a controlled company must comply with the independent board committee requirements as they relate to the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees on the following phase-in schedule: (1) one independent committee member at the time it ceases to be a controlled company; (2) a majority of independent committee members within 90 days of the date it ceases to be a controlled company; and (3) all independent committee members within one year of the date it ceases to be a controlled company. Additionally, the NYSE listing standards provide a 12-month phase-in period from the date a company ceases to be a controlled company to comply with the majority independent board requirement.\nSince ceasing to be a controlled company, we have appointed a new independent director to our Board of Directors, and we intend to appoint additional directors to our Board of Directors and committees and/or appoint current directors who are then deemed independent to additional committees within the time periods required by the NYSE listing standards. During these phase-in periods, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies of which the majority of directors are independent and, if, within the phase-in periods, we are not able to comply with the NYSE listing requirements, we may be subject to delisting actions by the NYSE. In addition, a change in our Board of Directors and committee membership may result in a change in corporate strategy and operating philosophies, and may result in deviations from our current growth strategy.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors currently consists of nine directors, comprised of our CEO, one of our Founders, four outside directors, and three directors selected by Cortec, our principal stockholder. Pursuant to the terms of a stockholders agreement, dated October 24, 2018, by and among YETI, Cortec and certain other stockholders (the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d), Cortec has the right, for so long as it beneficially owns 20% or more of our then outstanding common stock, to have one of its representatives serve as Chair of our Board of Directors and Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors, as well as the right, for so long as it beneficially owns at least 10% of our then outstanding common stock, to select nominees for our Board of Directors, subject to a phase-out period based on Cortec\u2019s share ownership. Accordingly, even if we are no longer a controlled company, holders of our common stock may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that do not have a stockholders agreement similar to ours.\nSubstantial future sales, or the perception or anticipation of future sales, of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur stock price could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock or the perception or anticipation that such sales could occur, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. As of December 28, 2019, we had 86,773,863 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nUnder the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of October 24, 2018, by and among the Company, Cortec, our Founders, certain of their respective affiliates, and certain other stockholders (as amended, the \"Registration Rights Agreement\"), certain of the parties thereto have demand registration rights in respect of the shares of common stock they hold, subject to certain conditions. In addition, in the event that we register additional shares of common stock for sale to the public, we are required to give notice of the registration to the parties to the Registration Rights Agreement and, subject to certain limitations, include shares of common stock held by them in the registration. In addition, certain of our stockholders have adopted trading plans established under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, pursuant to which they each sell, subject to the terms of such trading plans, a significant portion of their remaining shares of common stock. If our existing stockholders register or sell substantial amounts of our common stock, this could harm the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between the registration or sales and the performance of our business. In addition, as restrictions on resale end, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the markets as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities.\nWe have also registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans, which are able to be sold freely in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in our management. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws:\n\u2022provide that our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors;\n\u2022prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent from and after the date that Cortec beneficially owns less than 35% of our outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022provide that stockholders may remove directors only for cause, and only with the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of our then outstanding common stock;\n\u2022provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law or as set forth in the Stockholders Agreement be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u2022restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n\u2022do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election);\n\u2022provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, our CEO, or the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors;\n\u2022provide that stockholders will be permitted to amend our Amended and Restated Bylaws only upon receiving at least 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class; and\n\u2022provide that certain provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may only be amended upon receiving at least 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares then entitled to vote, voting together as a single class.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we have opted out of the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which generally prohibit a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. However, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides substantially the same limitations as are set forth in Section 203 but also provides that Cortec and its affiliates and any of their direct or indirect transferees and any group as to which such persons are a party do not constitute \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for purposes of this provision.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our stockholders, directors, officers, or other employees to us or to our stockholders; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the DGCL; or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision does not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), or the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and stockholders of YETI will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nYETI Holdings, Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own and, as such, it depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund its operations and expenses, including future dividend payments, if any.\nAs a holding company, our principal source of cash flow is distributions from our subsidiaries. Therefore, our ability to fund and conduct our business, service our debt, and pay dividends, if any, depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make upstream cash distributions to us. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities, and although they are wholly owned and controlled by us, they have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends, or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us is also be subject to, among other things, restrictions that may be contained in our subsidiary agreements (as entered into from time to time), availability of sufficient funds in such subsidiaries and applicable laws and regulatory restrictions. Claims of any creditors of our subsidiaries generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and claims of our creditors and stockholders. To the extent the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to us is limited in any way, our ability to fund and conduct our business, service our debt, and pay dividends, if any, could be harmed.", "PERMNO": 18145, "SIC": 3949, "TIC": "YETI"}
