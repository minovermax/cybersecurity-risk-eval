{"cik": "1228627", "company": "REXAHN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information included in this Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of these risks. If any of these risks occur, the value of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe currently have no product revenues, have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception and will need to raise additional capital to operate our business.\nTo date, we have generated no product revenues and have incurred negative cash flow from operations. Until we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our drug candidates, we cannot sell our drugs and will not have product revenues. We expect to continue to incur significant development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from the net proceeds of equity or debt offerings, cash on hand, licensing fees and grants, if any. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we will have to reduce our research and development activities. We will first reduce research and development activities associated with our pre-clinical compounds. To the extent necessary, we will then reduce our research and development activities related to some or all of our clinical stage product candidates.\nUnforeseen events, difficulties, complications and delays may occur that could cause us to utilize our existing capital at a faster rate than projected, including the progress of our research and development efforts, the cost and timing of regulatory approvals and the costs of protecting our intellectual property rights. We may seek additional financing to implement and fund other drug candidate development, clinical trial and research and development efforts, including clinical trials for other new drug candidates, as well as other research and development projects.\nWe will need additional financing to continue to develop our drug candidates, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to secure additional financing in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to complete our planned pre-clinical and clinical trials or obtain approval of our drug candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, we may be forced to reduce or discontinue product development or product licensing, reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities in order to improve our liquidity to enable us to continue operations. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the sale of our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, which may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nWe are not currently profitable and may never become profitable.\nTo date, we have generated no product revenues and have incurred negative cash flow from operations. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $91,332,308 and $72,810,707, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, we had net losses of $18,521,601 and $9,499,424, respectively. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our drug candidates, we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future, based on the following considerations:\n\u00b7 continued pre-clinical development and clinical trials for our current and new drug candidates;\n\u00b7 finding suitable partners to help us research, develop and commercialize new drug candidates;\n\u00b7 efforts to seek regulatory approvals for our drug candidates;\n\u00b7 implementing additional internal systems and infrastructure;\n\u00b7 in-licensing additional technologies to develop; and\n\u00b7 hiring additional personnel or entering into relationships with third parties to perform functions that we are unable to perform on our own.\nWe also expect to continue to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and capital expenditures. Until we have the capacity to generate revenues, we are relying upon outside funding resources to fund our cash flow requirements. If these resources are depleted or unavailable, we may be unable to continue to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe have a limited operating history, and we have not demonstrated an ability to commercialize drug candidates.\nWe are a clinical-stage company with a limited number of drug candidates. We currently do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval, and we have not demonstrated an ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates. The successful commercialization of our drug candidates will require us to first perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u00b7 conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 participating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u00b7 formulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u00b7 conducting sales and marketing activities.\nTo date, our operations have been limited to organizing and staffing the Company, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology, and undertaking drug candidate research and development, including pre-clinical trials and clinical trials of our principal drug candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for assessing our ability to commercialize drug candidates.\nSeveral of our drug candidates are in clinical trials, which are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nOur drug candidates are in various stages of development and require extensive clinical testing. Such testing is expensive and time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge and expertise. Archexin entered a Phase IIa clinical trial in January 2014, RX-3117 entered a Phase Ib clinical trial in January 2014, and Supinoxin entered a Phase I clinical trial in August 2013.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming, and the outcome is not certain; the results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. We estimate that clinical trials of our current drug candidates will take multiple years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of a clinical trial, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed or precluded by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority on the design of a given trial, or in obtaining authorization to commence a trial;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in obtaining approval of an IRB to conduct a clinical trial at a given site;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care of the ineligibility of a site to participate;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in recruiting and enrolling study subjects;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in having subjects complete a clinical trial or return for post-treatment follow up;\n\u00b7 clinical sites or investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7 inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites;\n\u00b7 failure of third-party clinical trial managers to meet their contractual obligations or deadlines;\n\u00b7 the need to modify a study protocol;\n\u00b7 unforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7 emergence of dosing issues;\n\u00b7 lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u00b7 change in the standard of care of the indication being studied;\n\u00b7 reliance on third-party suppliers for the clinical trial supply of drug candidates;\n\u00b7 inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u00b7 lack of sufficient funding to finance the clinical trials; and\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or administrative action.\nWe, the FDA or an IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our IND applications or the conduct of these trials. Additionally, we may have difficulty enrolling patients in our clinical trials. If we experience such difficulties, we may not be able to complete a clinical trial or we may experience significant delays in completing a clinical trial.\nIf the results of our clinical trials fail to support the claims of any of our drug candidates, the completion of development of that candidate may be significantly delayed, or we may be forced to abandon development altogether, which will significantly impair our ability to generate product revenues.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that clinical results will support our drug candidate claims. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that one or more of our drug candidates is safe and effective for indicated uses. As a result, we may have to conduct additional clinical trials or may decide to abandon a drug candidate, in which case we may never recognize any revenue related to such candidate. Standard of care treatments may change, which may require additional clinical trials. Repeating clinical trials or conducting additional clinical trials will delay the filing of an NDA and, ultimately, delay our ability to commercialize our drug candidates and generate product revenues.\nWe may not obtain the necessary U.S. or worldwide regulatory approvals to commercialize our drug candidates, and we cannot guarantee how long it will take the FDA or other comparable regulatory agencies to review applications for our drug candidates.\nWe will need FDA approval to commercialize our drug candidates in the United States and approvals from the comparable regulatory authorities to commercialize our drug candidates in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe time it takes to obtain approval, either in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, is unpredictable, but typically takes many years, depending upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate. Obtaining approval requires substantial resources and is subject to regulatory authorities\u2019 substantial discretion. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s development and may vary among jurisdictions. We cannot guarantee that any of our drug candidates will ultimately be approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority, or the length of time obtaining approval will take. One of our drug candidates, Archexin is an ASO compound. To date, the FDA has approved very few ASO compounds. In addition, Archexin, and Archexin-Nano are in the drug class known as Akt-1 inhibitors that to date have not been approved by the FDA, nor have we submitted an NDA. After clinical trials are completed, the FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign authority for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u00b7 disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 failure to demonstrate to the authority\u2019s satisfaction that the product candidate is safe and effective for the proposed indication;\n\u00b7 failure of clinical trials to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u00b7 failure to demonstrate that the product\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks;\n\u00b7 disagreement with our interpretation of pre-clinical or clinical data; and\n\u00b7 inadequacies in the manufacturing facilities or processes of third-party manufacturers.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign authority may require us to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical testing, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans or cause us to abandon the development program. Further, any approval we receive may be for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not include labeling claims necessary for successful commercialization of the product candidate or may be contingent upon our conducting costly post-marketing clinical trials, Any of these scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects of a product candidate.\nEven if our product candidates obtain approval, they may face future development and regulatory difficulties that can negatively affect commercial prospects.\nEven if we obtain approval for a product candidate, it would be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements and restrictions of the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities regarding manufacturing, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting. Failure by us or any of the third parties on which we rely to meet those requirements can lead to enforcement action that could significantly impair our ability to successfully commercialize a given product. If the FDA or a comparable regulatory authority becomes aware of new safety information, it can impose additional restrictions on how the product is marketed, if at all.\nThere is no assurance that any of our products that has received or will receive orphan drug designation will subsequently obtain orphan drug exclusivity, or that any such exclusivity will provide the desired benefit.\nAlthough we have obtained orphan drug designation for several uses of Archexin and one use of RX-3117 and may obtain additional orphan drug designation for these or other product candidates, we are not assured of being awarded orphan drug exclusivity or the enjoying the benefits of such exclusivity, even if any of these products is approved for its orphan-designated use. If another company also holding orphan drug designation for a product containing the same active moiety intended for the same rare disease or condition receives approval before our orphan-designated product, approval of our product could be precluded for seven years, because of that product\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity, unless we could demonstrate our product to be clinically superior to the earlier-approved product. Similarly, even if our orphan designated drug were approved first and awarded seven-year orphan drug exclusivity, it would not block approval of the other product, if that product were shown to be clinically superior, or if we fail to assure a sufficient quantity of our orphan drug. Additionally, because orphan drug exclusivity is product- and indication-specific, it does not prevent approval of another drug for the same orphan indication or the same drug for a different use.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept and use our drugs, our ability to generate revenue from sales of our products will be materially impaired.\nEven if the FDA approves our drug candidates, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Future acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u00b7 awareness of a drug\u2019s availability and benefits;\n\u00b7 perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs;\n\u00b7 pharmacological benefit and cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products;\n\u00b7 availability of reimbursement for our products from government or other third-party payors;\n\u00b7 effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any; and\n\u00b7 the price at which we sell our products.\nBecause we expect sales of our current drug candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of any of these drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any of our product candidates, these products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available in a timely manner from government third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved products for a particular indication. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved.\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government healthcare programs and other third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available promptly or at all for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases. Limited coverage may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nPayors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price (\u201cASP\u201d), average manufacturer price, and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, has made draft National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (\u201cNADAC\u201d), and draft National Average Retail Price (\u201cNARP\u201d), data publicly available on at least a monthly basis. In July 2013, CMS suspended the publication of draft NARP data, pending funding decisions. In November 2013, CMS moved to publishing final rather than draft NADAC data and has since made updated NADAC data publicly available on a weekly basis. Therefore, it may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover any products that we are able to successfully commercialize.\nIf we successfully commercialize any of our products, we may participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Participation is required for federal funds to be available for our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Part B of the Medicare program.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.\nIn addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (\u201cFSS\u201d), pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (\u201cVHCA\u201d). Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its innovator and single source products available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d), Public Health Service, and Coast Guard, that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price. Moreover, pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD TRICARE Management Activity (\u201cTMA\u201d), now the Defense Health Agency (\u201cDHA\u201d), to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, manufacturers are required to provide rebates on utilization of their innovator and single source products that are dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies. The formula for determining the rebate is established in the regulations and is based on the difference between the annual non-federal average manufacturer price and the Federal Ceiling Price (these price points are required to be calculated by us under the VHCA). The requirements under the 340B, FSS, and TRICARE programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Limited coverage may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Third-party payors also may seek additional clinical evidence, including expensive pharmacoeconomic studies beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations, before covering our products for those patients. If reimbursement is available only for limited indications, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including those based on recently enacted and future legislation, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.\nIn recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price we can receive for those products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). This law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of average manufacturer price (\u201cAMP\u201d), which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. In 2012, CMS issued proposed regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, but CMS has not yet issued final regulations. CMS is currently expected to release the final regulations in 2015. Although it is too early to determine the full effect of the Affordable Care Act, this law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nThe Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $3.0 billion in 2015, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the new law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d\nThe Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing discount program. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201corphan drugs\u201d-those designated under section 526 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act-from the ceiling price requirements for these newly-eligible entities. The Health Resources and Services Administration (\u201cHRSA\u201d), which administers the 340B program, issued an interpretive rule to implement the orphan drug exception which interprets the orphan drug exception narrowly. It exempts orphan drugs from the ceiling price requirements for the newly eligible entities only when the orphan drug is used for its orphan indication. The newly eligible entities are entitled to purchase orphan drugs at the ceiling price when the orphan drug is not used for its orphan indication. A manufacturer trade group has filed a lawsuit challenging the interpretive rule as inconsistent with the statutory language. That challenge remains ongoing. The uncertainty regarding how the statutory orphan drug exception will be applied will increase the complexity of compliance, will make compliance more time-consuming, and could negatively impact our results of operations if we are able to commercialize our products. If HRSA's narrow interpretation of the scope of the orphan drug exception prevails, it could potentially negatively impact the price we are paid by certain entities for orphan drugs that we successfully commercialize and increase the complexity of compliance with the 340B program. In addition, because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discounts to increase.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, recent legislative enactments have resulted in Medicare payments being subject to a two percent reduction, referred to as sequestration, until 2024. Continuation of sequestration or enactment of other reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs could affect our ability to achieve a profit on any candidate products that are approved for marketing.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nIf we are able to successfully commercialize any of our products and if we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, failure to comply with reporting and payment obligations under these programs could result in additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental pricing programs require manufacturers to report pricing data to the government. Pricing calculations vary among products and programs and include average manufacturer price and best price for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, average sales price for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program, and non-federal average manufacturer price for the FSS pricing program. If we successfully commercialize any of our products and participate in such governmental pricing programs, we will be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. That liability could be significant. For example, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price, average sales price, best price, or non-federal average manufacturer price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of average sales price, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price, average sales price, and best price, and quarterly/annual non-federal average manufacturer price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for other sanctions, such as termination from the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\u00b7 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing, or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchase, lease or order, any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7 the federal civil False Claims Act imposes penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7 the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the CMS information related to \u201cpayments or other transfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members; and\n\u00b7 analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to certain healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. For a fuller discussion of the applicable anti-kickback fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations applicable to our business, see Item 1, \u2018Description of Business - Government Regulation\u201d\nDevelopments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nWe compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies as well as academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as more experience in:\n\u00b7 developing drugs;\n\u00b7 undertaking pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u00b7 obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs;\n\u00b7 formulating and manufacturing drugs; and\n\u00b7 launching, marketing and selling drugs.\nLarge pharmaceutical companies currently sell both generic and proprietary compounds for the treatment of cancer. In addition, companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition. Many of these organizations have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel, parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations. Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or safe than ours, which could render our product candidates less competitive prior to recovery by us of expenses incurred with respect to their development.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage our growth, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition to our own internally developed drug candidates, we are actively seeking opportunities to in-license compounds in oncology and other therapeutic areas that are strategic additions to our product pipeline. Such additional drug candidates could significantly increase our capital requirements and place further strain on our resources, including on the time of our existing personnel, which may delay or otherwise adversely affect the development of our existing drug candidates. As of December 31, 2014, we had 20 full-time employees. We may need to hire more employees as our product pipeline and operations expand, further increasing the size of our organization and related expenses. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not efficiently use our resources, which may delay the development of our drug candidates and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. Our success may be negatively impacted if key personnel leave.\nAttracting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to our future success. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in engaging personnel with the skills and experience to support our business and research and development activities.\nOur key personnel, especially Dr. Chang H. Ahn, our Chairman and Chief Scientist, Dr. Peter Suzdak, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. Tae Heum Jeong, our Chief Financial Officer, provide critical technical knowledge and expertise. The loss of Dr. Ahn, Dr. Suzdak, Dr. Jeong, or any of the other members of our management team, could result in delays in product development and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies for any of our executive officers.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\nMuch of our drug development program depends upon third-party researchers, and the results of our clinical trials and such research activities are, to a limited extent, beyond our control.\nWe have engaged third-party contract research organizations and other investigators and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our pre-clinical studies, toxicology studies and clinical trials. Engaging third-party contract research organizations is typical practice in our industry. However, relying on such organizations means that the clinical trials and other studies described above are being conducted at external locations and that the completion of these trials and studies is not within our direct control. Trials and studies may be delayed due to circumstances outside our control, and such delays may result in additional expenses for us.\nWhile we make every effort internally to oversee the work of third-party contractors, these collaborators are not our employees, and we cannot control the effort, time or other resources that they devote to our programs. Third parties may not assign priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking them ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our FDA applications and introduction of new drugs to the market may be delayed. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If our collaborators assist our competitors at our expense, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture our drug candidates, which exposes us to a number of risks that may delay development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products or result in higher product costs.\nWe have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and we lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own drug candidates internally. Therefore, we rely on third-party expertise to support us in this area. We have entered into contracts with third-party manufacturers to manufacture, supply, store and distribute supplies of our drug candidates for our clinical trials. If any of our drug candidates receives FDA approval, we expect to rely on third-party contractors to manufacture our drugs. We have no current plans to build internal manufacturing capacity for any product, and we have no long-term supply arrangements.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following potential risks:\n\u00b7 We may be unable to contract with third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and is subject to FDA approval. FDA approval requires testing and compliance inspections. In addition, any new manufacturer would have to be qualified and approved to produce our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any;\n\u00b7 Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our drugs in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any;\n\u00b7 Our third-party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials through completion or to successfully produce, store and distribute our commercial products, if approved;\n\u00b7 Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, and other government agencies to ensure compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards, but we may ultimately be responsible for any of their failures;\n\u00b7 If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to such improvements; and\n\u00b7 A third-party manufacturer may gain knowledge from working with us that could be used to supply one of our competitors with a product that competes with ours.\nEach of these risks could delay or have other adverse impacts on our clinical trials and the approval and commercialization of our drug candidates, potentially resulting in higher costs, reduced revenues or both.\nWe have no experience selling, marketing or distributing products and currently no internal capability to do so.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. While we intend to have a role in the commercialization of our products, we do not anticipate having the resources in the foreseeable future to develop global sales and marketing capabilities for all of our proposed products. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies that have sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, a strategic interest in the products under development and the ability to successfully market and sell our products. To the extent that we decide not to, or are unable to, enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, significant capital expenditures, management resources and time will be required to establish and develop an in-house marketing and sales force with the necessary expertise. We cannot assure you that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, as well as the terms of our agreements with such third parties, which cannot be predicted at this early stage of our development. We cannot assure you that such efforts will be successful. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to market and sell our products in the United States or overseas.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators. Although we currently carry clinical trial insurance and product liability insurance we, or any collaborators, may not be able to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost. Even if our agreements with any future collaborators entitle us to indemnification against losses, such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claims arise.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we breach the license agreements for our product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe do not own the rights to the intellectual property underlying Serdaxin and Zoraxel. Our rights to these product candidates have been granted by third parties pursuant to license agreements. If we fail to meet our obligations under these license agreements or otherwise breach the agreements, we may lose our exclusive rights, which may result in a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for the applicable product candidate.\nIf we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish, and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and licensees to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We have an active patent protection program that includes filing patent applications on new compounds, formulations, delivery systems and methods of making and using products and prosecuting these patent applications in the United States and abroad. As patents issue, we also file continuation applications as appropriate. Although we have taken steps to build a strong patent portfolio, we cannot predict:\n\u00b7 the degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our licensed patents;\n\u00b7 if and when patents will issue in the United States or any other country;\n\u00b7 whether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our licensed patents and patent applications;\n\u00b7 whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights, which may be costly whether we win or lose;\n\u00b7 whether any of our patents will be challenged by our competitors alleging invalidity or unenforceability and, if opposed or litigated, the outcome of any administrative or court action as to patent validity, enforceability or scope;\n\u00b7 whether a competitor will develop a similar compound that is outside the scope of protection afforded by a patent or whether the patent scope is inherent in the claims modified due to interpretation of claim scope by a court;\n\u00b7 whether there were activities previously undertaken by a licensor that could limit the scope, validity or enforceability of licensed patents and intellectual property; or\n\u00b7 whether a competitor will assert infringement of its patents or intellectual property, whether or not meritorious, and what the outcome of any related litigation or challenge may be.\nOur success also depends upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants and advisors as well as our licensors, sublicensees and contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, we require all employees to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired, and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nDue to legal and factual uncertainties regarding the scope and protection afforded by patents and other proprietary rights, we may not have meaningful protection from competition.\nOur long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our patent rights, and the patent rights of biopharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. These uncertainties also mean that any patents that we own or may obtain in the future could be subject to challenge, and even if not challenged, may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition. Patents already issued to us or our pending applications may become subject to dispute, and any dispute could be resolved against us.\nIn connection with the process of seeking patent protection for Supinoxin in Japan, we filed a patent application including claims covering Supinoxin with the Japanese Patent Office (\u201cJPO\u201d) for examination. The JPO initially agreed that the claims covering the compound for Supinoxin were allowable, but as a result of a mistake in the patent application filing as prepared and submitted by our Japanese patent attorneys and incomplete review by the JPO\u2019s patent examiner, the JPO issued a decision to grant a patent with claims that did not include Supinoxin. We appealed this decision with the JPO to request withdrawal of the decision to grant so that the correct claims would be allowed, but the JPO refused to withdraw its decision. As a result, and in accordance with Japanese law and procedure for appealing patent application decisions, we have filed a lawsuit against the JPO in Tokyo District Court to cause the JPO to reverse its decision to grant the errant patent and to allow a patent that includes claims covering Supinoxin. The patent application at issue remains pending subject to the outcome of this action. There can be no guarantee that we will be successful in winning the appeal to correct the error in the patent registration that would exclude the compound for Supinoxin.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and be forced to defend against litigation and pay damages.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and may have to:\n\u00b7 obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7 redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u00b7 stop using the subject matter claimed in patents held by others, which could cause us to lose the use of one or more of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7 pay damages; or\n\u00b7 defend litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose and that could result in a substantial diversion of our management resources.\nAlthough we have not received any claims of infringement by any third parties to date, we expect that as our drug candidates move further into clinical trials and commercialization and our public profile is raised, we may be subject to such claims.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn investment in shares of our common stock is very speculative and involves a very high degree of risk.\nTo date, we have generated no revenues from product sales and only minimal revenues from a research agreement with a minority shareholder and interest on bank account balances and short-term investments. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $91,332,308 and $72,810,707, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, we had net losses of $18,521,601 and $9,499,424, respectively, partially as a result of expenses incurred through a combination of research and development activities related to the various technologies under our control and expenses supporting those activities. Until we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our drug candidates, we cannot sell our drugs and will not have product revenues.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7 the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in our relationships with our licensors or other strategic partners;\n\u00b7 developments concerning intellectual property rights and regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 variations in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u00b7 changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; and\n\u00b7 developments and market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\nFurther, the stock market, in general, and the market for biotechnology companies, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance and which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. You should also be aware that price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.\nWe will require additional capital funding the receipt of which may impair the value of our common stock.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our research, development, sales and marketing activities. We will need to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt offerings or through arrangements with strategic partners or other sources in order to continue to develop our drug candidates. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available when needed or on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the new equity securities may have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing common stock.\nWe have not paid dividends to our stockholders in the past, and we do not anticipate paying dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, to fund the continuing operation of our business, and therefore we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, you will not realize any income from an investment in our common stock until and unless you sell your shares at a profit.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and direct our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.", "PERMNO": 92665, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "REXN"}
