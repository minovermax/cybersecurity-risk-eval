If any of the events described below actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Our business could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not material. The reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe may not successfully implement our business strategies.\nWe are pursuing, and will continue to pursue, strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our long-term success, including: leveraging the scale, reach and infrastructure of our supply chain network to accelerate the adoption of our Prescription Management platform; increasing sales to our Customers; driving category growth; developing advanced insight and analytics and software; and enhancing Customer and Animal Owners relationships. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives, including significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives. It could take several years to realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all. Additionally, our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business.\nSince Customers may be hesitant to migrate or integrate their critical business systems and procedures to those provided by us, the market and the sales cycle for our technology and services may develop more slowly than we expect.\nOur success depends, in part, on the willingness of Customers to adopt new technology and services. Many veterinary practices have invested substantial effort and financial resources into the information systems and procedures that support their businesses and may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate or integrate these systems with online or cloud-based, on-demand services. Other factors that may affect market acceptance of our services include:\n\u2022\nthe security capabilities, reliability, and availability of on-demand services,\n\u2022\nconcerns with entrusting a third party to maintain and manage data, especially confidential or sensitive data,\n\u2022\nour ability to minimize the time and resources required to implement our services,\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain high levels of Customer satisfaction,\n\u2022\nour ability to implement upgrades and other changes to our software without disrupting services we provide,\n\u2022\nthe level of customization or configuration we offer,\n\u2022\nthe ability to provide rapid response time during periods of intense activity on Customer websites, and\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and availability of competing products and services.\nThe market for these services may develop more slowly than we expect, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe animal-health market is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe animal-health market is highly competitive and rapidly changing, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Our competitors include the animal-health businesses of large pharmaceutical or distribution companies, specialty animal-health businesses, animal-health focused businesses, practice management service providers, and Internet-based businesses, such as Chewy, Inc. and PetMed Express, Inc., also known as 1-800-PetMeds, and may, in the future, include new market entrants. Some of our competitors have access to greater financial, marketing, technical, and other resources than us that could allow them to compete more effectively.\nIf any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor such as technological advances or newer low-cost business models with the ability to operate at higher gross margins, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Additional competitive pressure could arise from, among other things, limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products or services being introduced into a particular market, price reductions by competitors, or the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale.\nChanges in manufacturer sales channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share, margins, and distribution of our products.\nIn most markets, companion animal owners typically purchase their animal-health products directly from veterinarians. Companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal-health products from sources other than veterinarians, such as online retailers, \u201cbig-box\u201d retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. This trend has been demonstrated, for example, by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years. Companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on, and visits to, veterinarians as they rely more on online animal-health information and retailers that now offer basic veterinary services. Because we market our companion animal prescription products through the veterinarian channel, both in-office and through our online platform, any decrease in reliance on and visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal-health products if human health products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.\nBecause substantially all the products that we distribute and sell are not manufactured by us, we are dependent on third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all our products.\nWe obtain substantially all our products from third parties. Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us. Therefore, suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request or at all. Additionally, certain key suppliers, in the aggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell. In addition, we currently purchase many products and materials from single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include branded and patented products from major pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Elanco Animal Health Incorporated, Merck & Co., Inc., Vedco, Inc., and Zoetis, Inc., among others. These five suppliers accounted for approximately 50% of our purchases for the year ended December 31, 2019. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from single-source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including interruption due to physical loss of the manufacturers' or their suppliers facilities and the manufacturers\u2019 failure to comply with applicable government requirements. The failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA, the DEA, or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall, cessation of sales or other market disruptions. If any of our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in our required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis. There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all. An extended interruption in the supply of our products, especially any high-sales volume product, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition.\nOn February 7, 2019, we entered into a $1.5 billion syndicated credit agreement with a group of lenders for a five-year term (the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). The Credit Facilities include a $1.2 billion term loan facility, (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d), which was fully funded and primarily used to pay a dividend to Henry Schein, and a $300 million revolving line of credit for working capital and general corporate purposes (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, there was $1.2 billion outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and there were no borrowings from the Revolving Credit Facility, although we do utilize the Revolving Credit Facility from time to time.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness. Although the agreements governing our Credit Facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nOur current level of indebtedness, and any additional indebtedness, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including the following:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes,\n\u2022\nrequiring that a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to payments on our indebtedness instead of other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and future business opportunities,\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness or satisfy other obligations,\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make the expenditures necessary to transform our business,\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt, and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and making us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.\nThe agreements governing our Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants, which restrict our operational flexibility.\nThe agreements governing our Credit Facilities contain restrictions and limitations on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests, including financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness,\n\u2022\nmake dividends and other restricted payments,\n\u2022\nincur additional liens,\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets,\n\u2022\nmake investments,\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets,\n\u2022\nenter into restrictive agreements,\n\u2022\nchange the nature of the business, and\n\u2022\nenter certain transactions with affiliates.\nThe agreements governing our Credit Facilities also contain other restrictions customary for facilities of this nature.\nOur ability to borrow additional amounts under these agreements will depend on satisfaction of these covenants, as well as financial covenants (i) consolidated net total leverage ratio and (ii) consolidated net interest coverage ratio. Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these covenants. Our failure to comply with obligations under these agreements may result in an event of default under those agreements. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, some beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund capital expenditures, will depend on our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We have substantial indebtedness, and may incur additional indebtedness, which could lead to increased interest expense and could increase the amount of cash flows required to fund interest expense associated with our indebtedness. In addition, certain obligations under the Credit Facilities bear interest at variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we maintained interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $500 million, which are intended to fix the future interest payments associated with our $1.2 billion variable-rate Term Loan Facility. These swap agreements expire July 31, 2021. Despite these derivative contracts, interest rate increases still could result in larger debt service requirements. Such an increase in our debt service obligations would adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, we may not be able to take advantage of interest rate decreases where we have fixed rates utilizing swap agreements. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Credit Facilities or any subsequent credit agreement, or that we can obtain alternative financing proceeds in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe debt service obligations under our Credit Facilities could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nWe may require financing to fund our ongoing operations and capital expenditures, the availability of which is highly uncertain.\nThe capital and credit markets can experience volatility and disruption. Such markets can exert extreme downward pressure on stock prices and upward pressure on the cost of new debt capital and can severely restrict credit availability for most issuers. Our business will require expenditures to develop enhancements to our platforms, expand capacity, and add new businesses complementary to our product lines. In the future we may engage in transactions that depend on our ability to obtain financing. We may also seek financing to fund our ongoing operations.\nDepending on conditions in the financial markets and/or our financial performance, we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to pursue our current and future spending programs, we may be forced to cancel or scale back those programs. Failure to successfully pursue our capital expenditure and other spending plans could negatively affect our ability to compete effectively and have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nMany of our Customers and Animal Owners are price sensitive, and if the prices for our products and services are unacceptable to them, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our Customers and Animal Owners are price sensitive. As the market for our services matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with us, we may be unable to retain our existing Customers or attract new customers based on the same price pricing model as previously used. As a result, it is possible that competitive dynamics in our market may require us to change our pricing model or reduce our prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may lose Customers and have difficulty attracting new customers if we have defects, disruptions, or poor service in our technology product offerings.\nBecause we deliver online and cloud-based applications as a service, errors or defects in the software applications underlying the service, or a failure of our hosting infrastructure, may render the service unavailable to Customers. Since our Customers will use our platform to manage critical aspects of their businesses, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with the platform, whether in connection with the day-to-day operation of the platform, upgrades or otherwise, could damage the Customers\u2019 businesses. If we experience any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our online and cloud-based services, Customers could delay or withhold payment or stop doing business with us, and our business, results of operations and reputation could be harmed.\nConsolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products.\nVeterinarians are our primary customers. In recent years, there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals. In addition, our distributors have seen consolidation in their industries. Furthermore, we have seen the expansion of corporate customers, including larger cross-border ones, and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups (cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers). The pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies. If these trends towards consolidation continue, these customers and distributors could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing. The resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our information systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time or unauthorized access is obtained to a Customer\u2019s or their Client\u2019s data, we may incur significant liabilities, our service may be perceived as not being secure, Customers may curtail or stop using our products or services and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe services we offer involve the maintenance of our Customers\u2019 and Animal Owners sensitive information. In addition, we rely on information systems (\u201cIS\u201d) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage, and store data to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaintain and manage systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers,\n\u2022\nreceive, process and ship orders on a timely basis,\n\u2022\nmanage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of Customers, and\n\u2022\nprocess payments to suppliers.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or other event that bypasses our IS security systems causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems and/or the loss of business, customer or client information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, IS security systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.\nIn addition, we develop products and provide services to our Customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our Customers, their clients and/or governmental agencies. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our Customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our Customers, their clients and/or governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses.\nAdditionally, changes in the legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology-based products and services. In addition, changes in the regulatory environment could increase our compliance related costs.\nRisks associated with these and other actual or perceived IS security breaches may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property,\n\u2022\noperational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities,\n\u2022\nthe need to continually evolve procedures and safeguards to meet new IS challenges, and enhancing protections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional costs on us,\n\u2022\nclaims, fines and penalties, and costs for remediation, or substantial defense and settlement expenses, and\n\u2022\nnegative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our Customers or Animal Owners, suppliers or industry peers or the loss of sales or Customers.\nWe store, process and use information collected from or about our Customers and Animal Owners that subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens and may expose us to liability and/or potential objections from such Customers and Animal Owners, and our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect or appropriately use data could harm our brand, our reputation in the marketplace and our business.\nBecause we collect, store, process and use data, some of which contain personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and other matters related to personal information. Failure to abide by these laws, regulations and standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, investigations, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. Our Customers and Animal Owners may also object to or opt out of the collection and use of their data, which may harm our business.\nCertain states in which we operate, including California, and countries outside of the United States have adopted or may in the future adopt new regulations governing handling, storage, use and protection of personal information. The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) is a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, U.S. Both in the United States and abroad, these laws and regulations continue to evolve and remain subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be required to make significant changes to our products or services, or incur substantial fines, penalties, or other liabilities. For example, if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of our products and services or privacy practices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, new or existing laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our products or services, or increase the costs of doing so, and may affect our ability to invest in or develop products or services. In addition, a determination by a court or government agency that any of our practices do not meet these standards could result in liability or negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) effective from May 25, 2018, which increases privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extends the scope or responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in Europe, or Data Subjects, or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe). Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of total company revenues. Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data. Among other things, the GDPR requires, with respect to personal data concerning Data Subjects, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data, prompt breach notifications within 72 hours, fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored, used or otherwise processed, and data integrity and security, and provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data. Our efforts to implement programs and controls that comply with the GDPR are likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our products or services in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, will be accepted as compliant by applicable regulatory authorities.\nSuccessful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe may launch branding or rebranding initiatives that may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by Customers.\nWe now operate under the name \u201cCovetrus, Inc.\u201d In connection with this name change, we have incurred substantial costs, and may in the future incur substantial additional costs, in rebranding our products and services, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status under the new brand that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed by the Animal Health Business and Vets First Choice separately. The failure of any such rebranding initiative could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, which could cause us not to realize some or all the benefits contemplated by us to result from our acquisition of Vets First Choice in an all-stock transaction (\"Merger\").\nMany of our Customers are small and medium-sized businesses, which can be challenging to cost-effectively reach, acquire, and retain.\nWe market and sell many of our services to veterinary practices and clinics, which are typically small or medium-sized business (\u201cSMBs\u201d). To grow our business, we must develop new customers, sell additional services to existing Customers, and encourage existing Customers to remain on our platform. However, selling to and retaining SMBs can be more difficult than selling to and retaining large enterprises because SMB customers:\n\u2022\nare more price sensitive,\n\u2022\nare more difficult to reach with broad marketing campaigns, and\n\u2022\noften require higher sales, marketing and support expenditures by vendors that sell to them per revenue dollar generated for those vendors.\nIf we are unable to cost-effectively market and sell our services to our target customers, our ability to grow our business will be harmed.\nOur business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions.\nMacroeconomic, business, and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain of our Customers, Animal Owners and our suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from Customers. If one or more of our large Customers discontinue their relationship with us because of economic conditions or otherwise, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk, there can be no assurances such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses. In addition, since Animal Owners typically utilize discretionary income to purchase services or products for their pets, economic concerns may cause some Animal Owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet.\nA significant portion of our operations is conducted in foreign jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, legal, regulatory, and business environments of the countries in which we do business. Risks associated with such international operations could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant operations outside of the United States. We expect that we will continue to expand our international operations in the future. International operations inherently subject us to several risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\ncompliance with governmental controls, trade restrictions, restrictions on direct investments, quotas, embargoes, import and export restrictions, tariffs, duties, and regulatory and licensing requirements by domestic or foreign entities, including restrictions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.K. Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, United Nations Security Council, and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade,\n\u2022\ndifficulties in building, staffing, and managing foreign operations (including a geographically dispersed workforce) and maintaining compliance with foreign labor laws,\n\u2022\nburdens to comply with, and different levels of protection offered by, multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, health and safety requirements and intellectual property,\n\u2022\nchanges in laws, regulations, government controls or enforcement practices with respect to our business and the businesses of our Customers,\n\u2022\npolitical and social instability, including crime, civil disturbance, terrorist activities, armed conflicts, outbreak of disease, and natural and other disasters,\n\u2022\nongoing instability or changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s regulatory, economic, or political conditions, including as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s leaving the European Union, or Brexit, and any other similar referenda or actions by other European Union member countries,\n\u2022\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices prohibited by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations,\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk,\n\u2022\ndisruptions in transportation of our products or our supply chain, and\n\u2022\nthe differing product and service needs of foreign Customers.\nThe multinational nature of our business subjects us to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our cross-border arrangements and subject us to additional tax, adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability. In addition, international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs. Compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology. A failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings, monetary or non-monetary penalties, or both, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation. While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in any of these laws, regulations or requirements, or the political environment in a particular country, may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets, including investment, procurement, and repatriation of earnings.\nBrexit may have a negative effect on our business.\nThe uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the United Kingdom and other countries following Brexit may have a material adverse effect on the movement of products between the United Kingdom and members of the European Union and the United States, including the interruption of or delays in imports into the United Kingdom of products originating within the European Union and exports from the United Kingdom of products originating there. Such a situation could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nApproximately 47% of our net sales for our business in fiscal 2019 was to Customers outside the United States. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact our sales, profits, assets, and liabilities. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of our non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars and could cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations and the expectations of our investors. For our international sales denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the\nvalue of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products and services less competitive in international markets. Alternately, a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we purchase materials and services in foreign markets. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results. While we may use financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our cash flows, unhedged exposures would continue to be subject to currency fluctuations.\nThe future growth of our business depends in significant part on increasing our international sales. Our recent and continuing international expansion efforts subject us to additional risks.\nNet sales outside of the U.S. represented approximately 48% of our total Net sales in 2017, 49% in 2018, and 47% in 2019. Our international expansion efforts may be slow or unsuccessful to the extent we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing and retaining qualified personnel with international experience, language skills and cultural competencies in the geographic markets we target, which could negatively impact our bookings and operating results. Conducting and expanding international operations subjects us to risks we generally do not face in the U.S., including:\n\u2022\nmanagement, communication, and integration problems resulting from language barriers, cultural differences and geographic dispersion of our customers and personnel,\n\u2022\nlanguage translation of, and associated Customer Care support for, our products,\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign laws, including laws regarding online disclaimers, advertising, liability of online service providers for activities of customers especially with respect to hosted content, and more stringent laws in foreign jurisdictions relating to consumer privacy and protection of data collected from individuals and other third parties,\n\u2022\naccreditation and other regulatory requirements to do business and to provide domain name registration, web-hosting and other products in foreign jurisdictions,\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in enforcing contracts, including our universal terms of service and other agreements,\n\u2022\nincreased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations,\n\u2022\ngreater costs and expenses associated with international marketing and operations,\n\u2022\ngreater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, trade disputes and tax laws and treaties,\n\u2022\ndifferent or lesser degrees of protection for our or our customers' intellectual property and free speech rights in certain markets,\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to foreign currency risks,\n\u2022\nincreased risk of a failure of employees to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including export and antitrust regulations, anti-bribery regulations and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices,\n\u2022\nheightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies, and\n\u2022\nthe potential for political, social, or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities or war, and multiple and possibly overlapping tax regimes.\nThe Coronavirus could materially adversely affect our results\nThe Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (\u201cCoronavirus\u201d) is impacting worldwide economic activity, and activity in China in particular. Estimates for Chinese gross domestic product and economic growth have been reduced as a result of the Coronavirus. In addition, with the spread of the Coronavirus to other countries, it is unclear how economic activity might be impacted on a worldwide basis. We also might be unable to obtain products from our suppliers due to the competing demand for such products created by the virus, and by the potential constraints on the movement of goods. The impact of the virus on Chinese and other economic activity, and its effect on the global supply chain are uncertain at this time and could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nOur business is subject to substantial regulation.\nOur pharmacy and supply chain businesses are impacted by federal and state laws and regulations governing, among other things: the purchase, distribution, management, compounding, dispensing, marketing and labeling of prescription drugs and related services; DEA and/or state regulation affecting the sale and distribution of controlled substances; and statutes and regulations related to the sale and marketing of animal drugs, pet food, insecticides and devices. Our failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could severely limit or curtail our pharmacy and supply chain operations, which would materially harm our business and prospects. Further, our business could be affected by changes in these or any newly enacted laws and regulations, as well as federal and state agency interpretations of such statutes and regulations. Such statutory or regulatory changes could\nrequire that we make changes to our business model and operations and/or could require that we incur significantly increased costs to comply with such regulations.\nThe status of compounded animal drugs is uncertain. The FDA issued proposed guidance titled Guidance for Industry #256: Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances (\u201cGFI #256\u201d) on November 18, 2019. The comment period for this proposed guidance will end on June 21, 2020. If adopted, GFI #256 would strictly limit the circumstances under which the FDA would permit compounding of veterinary drug products. It is uncertain whether GFI #256 will be adopted in the form proposed, or at all. The proposed guidance is similar to guidance proposed by the FDA in 2015 and ultimately withdrawn in November 2017. These and other restrictions that may be imposed on the activities of compounding pharmacies may limit the available market for compounded formulations from bulk substances for animal use, as compared to the market available for the FDA-approved animal drugs.\nThe marketing and sale of compounded formulations is subject to and must comply with state statutes and regulations governing compounding pharmacies. These statutes and regulations include, among other things, restrictions on compounding in advance of receiving an animal-specific prescription, restrictions on compounding drugs that are essentially copies of FDA-approved drugs, restrictions on compounding drug products for office use, and restrictions on wholesaling. These and other restrictions on the activities of compounding pharmacies may significantly limit the market available for compounded formulations, as compared to the market available for FDA-approved drugs.\nLegislation may be proposed in the United States or other jurisdictions in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products. For example, such legislation may require veterinarians to provide Animal Owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the Animal Owner may fill prescriptions through a third party, which may further reduce the number of Animal Owners who purchase their animal-health products directly from veterinarians. Such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal-health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe sale and distribution of our products is also regulated in most or all jurisdictions outside the United States where our business operates. Local regulations on sale and distribution may be tightened, for example regarding labeling, quality, or transportation, which may increase our costs of doing business. In the European Union, a revision of the current legislation on veterinary medicinal products is under way, establishing a new EU regulation on veterinary medicinal products will become effective January 28, 2022 throughout the European Union and will limit the use of antibiotics, tighten importation rules, and impose stricter pharmacovigilance standards. This regulation must still be implemented at the member state level and as such, additional requirements may be adopted by individual member states which would have the effect of increasing the compliance requirements for our business in the European Union with resulting costs.\nIf a compounded drug formulation provided through our compounding pharmacy services leads to injury or death or results in a product recall, we may be exposed to liabilities or reputational harm.\nThe success of our compounding pharmacy services is dependent on perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products and services. We could be adversely affected if we or any other compounding pharmacies or our formulations and technologies are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if any of our formulations or technologies, any similar products sold by other companies, or any products sold by other veterinary compounding pharmacies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful. For instance, to the extent any of the components of approved drugs or other ingredients used to produce our compounded formulations have quality or other problems that adversely affect the finished compounded preparations, our business could be adversely affected. Also, because of our dependence on veterinarian and client perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use or misuse of our products, any similar products sold by other companies or any products sold by veterinary compounding pharmacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAssertions by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThe software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of many patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The preparation or sale of our products may infringe on the patent rights of others. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us may grow. Our technology may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Additionally, although we have licensed from other party's proprietary technology covered by patents, it\ncannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. These types of claims could harm our relationships with our Customers, may deter future Customers from using our services or could expose us to litigation for such claims.\nAny intellectual property rights claim against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention and financial resources. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our services to Customers and may require the procurement or development of substitute services that do not infringe. As a result of intellectual property rights claims against us, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology or formulation found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense.\nIn addition, we use open source software in our platform and will use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software, or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional product, technology, and development resources to change our platform or services, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTurnover of key personnel, including executive officers, could disrupt our operations and our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officers or other key positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. The loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers or other key personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented technical, managerial, sales, marketing, and service and support personnel. Competition for sales, marketing, and technology development personnel is particularly intense in the software and technology industries. As a result, we may be unable to successfully attract or retain qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn September 2019, David Shaw resigned as Chairman of our Board of Directors and Benjamin Wolin was appointed as Chairman of our Board of Directors; in October 2019, Benjamin Shaw resigned as our Chief Executive Officer and President, Mr. Wolin resigned as Chairman of our Board of Directors and was appointed Acting Chief Executive Officer and President, and Philip Laskawy was appointed Chairman of our Board of Directors; in December 2019, Christine Komola resigned as our Chief Financial Officer and Stuart Gleichenhaus was appointed as our Interim Chief Financial Officer; and on March 3, 2020, Mr. Wolin was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and President. We may face risks related to these and other transitions in our leadership team.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state, and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted in the United States, which among other things, reduced the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21% and limited the ability to deduct net interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings, in addition to making other significant changes to corporate and international tax provisions. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain how various states will respond to the newly enacted federal tax law.\nRisks Relating to the Transactions\nWe may not realize the anticipated revenue growth opportunities and operational synergies from the Transactions.\nThe benefits that we expect to achieve because of the Transactions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated revenue growth opportunities and operational synergies. Our success in realizing these revenue growth opportunities and operational synergies, and the timing of their realization, depends on the successful integration of the Animal Health Business and the business of Vets First Choice. Even if we can integrate the businesses successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the revenue growth and operational synergies that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all. For example, we may not be able to accelerate the adoption of the Vets First Choice platform by the Animal Health Business\u2019 customers. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the two businesses. Such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the Transactions may be offset by costs or delays incurred in integrating the businesses.\nThe on-going integration of the Animal Health Business and Vets First Choice presents significant challenges that may lead to unforeseen business interruptions or substantial costs.\nThere is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating the Animal Health Business and the Vets First Choice business. These difficulties include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe challenge of integrating the businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of each business,\n\u2022\nthe challenge of integrating the cultures of each business,\n\u2022\nthe challenge of integrating the information technology systems of each business, and\n\u2022\nthe potential difficulty in attracting and retaining key employees and sales personnel of each business.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the businesses and may require us to incur substantial costs. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable time and attention to this integration process, which will decrease the time and attention they will have to manage our operations, service existing Customers, attract new Customers and develop new products, services or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted because of the integration process, our business could suffer. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate the Animal Health Business and Vets First Choice businesses. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe expect that we will incur significant costs associated with the Transactions that could affect our period-to-period operating results.\nWe anticipate that we will incur significant one-time non-recurring costs over the next several years as a result of the Transactions. We may not be able to quantify the exact amount of these costs or the period in which they will be incurred. Some of the factors affecting the costs associated with the Transactions include the resources required in integrating the Animal Health Business and the Vets First Choice businesses and the length of time during which transition services are provided to us by Henry Schein. The amount and timing of these charges, including those related to information technology infrastructure and systems integration and planning, could adversely affect our period-to-period operating results, which could result in a reduction in the market price of shares of our common stock. Moreover, delays in completing the integration may reduce the growth opportunities and operational synergies and other benefits expected from the Transactions and such reduction may be material.\nWe may be unable to access equivalent benefits and services that historically have been provided by Henry Schein to the Animal Health Business.\nThe Animal Health Business previously received benefits and services from Henry Schein and benefitted from Henry Schein\u2019s financial strength and extensive business relationships. We no longer benefit from Henry Schein\u2019s resources, other than pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, dated as of February 7, 2019, by and between Henry Schein and Covetrus, or the Transition Services Agreement, while that agreement is in effect. While Henry Schein will provide certain services to us for a specified period of time under the Transition Services Agreement, those services are transitional in nature and it cannot be assured that we will be able to adequately replace all of the resources provided by Henry Schein to the Animal Health Business or replace them at the same cost. If we are not able to replace the resources provided by Henry Schein, are unable to replace them at the same cost or are delayed in replacing the resources historically provided by Henry Schein, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be affected by significant restrictions imposed on us to avoid significant tax-related liabilities and related indemnification obligations.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2019, by and among Henry Schein, Covetrus, Vets First Choice and the Vets First Choice Stockholders\u2019 Representative (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time), (the \u201cTax Matters Agreement\u201d), generally prohibits us from taking certain actions that could cause the Distribution and the Merger to fail to qualify as tax-free transactions. For a two-year period following the date of the Distribution, we may not (among other limitations):\n\u2022\ncease, or permit certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to cease, the active conduct of a business that was conducted immediately prior to the Distribution or from holding certain assets held at the time of the Distribution,\n\u2022\ndissolve, liquidate, take any action that is a liquidation for federal income tax purposes, merge or consolidate with any other person, or permit certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to do any of the foregoing,\n\u2022\napprove or allow an extraordinary contribution to us by our stockholders in exchange for stock, redeem or otherwise repurchase (directly or indirectly) any of our stock, or amend our certificate of incorporation or other organizational documents, or take any other action, if such amendment or other action would affect the relative voting rights of our capital stock or would be inconsistent with the representations and statements made by us and Henry Schein in connection with the Opinion of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, to the effect that the contribution of the Animal Health Business, the Distribution and certain related transactions will qualify as tax free to Henry Schein and Henry Schein stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the \u201cSpin-off Tax Opinion\u201d), or\n\u2022\nenter into any transaction or series of transactions as a result of which one or more persons would acquire (directly or indirectly) an amount of stock of Covetrus (taking into account the stock of Covetrus acquired pursuant to the Merger and Share Sale (as defined below)) that would reasonably be expected to cause the failure of the tax-free status of the Distribution, the Merger and certain related transactions.\nIn addition, we may not amend our certificate of incorporation or take any other action that would render ineffective the application of the Ownership Limitation (as defined below), and in certain circumstances this restriction may prevent us from taking certain actions even following the second anniversary of the Distribution. The Tax Matters Agreement also imposes additional obligations and restrictions on us related to the Ownership Limitation, including a requirement that we diligently enforce the provisions of the Ownership Limitation against any purported transfers in violation of its terms, and we may have an obligation to indemnify Henry Schein if we breach or otherwise fail to comply with these restrictions. Due to these and other restrictions and indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement, we may be limited in our ability to pursue strategic transactions, equity or convertible debt financings or other transactions that may otherwise be in our best interests. Also, our potential indemnity obligations to Henry Schein might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control during this two-year period that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nIf the Distribution does not qualify as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock, then we may have certain indemnification obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Transactions were conditioned on Henry Schein\u2019s and our receipt of the Spin-off Tax Opinion. The parties did not obtain a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) with respect to the Transactions, and instead intend to rely solely on the Spin-off Tax Opinion for comfort that the spin-off and certain related transactions qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The Spin-off Tax Opinion is based on, among other things, certain representations, and assumptions as to factual matters, as well as certain undertakings, made by us. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct, and complete in all material respects, or any undertakings to be fully complied with, could affect the validity of the Spin-off Tax Opinion. An opinion of counsel represents counsel\u2019s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the conclusions set forth in the Spin-off Tax Opinion. In addition, the Spin-off Tax Opinion was based on current law, and cannot be relied on if current law changes with retroactive effect.\nIf the Transactions do not qualify for their intended tax-free treatment, including as a result of our failure to comply with the restrictions in the Tax Matters Agreement or subsequent acquisitions of our stock, we may have an obligation under the Tax Matters Agreement to indemnify Henry Schein for the resulting tax liability (which may be significant). In the event we are required to indemnify Henry Schein for taxes incurred in connection with the Transactions, the indemnification obligation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes a share ownership limitation that, for a two-year period following the Distribution, may prevent certain transfers of our shares.\nIn order to minimize the likelihood that an acquisition of our capital stock by one or more persons (or coordinating groups of persons) after the Distribution could be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation generally prohibits, for the two-year period following the Distribution, direct or indirect beneficial ownership (taking into account applicable ownership provisions of the Code) and any agreement, understanding, or substantial negotiations to acquire beneficial ownership, by any person or persons of more than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or any other class or series of outstanding stock) or, in the case of certain grandfathered holders of more than the requisite percentage of such stock held by such investor, or collectively, the Ownership Limitation. Any attempted transfer of our stock which, if effective, would result in a violation of the relevant Ownership Limitation will be null and void ab initio, and will cause the shares in excess of such Ownership Limitation (rounded up to the nearest whole share) to be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries, and the proposed transferee would not acquire any rights in the shares. A transfer for this purpose will include not only direct transfers, but also other direct and indirect changes in beneficial ownership. The trustee of the trust will receive all distributions on, and will exercise all voting rights in respect of, the shares in trust for the exclusive benefit of the charitable beneficiary. In addition, the trustee would be empowered to sell the shares in trust to a qualified person selected by the trustee, under procedures set out in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, with all of the net profit being received by the trustee for the exclusive benefit of the charitable beneficiary. In the event that the shares-in-trust shall have been sold by the purported transferee in an open market transaction, such sale would be deemed to have been made on behalf of the trustee and all of the net profit, if any, from such sale shall be paid by the purported transferee to the trustee for the exclusive benefit of the charitable beneficiary. The purported transferee of the shares in trust would have no right to share in any profit that may be realized in respect of such shares.\nOur Board has the power to waive the relevant Ownership Limitation for specific transfers after following procedures set out in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, other than in respect of certain transfers that meet certain requirements described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our Board is not obligated to grant a waiver. In addition, our ability to modify the relevant restrictions set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is limited by the Tax Matters Agreement.\nThe Ownership Limitation is intended to help preserve the tax-free treatment of the Distribution under Section 355 of the Code, but it is possible the restriction could depress the price of shares of our common stock, and, in certain circumstances while the Ownership Limitation is in effect, could inhibit proxy contests to change our Board or delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of us that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or that might otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nDue to the Merger, our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be restricted and these net operating losses could expire or otherwise be unavailable.\nDue to the Merger, our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income will be further restricted and these net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) could expire or otherwise be unavailable. In general, under Section 382 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation\u2019s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. Prior to the Merger, some of Vets First Choice\u2019s existing NOLs were subject to limitations. Following the Merger, Vets First Choice\u2019s existing NOLs may be subject to further limitations and we may not be able to fully use these NOLs to offset future taxable income. In addition, if we undergo any subsequent ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited. There is also a risk that, due to regulatory changes or for other unforeseen reasons, existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nAdditionally, the Tax Act (as defined below) resulted in a reduction in the economic benefit of the NOLs and other deferred tax assets available to us. Under the Tax Act, U.S. federal NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 will not be subject to expiration.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them, or at all.\nPrior to the Distribution date, there was no public market for our common stock. A limited market, commonly known as a \u201cwhen-issued\u201d trading market, for our common stock developed on February 4, 2019 and \u201cregular-way\u201d trading of our common stock (Nasdaq: CVET) began on February 8, 2019. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses,\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies,\n\u2022\nannouncements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors,\n\u2022\nannouncements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry,\n\u2022\nsignificant sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market,\n\u2022\nvariations in interest rates,\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of other comparable companies, and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research about us or cease to provide coverage of us, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. If one or more of the securities and industry analysts who cover our stock downgrades the stock or publishes unfavorable research about us, the stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause the stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, due to a number of factors, including: seasonality of certain product lines; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in our accounting estimates; timing of operating expenditures; and timing of regulatory approvals and licenses, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock. Furthermore, our results may fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failure to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if any forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue and/or earnings guidance we may provide.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by a negative outcome in significant litigation or other legal proceedings.\nWe are currently involved in a shareholder securities litigation, and may be subject to future litigation matters, claims, and demands. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution or outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims, demands or investigations could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our ability to report our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows accurately and on a timely basis and could harm our reputation.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nTo comply with these requirements, we have and will need to continue to upgrade and implement additional internal controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures, and hire additional accounting, legal, compliance, and finance staff. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that results in a more than reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2019, management identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGC\u2019s) in the areas of logical security and change management in certain of our business units within North America, APAC, and Europe. As a result of this material weakness, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2019 and through December 31, 2019.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2019, management identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our accounting for income taxes. Management's assessment identified control deficiencies associated with the transition to establishing expanded in-house tax capabilities and utilizing new tax consultants. As a result of these issues, our controls to review and analyze the Company's income tax provision and deferred income tax balances did not operate effectively. That led management to conclude that the control deficiencies that existed at December 31, 2019 represented a material weakness in internal controls.\nWe are implementing remedial measures to address the material weaknesses prior to the end of fiscal 2020, however we cannot assure that our efforts will be successful or on this timeline, or that we have identified all material weaknesses. Our remedial measures may result in additional technology and other expenses. Any failure to implement these remedial measures and to achieve and maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the market for our common stock.\nFor a discussion of our internal controls over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness, see Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures of this Report.\nSales of our common stock may negatively affect its market price.\nIt is likely that some stockholders have sold or may sell our common stock received in the Transactions for various reasons such as if our business profile or market capitalization as a combined company does not fit their investment objectives. The sales of significant amounts of our common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. Certain former stockholders of Vets First Choice holding approximately 17.3% of our common stock were subject to a six-month lock-up period following February 7, 2019, or the Closing Date, with respect to the shares of our common stock they received in the Merger pursuant to a voting and support agreement. These shares were not restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act after the expiration of the lock-up period and, unless held by our affiliates, may subsequently be sold into the public market without restriction. If some or all these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth, to develop our business, for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend on any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the value of shares received in connection with the Transactions. In addition, Delaware law or the agreements governing our indebtedness may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nUnder our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our non-employee directors generally have no obligation to offer us corporate opportunities.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation addresses potential conflicts of interest with respect to corporate opportunities and transactions that are presented to, or which otherwise come into the possession of, any of our directors who is not also one of our employees or an employee of any of our subsidiaries. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we renounce any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunities unless they were presented to a non-employee director expressly and solely in such person\u2019s capacity as one of our directors.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws could discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, collectively:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board without approval of stockholders,\n\u2022\nfor the first three years following the Merger until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, divide our Board into three classes, serving staggered terms of one, two and three years, respectively,\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to remove directors by requiring the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote for removal and, until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, permitting directors to be removed only with cause,\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office,\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders,\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent,\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of candidates for election as directors before an annual or special meeting of our stockholders or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders,\n\u2022\nsubject us to Section 203 of the DGCL, which will prohibit us from engaging in business combinations with certain \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for three years following the date such stockholder became interested unless certain criteria are met, and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote to amend the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated by-laws.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of the common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. The amended and restated by-laws also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove management by giving our Board the sole ability to elect and remove officers. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of the stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware (each such court, as applicable, the \u201cSelected Forum\u201d), as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Selected Forum will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on a Selected Forum, (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, (v) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws, or (vi) any other action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d under Section 115 of the DGCL. If a stockholder files any of the preceding actions in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a \u201cForeign Action\u201d), such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (x) the personal jurisdiction of the Selected Forum in connection with any action brought in such court to enforce the choice of forum provision and (y) having service of process made on such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service on the stockholder\u2019s counsel (as such stockholder\u2019s agent) in the foreign action. By becoming a holder of our common stock, a person will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of\nforum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 18327, "SIC": 5912, "TIC": "CVET"}
