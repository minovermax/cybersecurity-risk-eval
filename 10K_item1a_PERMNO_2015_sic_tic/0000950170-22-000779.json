{"cik": "716006", "company": "Yellow Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report or in our other SEC filings, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition (including our liquidity), results of operations and cash flows.\nBusiness Risks\nDifficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could result in increases in driver compensation and purchased transportation costs and could adversely affect our growth potential and profitability.\nWe need to attract new qualified drivers and may face difficulty doing so. Like many in the trucking industry, it is important to our business that we retain the necessary number of qualified drivers to operate efficiently. Regulatory requirements, including the Compliance Safety Accountability program (\u201cCSA\u201d) of the FMCSA, have reduced the number of eligible employee drivers and independent contractors and may continue to do so in the future. Future Company driver shortages may result in less than optimal use of rail and over-the-road purchased transportation, which may result in higher costs to the Company and which use is limited under our collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"IBT\"). The compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions, and we may find it necessary to increase driver compensation, including both wages and benefits, in future periods if we must attract new drivers. In addition, we and our industry suffer from a high driver turnover rate. Driver turnover requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers in order to operate existing revenue equipment. If we are unable to continue to retain drivers and attract new drivers when needed, we could be required to adjust our compensation packages, increase our use of purchased transportation, or let tractors sit idle, any of which would adversely affect our growth potential and profitability.\nIn response to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local agencies could issue laws, regulations, and orders requiring that our employees be vaccinated or that we test unvaccinated employees for COVID-19, which requirements could materially adversely affect the Company's operations.\nWe could be subject to a future standard from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or requirement from another governmental agency or body, whether federal, state or local, compelling us to require that our employees be vaccinated and/or requiring that we regularly test unvaccinated employees for COVID-19. For example, on September 9, 2021, the President of the United States issued Executive Order (\"EO\") 14042, requiring that employees of federal contractors and subcontractors be fully\nvaccinated against COVID-19 by December 8, 2021. The enforceability of the EO has been subject to numerous lawsuits and is currently subject to a number of injunctions. As a result, the order is not being enforced by the federal government. We do business with many departments and agencies of the federal government and could be subject to the terms of the EO. If the EO or any such other standard or mandate becomes effective, applicable to us, and actively enforced, we could be required to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for our covered employees and/or implement a costly testing program. Any such requirements that apply to us will would likely exacerbate the industry-wide driver shortages that we are currently experiencing and could otherwise have a material adverse impact on our ability to serve our customers and on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could have the ability to take actions to minimize the cost or other negative impact of the standard or mandate, such as limiting the business that could cause us to be subject to the requirement. However, any such action could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our relationship with our employees and unions were to deteriorate, we may be faced with increased labor costs, labor disruptions or stoppages or general uncertainty by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, result in a loss of customers, and place us at a disadvantage relative to competitors.\nEach of our operating subsidiaries has employees who are represented by the IBT. These employees represented approximately 80% of our workforce at December 31, 2021. Salaries, wages and employee benefits for both union and non-union employees compose over half of our operating costs, which for union employees include multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans. The labor and benefit expenses associated with the union employees are subject to regular negotiation with the IBT primarily upon the expiration of union labor agreements. Each of our YRC Freight, New Penn, Holland and Reddaway subsidiaries employ most of their unionized employees under the terms of a common master collective bargaining agreement and related supplemental agreements that remain in effect through March 31, 2024. The IBT also represents a number of employees at YRC Freight in Canada under more localized agreements, which have wages, benefit contributions and other terms and conditions that we believe better fit the cost structure and operating models of this entity.\nOur subsidiaries are regularly subject to grievances, arbitration proceedings and other claims concerning alleged past and current non-compliance with applicable labor law and collective bargaining agreements. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters. These matters, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general economic factors that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to a number of general economic factors, including the health of the industrial economy, global trade tensions, global or national health epidemics and pandemics such as the widespread outbreak of COVID-19, among others that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, many of which are largely out of our control. These factors include recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles and changes in their business practices, particularly in market segments and industries, such as retail and manufacturing, where we have a significant concentration of customers. Economic conditions may adversely affect our customers\u2019 business levels, the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services. Because a portion of our costs are fixed, it may be difficult for us to quickly adjust our cost structure proportionally with fluctuations in volume levels. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses. Further, we depend on our suppliers for equipment, parts and services that are critical to our business. A disruption in the availability of these supplies or a material increase in their cost due to adverse economic conditions or financial constraints of our suppliers could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, as well as regulatory measures implemented in response to such events, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020 has continued through 2021 as new variants of the virus spread rapidly around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, adversely impact economic activity and business conditions worldwide. Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 have led governments and other authorities to impose vaccination requirements and restrictions such as travel bans and limits, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, increased border and port controls, and closures and shutdowns which have resulted in business closures and disrupted supply chains worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to prevent its spread have, at certain times, throughout 2020 negatively impacted demand for our services, and thus our shipment and tonnage levels, and has prevented us from delivering some freight in our network due to recipients that have closed their businesses to deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur 2020 results of operations were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although our business operations returned to more normal levels throughout 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuation of COVID-19 related social and economic disruptions may lead to other events which could negatively impact our operations, including limited availability of drivers and other key employees, reductions in operating efficiencies and increased security risks due to employees working remotely, reductions in the supply of necessary capital equipment, industry-wide excess capacity or rate reductions, reductions in the supply of capital equipment, an increase in our pension funding obligations due to market volatility, the credit-worthiness of our customers, or volatile financial credit markets.\nGiven the amount of economic uncertainty, including uncertainty about how and when federal, state and local governments will impose vaccination mandates or lift business and travel restrictions or put new restrictions in place, it is difficult to predict whether we will experience any additional negative effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, government restrictions altered or imposed in response to the pandemic, the continued development and availability of effective treatments, and the further development and use of vaccines and boosters. Continuing or new periods of economic disruption or volatility and related declines in industrial production and manufacturing, consumer spending, and demand for our services, as well as the ability of our customers and other business partners to fulfill their obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business and could also be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of any other illness or any other communicable disease or other public health crisis. Measures intended to prevent the spread of a health epidemic could also have an adverse effect on our business\nWe may experience disruptions of our computer and information technology systems, privacy breaches and sophisticated cyber-attacks, which could adversely affect our business and increase our data and system security costs.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. In addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. These systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks (including denial of service, ransom or other attacks), malicious insiders, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events.\nWe seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls. However, information technology security threats are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these threats or to implement adequate preventative measures. Additionally, with a portion of our employees working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be increased opportunities for unauthorized access and cyber-attacks.\nSecurity breaches and information technology disruptions could create financial liability, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders, result in loss or misuse of proprietary or competitively sensitive information, compromise personally identifiable information, delay our ability to deliver services to customers, and jeopardize the security of our facilities. Breaches and disruptions could also result in a violation of U.S. and international privacy and other laws and subject us to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings or sanctions. Any of these occurrences could result in the loss of existing or potential customers and have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches may not be successful.\nWe are subject to business risks and increasing costs associated with the transportation industry that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to business risks and increasing costs associated with the transportation industry that are largely out of our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The factors contributing to these risks and costs include increasing equipment and operational costs, weather, fuel prices, interest rates, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, license and registration fees, potential harm by security measures associated with anti-terrorism concerns and excess capacity in the transportation industry, as well as the other factors discussed in this risk factor section. Further, we periodically need to upgrade or change our technology systems, which may be costly and could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business will suffer if we are unable to adapt to competitive pressures which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNumerous competitive factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These factors include the following:\n\u2022We compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and types, many of which have a lower cost structure, more and/or newer equipment and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages;\n\u2022Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain or grow our business;\n\u2022Our customers may negotiate rates or contracts that minimize or eliminate our ability to offset fuel prices through fuel surcharges;\n\u2022Many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called \u201ccore carriers\u201d as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected;\n\u2022Many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors;\n\u2022The trend towards consolidation in the ground transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size;\n\u2022Advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments;\n\u2022Brand recognition and strength is of ongoing importance and can be impacted, suddenly or over time, by factors such as adverse publicity and environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) perceptions or profile ratings in the rapidly evolving field of ESG analysis;\n\u2022Competition from non-asset-based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and prices; and\n\u2022As a union carrier, we may have a competitive disadvantage compared to non-union carriers with lower costs and greater operating flexibility.\nOngoing self-insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels. We currently self-insure for a majority of our claims exposure resulting from workers\u2019 compensation, third-party liability claims, and cargo, supplemented by high deductible purchased insurance. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may have to post additional letters of credit or cash collateral to state workers\u2019 compensation authorities or insurers to support our insurance policies, which may adversely affect our liquidity. If we lose our ability to self-insure or have to increase retention limits to offset rising insurance premium costs our insurance costs could materially increase, and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage.\nOur self-insured retention limits can make our insurance and claims expense higher and/or more volatile. We accrue for the costs of the uninsured portion of pending claims based on the nature and severity of individual claims and historical claims development trends. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts is inherently difficult. This, along with legal expenses associated with claims, incurred but not reported claims, and other uncertainties can cause unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates.\nIn general, our insurance coverage with respect to each of workers\u2019 compensation, property damage and liability claims, and cargo claims is subject to policy limits. Although we believe our aggregate insurance policy limits are sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed those limits. In this case, we would bear the excess expense, in addition to the amount of our self-insurance retention. Our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we could find it necessary to raise our self-insured retention or decrease our aggregate coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced.\nWe operate in an industry subject to extensive government regulations, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could significantly increase our costs of doing business.\nThe U.S. Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security and various federal, state, local and foreign agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and permits to conduct transportation business. Our drivers are also subject to hours-of-service rules of the FMCSA. In the future, we may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations that the FMCSA, Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the EPA or other authorities impose, including regulations relating\nto engine exhaust emissions, the hours of service that our drivers may provide in any one-time period, security and other matters. Compliance with these regulations could substantially impair productivity and increase our costs.\nThe FMCSA\u2019s CSA program is a motor carrier data-driven oversight program under which drivers and fleets are evaluated based on certain safety-related standards. Carriers\u2019 safety and fitness ratings under CSA include the on-road safety performance of the carriers\u2019 drivers. At any given time, there are also other proposals for safety related standards that are pending legislative or administrative approval or adoption. If additional or more stringent standards are adopted, such may result in a reduction of the pool of qualified drivers available for employment by us. If we experience safety and fitness violations, our safety and fitness scores could be adversely impacted and our fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to our peers. A reduction in our safety and fitness scores or those of our drivers could also reduce our competitiveness in relation to other companies that have higher scores. Additionally, competition for qualified drivers with favorable safety ratings may increase and thus result in increases in driver-related recruiting and compensation costs.\nLike many motor carriers, we compensate our drivers based primarily on mileage rate and activity-based formulas. The state of California adopted legislation that sets forth requirements for the payment of a separate hourly wage for \u201cnonproductive\u201d time worked by 13 piece-rate employees, and separate payment for compensable rest and recovery periods to those employees. Specifically, that legislation, effective since January 1, 2016, codified three basic statutory requirements for the payment of employees on a piece-rate basis: (i) employees must be separately compensated at their regular rate for the time during which they take rest and recovery breaks; (ii) employees must be separately compensated for \u201cother nonproductive time,\u201d which is defined as \u201ctime under the employer\u2019s control, exclusive of rest and recovery periods, that is not directly related to the activity being compensated on a piece-rate basis;\u201d and (iii) this \u201cother nonproduction time\u201d time must be compensated at an hourly rate no less than the applicable minimum wage. The application of this legislation to the Company and its operations has increased our operating costs, including labor costs and legal exposure.\nCurrent or future litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have been and continue to be involved in legal proceedings, claims and other litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation may be related to labor and employment, competitive matters, third-party liability claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability, our past financial restructurings and other matters. We discuss legal proceedings in the \u201cCommitments, Contingencies, and Uncertainties\u201d footnote to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as in \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d in Part I hereof. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost and ability to obtain insurance in the future. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, including to our management due to the increased time and resources required to respond to and address the litigation. The results of complex legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict. An unfavorable outcome of any particular matter or any future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the future, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various environmental regulations and climate change initiatives, and costs of compliance with, or liabilities for violations of, existing or future laws, regulations and initiatives could significantly increase our costs of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to Environmental Regulations dealing with, among other things, the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and the discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, among others. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable environmental laws or regulations, it could significantly increase our cost of doing business. Under specific environmental laws and regulations, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our past or present terminals and at third-party waste disposal sites. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.\nIn addition, as climate change initiatives become more prevalent, federal, state and local governments and our customers and investors could increase focus on greenhouse gas emission reductions and corporate environmental sustainability, which may result in new regulations and customer or investor demands. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations or respond to customer demands. We could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements. These costs, changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits and cost savings from operational changes and performance improvement initiatives.\nWe initiate operational changes and process improvements to reduce costs and improve financial performance. These changes and initiatives typically include evaluating management talent, reducing overhead costs, closing facilities, making upgrades to our technology, eliminating non-core assets and unnecessary activities and implementing changes of operations under our labor agreements. There is no assurance that any changes and improvements will be successful, that their implementation may not have an adverse impact on our operating results or that we will not have to initiate additional changes and improvements in order to achieve the projected benefits and cost savings.\nWe are dependent on the services of key employees and the loss of any substantial number of these individuals or an inability to hire additional personnel could adversely affect us.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain skilled employees, particularly personnel with significant management and leadership skills. If we are unable to attract and retain skilled key employees, we may be unable to accomplish the objectives set forth in our business and strategic plans. Further, compensation for many of these key employees is limited by the terms of our UST Tranche A Loan Credit Agreement (the \u201cTranche A UST Credit Agreement\u201d) entered into by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors (the \u201cTerm Guarantors\u201d), with The Bank of New York Mellon, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the UST Tranche B Term Loan Credit Agreement (the \u201cTranche B UST Credit Agreement\u201d) entered into by the Company and Term Guarantors, with The Bank of New York Mellon, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the Tranche A UST Credit Agreement and the Tranche B UST Credit Agreement are collectively referred to herein as, the \u201cUST Credit Agreements\u201d).\nWe have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations.\nOur business is capital intensive and we will need to continue to update our fleet. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash over an extended period of time from operations to fund our capital requirements, we may have to limit our growth, utilize our existing liquidity, or enter into additional financing arrangements, including leasing arrangements, or operate our revenue equipment (including tractors and trailers) for longer periods resulting in increased maintenance costs, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations and other financial measures. If our cash from operations and existing financing arrangements is not sufficient to fund our current and longer-term capital expenditure requirements, then we may not be able to obtain additional financing at all or on terms acceptable to us.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather affect our operations and profitability.\nAs is common in the trucking industry, our revenues are subject to seasonal variations. During late fourth quarter and early first quarter each year, we normally would expect operating expenses as a percent of revenue to increase and operating cash flows as a percent of revenue to decrease as compared to the rest of the year. The seasonal impact is primarily due to inclement weather, seasonally lower levels of shipments, and the seasonal timing of expenditures. We anticipate these seasonal trends will continue to impact our financial results and liquidity. Volatile changes in weather conditions, including extreme heat or cold, could increase the risk of wildfires, floods, blizzards, hurricanes and other weather-related disasters, which could impact our ability to timely meet, or increase the cost of meeting, our obligations, impacting our financial results.\nChanges in fuel prices and shortages of fuel can have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and profitability.\nTo lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on our margins, we utilize a fuel surcharge program with our customers. These programs are common in the trucking industry and involve adjusting amounts charged to customers as fuel prices fluctuate. In the short term, under our present fuel surcharge program, rising fuel costs generally benefit us while falling fuel costs have a negative impact on our results of operations, though these effects are typically moderated over time. However, rapid material changes in the index upon which we base our program or our cost of fuel could significantly impact our revenue and operating income, resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, fuel shortages and petroleum product rationing could have a material adverse impact on our operations and profitability.\nDamage to our corporate reputation may cause our business to suffer.\nOur business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the positive image of our brand. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party contract carriers and their drivers\nand owner operators or other third-party service providers, could adversely impact our customers\u2019 image of our brands and result in the loss of business. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, cybersecurity and data privacy concerns, environmental and sustainability issues, other ESG matters and analyses, and similar matters, even when based on erroneous information, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and, thus, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.\nWe face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nWe conduct a portion of our operations in Canada and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. As a participating carrier in the Customs and Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (\u201cC-TPAT\u201d) program, we and our contractors are able to cross into these countries more efficiently, thereby avoiding substantial delays. If we should lose the ability to participate in the C-TPAT program, we could experience significant border delays which could have a negative impact on our ability to remain competitive and operate efficiently in those countries.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including, but not limited to, compliance with the requirements of applicable anti-bribery laws (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), political instability, controls on the repatriation of cash, currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers.\nFinancial and Liquidity Risks\nOur failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our existing and future indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity.\nThe documents governing our indebtedness contain financial covenants, affirmative covenants requiring us to take certain actions and negative covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions. The UST Credit Agreements and Term Loan Agreement require a minimum trailing-twelve-month (\"TTM\") Adjusted EBITDA measured quarterly. Management expects, based on actual and forecasted operating results, the Company will meet this covenant requirement for the period it became effective and the next twelve months. The UST Credit Agreements also require us and our affiliates to comply with certain requirements in connection with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), including (i) limitations on executive compensation and (ii) until 12 months following the repayments of the UST Credit Agreements, we may not pay any dividends or make any other capital distributions with respect to our common stock.\nOur ability to satisfy these financial covenants could be impacted by significant adverse conditions beyond our control, changes in global trade policies or increased contraction in the general economy. If we are unable to achieve the results required to comply with the applicable financial covenants, we may be required to take specific actions to reduce operating costs, as well as specific initiatives in the areas of pricing and customer engagement, and other operational actions to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as increased volume. If we are unable to satisfy our financial covenants or obtain a waiver or an amendment from our lenders, or take other remedial measures, we will be in default under our credit facilities, which would enable lenders thereunder to accelerate the repayment of amounts outstanding and exercise remedies with respect to the collateral. If our lenders under our credit facilities demand payment, we will not have sufficient cash to repay such indebtedness. In addition, a default under our credit facilities or the lenders exercising their remedies thereunder could trigger cross-default provisions in our other indebtedness and certain other operating agreements as well as increase our funding obligations under our pension plans. Our ability to amend our credit facilities or otherwise obtain waivers from our lenders depends on matters that are outside of our control and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in that regard. In addition, any covenant breach or event of default could harm our credit rating and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur indebtedness and cash interest payment obligations, lease obligations and pension funding obligations, as well as our liquidity position, could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $1,614.5 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness. We also have, and will continue to have, substantial lease obligations. As of December 31, 2021, our expected minimum cash payments for our operating leases for 2022 are $94.4 million, and our total operating lease obligations payable through 2031 are $245.6 million. We expect our required contributions in 2022 under our multi-employer pension funds will be approximately $112.1 million and any contributions, if required, for non-union single-employer pension plans will be nominal. Our indebtedness, lease obligations and pension funding obligations could continue to have an impact on our business. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under our ABL Facility and any prospective cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2021, our availability under our ABL facility was $93.1 million and our Managed Accessibility was $48.1 million.\n\u201cManaged Accessibility\u201d represents the maximum amount we would access on the ABL Facility and is adjusted for eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash measured as of December 31, 2021. If eligible receivables fall below the threshold management uses to measure availability, which is 10% of the borrowing line, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility permits adjustments from eligible borrowing base cash to restricted cash prior to the compliance measurement date. Cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility totaled $358.8 million at December 31, 2021.\nFor example, these obligations and liquidity limitations could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse changes or persistent slow growth in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, leases and pension funding obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022restrict us from taking advantage of business opportunities;\n\u2022make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations and meet future stepped up financial covenants in our credit facilities;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt, lease obligations, and pension funding obligations; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur ability to service all of our indebtedness and satisfy all of other obligations depends on many factors beyond our control, and if we cannot generate enough cash to service our indebtedness and satisfy such other obligations, we may be forced to take one or more actions, which may not be successful.\nCash flows from operations are a principal source of funding for us. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our indebtedness and satisfy our other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness or other financial obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates. In addition, any refinancing of our indebtedness or restructuring of our other obligations may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations and limit our financial flexibility. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness or satisfy our other financial obligations on a timely basis would likely result in a lowering of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and, as a result, our liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected and we may not be able to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our outstanding debt.\nRestrictive covenants in the documents governing our existing and future indebtedness may limit our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies.\nThe documents governing our existing indebtedness contain, and the documents governing any future indebtedness will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest. The documents governing our existing indebtedness, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022make certain restricted payments or investments;\n\u2022enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create or incur liens;\n\u2022enter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022compensate certain executives;\n\u2022pay dividends or make any other capital distributions with respect to our Common Stock, as discussed under Risks Related to Our Common Stock;\n\u2022purchase shares of our Common Stock in the public market;\n\u2022merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022make certain investments and acquire certain assets.\nThe restrictions could adversely affect our ability to:\n\u2022finance our operations;\n\u2022make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;\n\u2022withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u2022attract and retain skilled key employees;\n\u2022engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and\n\u2022plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nOur ability to obtain future financing or to sell assets could be adversely affected because substantially all of our assets have been pledged as collateral for the benefit of the holders of our indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult to resell our Common Stock when holders want or at prices they find attractive.\nThe market price for our Common Stock has been highly volatile and subject to significant fluctuations. We expect the market price of our Common Stock to continue to be volatile and subject to these fluctuations in response to a wide variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of securities of similar companies;\n\u2022labor disputes;\n\u2022general market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets;\n\u2022large blocks of stockholders selling via automated trading systems;\n\u2022variations in our operating results, or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022changes in our financial guidance, if any, or securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022sales of large blocks of our Common Stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022additions or departures of any of our key personnel;\n\u2022announcements related to litigation;\n\u2022changing legal or regulatory developments in the United States and other countries; and\n\u2022commentary about us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.\nIn addition, the stock markets from time to time experience price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies and that may be extreme. These fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFuture issuances of our Common Stock or equity-related securities in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of our Common Stock to raise capital or in connection with a restructuring or refinancing of our indebtedness. In addition, approximately 1.9 million shares of our Common Stock remain available and are reserved for issuance, exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of outstanding share units. Under our 2019 Incentive and Equity Award Plan (the \u201c2019 Plan\u201d), we have registered under the Securities Act all of the shares of Common Stock that we may issue upon the exercise of our outstanding options and the vesting of outstanding share units and on account of future awards made under the 2019 Plan. Our 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan has approximately 2.9 million shares of Common Stock reserved for eligible employee participants. All of these registered shares generally can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that such issuances may have on the market price for our Common Stock. Sales of significant amounts of our Common Stock or equity-related securities in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. Further sales of shares of our Common Stock or the availability of shares of our Common Stock for future sale or in connection with hedging and arbitrage activity that may develop with respect to our Common Stock, could adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe are not permitted to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe are not permitted to pay any dividends on shares of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future due to the documents governing our indebtedness. We intend to retain any future earnings to fund operations, invest in capital requirements, to service\ndebt and other obligations, such as lease and pension funding requirements, and to use for other corporate needs. Further, we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends on shares of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of holders of our Common Stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of 7.5 million shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors is authorized to approve the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock without further authorization of our shareholders and to fix the number of shares, the designations, the relative rights and the limitations of any series of preferred stock. As a result, our Board, without shareholder approval, could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, conversion and other rights that could proportionately reduce, minimize or otherwise adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of our Common Stock or other series of preferred stock or that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control.", "PERMNO": 59483, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "YRCW"}
