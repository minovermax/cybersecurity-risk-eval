Risk Factors\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this Form 10-K include certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Those statements include, but may not be limited to, all statements regarding the intent, belief and expectations of the Company and its management, such as statements concerning the Company's future profitability. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, factors detailed from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K will prove to be accurate, and in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved. The Company encounters a number of risks in the conduct of its business. A discussion of such risks follows.\nThe Company is subject to a number of general categories of risks that may adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations, many of which are outside of management\u2019s direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the types of risks assumed are: (1) credit risk, which the risk of loss due to loan customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (2) market risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads, (3) liquidity risk, which is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro market issues, investor and\nIndex\ncustomer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to the Company such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues, and (4) operational risk, which is the risk of loss due to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks.\nIf one or more of the factors affecting our forward looking statements proves inaccurate, then our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed or implied by forward-looking statements contained herein. Therefore, we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, we will not update our forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, performance or achievements.\nIn addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could materially impact the Company\u2019s business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are significantly dependent on economic conditions and related uncertainties. Commercial banking is affected, directly and indirectly, by domestic and international economic and political conditions and by governmental monetary and fiscal policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, real estate values, government monetary policy, international conflicts, the actions of terrorists and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in interest rates, in particular, could adversely affect our net interest income and have a number of other adverse effects on our operations, as discussed in the immediately succeeding risk factor. Adverse economic conditions also could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures and nonperforming assets and a decrease in the value of the property or other collateral which secures our loans, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. We are particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and related uncertainties in Northeast Ohio because we derive substantially all of our loans, deposits and other business from this area. Accordingly, we remain subject to the risks associated with prolonged declines in national or local economies. The current economic climate, with associated legislative, regulatory, fiscal and monetary policy initiatives, may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. One example of this effect is the Federal Reserve\u2019s accommodative monetary policy, that has kept interest rates low for a prolonged period of time and has potentially had other macroeconomic effects such as an increase in housing prices in excess of fundamental values (a so-called \u201cbubble\u201d) and a prolonged increase in stock market values.\nChanges in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The operations of financial institutions such as the Bank are dependent to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income by affecting the difference between the weighted-average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the weighted-average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, and the average life of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate loans; the value of our interest-earning assets; our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental fiscal and monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Although we believe that the estimated maturities of our interest-earning assets currently are well balanced in relation to the estimated maturities of our interest-bearing liabilities (which involves various estimates as to how changes in the general level of interest rates will impact these assets and liabilities), there can be no assurance that our profitability would not be adversely affected during any period of changes in interest rates. In addition, the prolonged period of low interest rates in recent years has potentially altered consumer behavior with respect\nIndex\nto loans and deposits, increasing regulatory scrutiny of interest rate risk management processes and increasing the difficulty of modeling potential future consumer behaviors and the risk of an incorrect forecast of profitability under a variety of potential interest rate scenarios.\nThe strength and stability of other financial institutions may adversely affect our business. The actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions could affect the Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to different industries and counterparties, and executes transactions with various counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, mutual funds and other institutional clients. Rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may increase when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan. Any such losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere are increased risks involved with commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer lending activities. Our lending activities include loans secured by existing commercial real estate. Commercial real estate lending generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single-family residential lending due to a variety of factors, including generally larger loan balances, the dependency on successful completion or operation of the project for repayment, the difficulties in estimating loan terms which often do not require full amortization of the loan over its term and, instead, provide for a balloon payment at stated maturity. Our lending activities also include commercial business loans to small- to medium-sized businesses, which generally are secured by various equipment, machinery and other corporate assets, and a wide variety of consumer loans, including home equity and second mortgage loans, automobile loans, deposit account secured loans and unsecured loans. Although commercial business loans and consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans, they generally involve more risk than mortgage loans because of the nature of, or in certain cases the absence of, the collateral which secures such loans.\nNew mortgage lending rules may increase the risk associated with our residential mortgage lending business. Over the course of the past several years, the CFPB has issues numerous rules regarding mortgage lending, notably a rule requiring all home mortgage lenders to determine a borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan. Loans with certain terms and conditions and that otherwise meet the definition of a \u201cqualitied mortgage\u201d may be protected from liability. While we believe that our current loan policy is consistent with the guidance, making the majority of our loans \u201cqualified mortgages,\u201d there is the possibility that in the event of a dispute, regulators or courts may come to a different conclusion and the Bank may be exposed to unexpected liability. Additional rules regarding disclosures and closing documents (the so-called \u201cTILA/RESPA\u201d rules\u201d) took effect in 2015 and created additional compliance and liability risks.\nSince the Truth in Lending Act-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (\u201cTRID\u201d) rule became effective for loans originated on or after October 3, 2015, there has been uncertainty in the residential mortgage lending industry regarding whether the Truth in Lending Act\u2019s (\u201cTILA\u201d) liability rules or RESPA\u2019s liability rules would govern TRID violations. The TRID rule required extensive modifications to the process of closing a federally regulated residential mortgage loan and the systems that support that process among lenders, real estate agents, title insurance agents and attorneys that close residential mortgage loans, and others. Under TILA, there is a private right of action. Under RESPA, there is not. The Mortgage Bankers Association has noted increased secondary market rejection of mortgages which may contain technical TRID violations. The CFPB issued guidance in the form of a December 29, 2015 letter to the Mortgage Bankers Association clarifying that TILA provisions are determinative of TRID liability. Although the CFPB guidance provides\nIndex\nsome indication of the CFPB\u2019s intentions for enforcement and interpretation of the TRID rule, the TRID enforcement posture of other mortgage industry participants such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and federal banking regulators like the FDIC is not yet apparent. Management\u2019s assessment and management of TRID compliance risk will evolve as the residential mortgage lending industry gains experience with loan closings, loan purchases and examinations. The TRID rule, including the cost of compliance and the ultimate impact on the mortgage industry, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover probable losses. We have established an allowance for loan losses which we believe is adequate to offset probable losses on our existing loans. There can be no assurance that any future declines in real estate market conditions, general economic conditions or changes in regulatory policies will not require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations and, possibly, our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to achieve or successfully manage continued growth. The Company has pursued and continues to pursue a strategy of organic growth. The success of the Company's growth strategy will depend largely upon its ability to manage its credit risk and control its costs while providing competitive products and services. This growth strategy may present special risks, such as the risk that the Company will not efficiently handle growth with its present operations, the risk of dilution of book value and earnings per share as a result of an acquisition, the risk that earnings will be adversely affected by the start-up costs associated with establishing new products and services, the risk that the Company will not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel needed for expanded operations, and the risk that its internal monitoring and control systems may prove inadequate.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s shareholders. In addition to state and federal laws and regulations governing changes in control of insured depository institutions or holding companies, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain certain provisions that may delay or make more difficult an acquisition of control of the Company. Delaware law presently requires a two-thirds majority vote of the outstanding shares to approve a merger or other consolidation. Further, the Company has 500,000 shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share, which may be issued in the future with such rights, privileges and preferences as are determined by the Board of Directors of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock trading volume may not provide adequate liquidity for investors. The Company\u2019s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \"WAYN\", but trading volume has not been significant. There can be no assurance given as to the liquidity of the market for the common stock or the price at which any sales may occur, which price will depend upon, among other things, the number of holders thereof, the interest of securities dealers in maintaining a market in the common stock and other factors beyond the control of the Company.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock can be volatile, which may make it more difficult to resell Company common stock at a desired time and price. The market price for the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly and yearly operating results, general trends in the banking industry and other factors. In addition, the stock market can experience price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of affected companies. These broad fluctuations may make it more difficult for a shareholder to resell the Company common stock when a shareholder wants to and at prices a shareholder finds attractive or at all.\nThe loss of key personnel may adversely impact our financial stability. The Company's success depends to a great extent on its senior management. The loss of their individual services could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial stability and its operations. In addition, the Company's future performance depends on its ability to attract and retain key personnel and skilled employees,\nIndex\nparticularly at the senior management level. The Company's financial stability and its operations could be adversely affected if, for any reason, one or more key executive officers ceased to be active in the Company's management.\nWe may not be able to successfully compete with others for business. Banking institutions operate in a highly competitive environment. The Company competes with other commercial banks, credit unions, savings institutions, finance companies, mortgage companies, mutual funds, and other financial institutions, many of which have substantially greater financial resources than the Company. Certain of these competitors offer products and services that are not offered by the Company and certain competitors are not subject to the same extensive laws and regulations as the Company. Additionally, consolidation of the financial services industry in Ohio and in the Midwest in recent years has increased the level of competition. Recent and proposed regulatory changes may further intensify competition in the Company's market area.\nOur ability to pay dividends may be limited. The Company is a savings and loan holding company, which is substantially dependent on the profitability of its subsidiary and the upstream payment of dividends from the Bank to the Company. Under state and federal banking law, the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company is subject to capital adequacy requirements. The inability of the Bank to generate profits and pay such dividends to the Company, or regulator restrictions on the payment of such dividends to the Company even if Bank profits are earned, would have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nGoodwill Impairment may adversely impact our results of operations. Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations. Under current accounting standards, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indeterminate lives are no longer amortized but, instead, are evaluated for impairment periodically or when impairment indicators are present. Evaluation of goodwill and such other intangible assets could result in circumstances where the applicable intangible asset is deemed to be impaired for accounting purposes. Under such circumstances, the intangible asset\u2019s impairment would be reflected as a charge to earnings in the period during which such impairment is identified. Management evaluated the goodwill using an analysis of required measures of value, including the current stock price as an indicator of minority interest value, change of control multiples as a measure of controlling interest value and discounted cash flow analysis as a measure of going concern value and applied a weighting based on appraisal standards to arrive at a valuation conclusion that indicated no impairment at December 31, 2015.\nMaterial breaches in the security of bank systems may have a significant effect on the Company business. Increasing attention is being paid by the media, regulators and legislators to all matters relating to \u201ccybersecurity,\u201d and the incidence of \u201ccyber attacks\u201d is increasing in both frequency and scope against entities of all types. The Company\u2019s subsidiary bank collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by the Bank and third party service providers. The Bank has security, backup and recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan to ensure the Bank\u2019s systems will not be inoperable. The Company\u2019s subsidiary bank also has security to prevent unauthorized access to the system. In addition, the Bank requires third party service providers to maintain similar controls. However, the Bank cannot be certain that these measures will be successful. A security breach in the system and loss of confidential information could result in losing customers\u2019 confidence and thus the loss of their business as well as additional significant costs for privacy monitoring activities.\nThe Bank\u2019s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process the Bank\u2019s transaction volumes poses the risk that technical system flaws or employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. The Company\u2019s subsidiary bank may also be subject to disruptions of the operating system arising from events that are beyond the Bank\u2019s control (for\nIndex\nexample, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages). The Bank is further exposed to the risk that the third party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors as the Bank). These disruptions may interfere with service to the Bank\u2019s customers and result in a financial loss or liability.", "PERMNO": 79313, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "WAYN"}
