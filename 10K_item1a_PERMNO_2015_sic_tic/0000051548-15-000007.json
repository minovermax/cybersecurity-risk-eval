RISK FACTORS\nForward-looking statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements. The documents incorporated into this report by reference may also contain forward-looking statements. You can identify a forward-looking statement by our use of the words \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cprojection,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements include our statements regarding the timing of future events, our anticipated future operations and our anticipated future financial position and cash requirements.\nWe believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable. We do not know whether our expectations will ultimately prove correct.\nIn the section that follows below, in cautionary statements made elsewhere in this report, and in other filings we have made with the SEC, we list the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of the risk factors described below and other factors set forth in or incorporated by reference in this report.\nThese factors and cautionary statements apply to all future forward-looking statements we make. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Do not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements or project any future results based on such statements or on present or prior earnings levels.\nAdditional information concerning these or other factors, which could cause the actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in our other SEC filings. Copies of those filings are available from us and/or the SEC.\nAdverse changes in our relationships with NASCAR and other motorsports sanctioning bodies, or their present sanctioning practices, could limit our future success\nOur success has been, and is expected to remain, dependent on maintaining good working relationships with the organizations that sanction the races we promote at our facilities, particularly NASCAR. NASCAR-sanctioned races conducted at our wholly owned motorsports entertainment facilities accounted for approximately 86.3 percent of our total revenues in fiscal 2014. Each NASCAR sanctioning agreement (and the accompanying media rights fees revenue) is awarded on an annual basis and NASCAR is not required to continue to enter into, renew or extend sanctioning agreements with us to conduct any event. Any adverse change in the present sanctioning practices, or the present economic model, could adversely impact our operations and revenue. Moreover, although our general growth strategy includes the possible development and/or acquisition of additional motorsports entertainment facilities, we have no assurance that any sanctioning body, including NASCAR, will enter into sanctioning agreements with us to conduct races at any newly developed or acquired motorsports entertainment facilities. Failure to obtain a sanctioning agreement for a major NASCAR event could negatively affect us. Similarly, although NASCAR has in the past approved our requests for realignment of sanctioned events, NASCAR is not obligated to modify its race schedules to allow us to schedule our races more efficiently or profitably.\nChanges to media rights revenues could adversely affect us\nDomestic broadcast and ancillary media rights fees revenues derived from NASCAR's three national touring series -- the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Xfinity Series, and Camping World Truck Series -- are an important component of our revenue and earnings stream and any adverse changes to such rights fees revenues could adversely impact our results.\nAny material changes in the media industry that could lead to differences in historical practices or decreases in the term and/or financial value of future broadcast agreements could have a material adverse affect on our revenues and financial results.\nChanges, declines and delays in consumer and corporate spending as well as illiquid credit markets could adversely affect us\nOur financial results depend significantly upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer and corporate spending, including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as:\n\u2022\nEmployment;\n\u2022\nBusiness conditions;\n\u2022\nInterest rates; and\n\u2022\nTaxation rates.\nThese factors can impact both attendance at our events and advertising and marketing dollars available from the motorsports industry\u2019s principal sponsors and potential sponsors. Economic and other lifestyle conditions such as illiquid consumer and business credit markets adversely affect consumer and corporate spending thereby impacting our revenue, profitability and financial results. Further, changes in consumer behavior such as deferred purchasing decisions and decreased spending budgets adversely impact our cash flow visibility and revenues. The significant economic deterioration that began in fiscal 2008, for example, has impacted these areas of our business and our revenues and financial results.\nUnavailability of credit on favorable terms can adversely impact our growth, development and capital spending plans. General economic conditions were significantly and negatively impacted by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and could be similarly affected by any future attacks, by a terrorist attack at any mass gathering or fear of such attacks, or by other acts or prospects of war. Any future attacks or wars or related threats could also increase our expenses related to insurance, security or other related matters. A weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence created by such a climate, could adversely affect our financial results. Finally, our financial results could also be adversely impacted by a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis.\nDelay, postponement or cancellation of major motorsports events because of weather or other factors could adversely affect us\nWe promote outdoor motorsports entertainment events. Weather conditions affect sales of, among other things, tickets, food, drinks and merchandise at these events. Poor weather conditions prior to an event, or even the forecast of poor weather conditions, could have a negative impact on us, particularly for walk-up ticket sales to events which are not sold out in advance, as well as renewals for the following year. If an event scheduled for one of our facilities is delayed or postponed because of weather or other reasons such as, for example, the general postponement of all major sporting events in the United States following the September 11, 2001 terrorism attacks, we could incur increased expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event, as well as possible decreased revenues from tickets, food, drinks and merchandise at the rescheduled event. If such an event is canceled, we would incur the expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event as well as losing the revenues, including any live broadcast revenues, associated with the event.\nIf a canceled event is part of the NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity or Camping World Truck series, in the year of cancellation we could experience a reduction in the amount of money we expect to receive from television revenues for all of our NASCAR-sanctioned events in the series that experienced the cancellation. This would occur if, as a result of the cancellation, and without regard to whether the canceled event was scheduled for one of our facilities, NASCAR experienced a reduction in television revenues greater than the amount scheduled to be paid to the promoter of the canceled event.\nFrance Family Group control of NASCAR creates conflicts of interest\nMembers of the France Family Group own and control NASCAR. James C. France, our Chairman of the Board, and Lesa France Kennedy, our Vice Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer, are both members of the France Family Group in addition to holding positions with NASCAR. Each of them, as well as our general counsel, spends part of his or her time on NASCAR\u2019s business. Because of these relationships, even though all related party transactions are approved by our Audit Committee, certain potential conflicts of interest between us and NASCAR exist with respect to, among other things:\n\u2022\nThe terms of any sanctioning agreements that may be awarded to us by NASCAR;\n\u2022\nThe amount of time the employees mentioned above and certain of our other employees devote to NASCAR\u2019s affairs; and\n\u2022\nThe amounts charged or paid to NASCAR for office rental, transportation costs, shared executives, administrative expenses and similar items.\nFrance Family Group members, together, beneficially own approximately 39.0 percent of our capital stock and control over 72.0 percent of the combined voting power of both classes of our common stock. Historically members of the France Family Group have voted their shares of common stock in the same manner. Accordingly, they can (without the approval of our other shareholders) elect our entire Board of Directors and determine the outcome of various matters submitted to shareholders for approval, including fundamental corporate transactions and have done so in the past. If holders of class B common stock other than the France Family Group elect to convert their beneficially owned shares of class B common stock into shares of class A common stock and members of the France Family Group do not convert their shares, the relative voting power of the France Family Group will increase. Voting control by the France Family Group may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us, including transactions in which the holders of class A common stock might receive a premium for their shares over prevailing market prices.\nOur success depends on the availability and performance of key personnel\nOur continued success depends upon the availability and performance of our senior management team, which possesses unique and extensive industry knowledge and experience. Our inability to retain and attract key employees in the future, could have a negative effect on our operations and business plans.\nOur capital allocation plan may not achieve anticipated results\nEnhancing the live event experience for our guests by investing in our major motorsports facilities is a critical strategy for our growth, and our Board of Directors has endorsed a capital allocation plan for fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2017 related to this strategy, which includes DAYTONA Rising. This plan involves significant challenges and risks including that the projects do not advance our business strategy or that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these projects, such as increased revenue, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized. These events could harm our operating results or financial condition. Further, these projects may not be completed on time, which could result in a negative financial impact.\nFuture impairment or loss on disposal of goodwill and other intangible assets or long-lived assets by us or our equity investments and joint ventures could adversely affect our financial results\nOur consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets and long-lived assets which could be subject to impairment or loss on retirement. During the fiscal years ended November 30, 2012, 2013 and 2014 we recorded before-tax charges as losses on retirements of long-lived assets primarily attributable to the removal of certain other long-lived assets located at our motorsports facilities totaling approximately $11.1 million, $16.6 million and $10.1 million, respectively.\nAs of November 30, 2014, goodwill and other intangible assets and property and equipment accounts for approximately $1.7 billion, or 80.8 percent of our total assets. We account for our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 350, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, and for our long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment.\u201d Both ASC 350 and 360 require testing goodwill and other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook. While we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future, our analyses are subjective and are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the assumptions are made. Actual results could differ materially from these assumptions. Our judgments with regard to our future business prospects could impact whether or not an impairment is deemed to have occurred, as well as the timing of the recognition of such an impairment charge. If future testing for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets or long-lived assets results in a reduction in their carrying value, we will be required to take the amount of the reduction in such goodwill and other intangible assets or long-lived assets as a non-cash charge against operating income, which would also reduce shareholders\u2019 equity.\nIn addition, our growth strategy includes investing in certain joint venture opportunities. In these equity investments we exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee. These equity investments add an additional element of risk where they may not advance our business strategy or that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these equity investments, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized. These events could harm our operating results or financial condition. Our equity investments total approximately $122.6 million at November 30, 2014.\nPersonal injuries to spectators and participants could adversely affect financial results\nMotorsports can be dangerous to participants and spectators. We maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that we believe should generally be sufficient to protect us from a large financial loss due to liability for personal injuries sustained by persons on our property in the ordinary course of our business. There can be no assurance, however, that the insurance will be adequate or available at all times and in all circumstances. Our financial condition and results of operations could be affected negatively to the extent claims and expenses in connection with these injuries are greater than insurance recoveries or if insurance coverage for these exposures becomes unavailable or prohibitively expensive.\nIn addition, sanctioning bodies could impose more stringent rules and regulations for safety, security and operational activities. Such regulations include, for example, the improvements and additions of retaining walls at our facilities, which have increased our capital expenditures, and increased security procedures, which have increased our operational expenses.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment\nAs an entertainment company, our racing events face competition from other spectator-oriented sporting events and other leisure, entertainment and recreational activities, including professional football, basketball, hockey and baseball. As a result, our revenues are affected by the general popularity of motorsports, the availability of alternative forms of recreation and changing consumer preferences and habits, including how consumers consume entertainment. Our racing events also compete with other racing events sanctioned by various racing bodies such as NASCAR, USAC, NHRA, SCCA, IMSA, ARCA and others. Many sports and entertainment businesses have resources that exceed ours.\nWe are subject to changing governmental regulations and legal standards that could increase our expenses\nWe believe that our operations are in material compliance with all applicable federal, state and local environmental, land use and other laws and regulations.\nIf it is determined that damage to persons or property or contamination of the environment has been caused or exacerbated by the operation or conduct of our business or by pollutants, substances, contaminants or wastes used, generated or disposed of by us, or if pollutants, substances, contaminants or wastes are found on property currently or previously owned or operated by us, we may be held liable for such damage and may be required to pay the cost of investigation and/or remediation of such contamination or any related damage. The amount of such liability as to which we are self-insured could be material.\nState and local laws relating to the protection of the environment also can include noise abatement laws that may be applicable to our racing events.\nOur existing facilities continue to be used in situations where the standards for new facilities to comply with certain laws and regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, are constantly evolving. Changes in the provisions or application of federal, state or local environmental, land use or other laws, regulations or requirements to our facilities or operations, or the discovery of previously unknown conditions, also could require us to make additional material expenditures to remediate or attain compliance.\nRegulations governing the use and development of real estate may prevent us from acquiring or developing prime locations for motorsports entertainment facilities, substantially delay or complicate the process of improving existing facilities, and/or increase the costs of any of such activities.\nIf we do not maintain the security of customer-related information, we could damage our reputation with customers, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store certain personal information including but not limited to name, address and payment account information from individuals, such as our customers, employees and business partners. We also process customer payment card transactions. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential, personal and payment account information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. We limit the amount of payment information by using \u201ctokens\u201d which is an industry best practice that does not require the credit card number to be stored. Significant resources are dedicated both internally and with external experts to help us manage information security, network security, data encryption, and other security practices to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error or malfeasance, or other unanticipated situations. Such a compromise of our security systems that results in personal or payment network information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, the credit card brands (such as VISA, MasterCard and American Express) and others. Such a compromise could also adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us, the imposition of penalties, restrictions or other requirements by regulatory\nbodies or the credit card brands. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our sales operations. While we maintain insurance against this risk, not all losses would be covered by such insurance.\nOur quarterly results are subject to seasonality and variability\nWe derive most of our income from a limited number of NASCAR-sanctioned races. As a result, our business has been, and is expected to remain, highly seasonal based on the timing of major racing events. Future schedule changes as determined by NASCAR or other sanctioning bodies, as well as the acquisition of additional, or divestiture of existing, motorsports entertainment facilities could impact the timing of our major events in comparison to prior or future periods.", "PERMNO": 84226, "SIC": 7948, "TIC": "ISCA"}
