RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors describe various risks that may affect our business, financial condition, and operations. References to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section refer to Core Molding Technologies and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified or unless the context otherwise requires.\nOur business has concentration risks associated with significant customers.\nSales to four customers constituted approximately 87% of our 2014 total sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales for this period. The loss of any significant portion of sales to any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAccounts receivable balances with four customers accounted for 90% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2014. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition and maintains reserves for potential bad debt losses. If the financial conditions of any of these customers were to deteriorate impacting their ability to pay their receivables to our Company our reserves may not be adequate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are continuing to engage in efforts intended to strengthen and expand our relations with significant customers, as well as provide support for our entire customer base. We have supported our position with customers through direct and active contact through our sales, quality, engineering, and operational personnel. We cannot make any assurances that we will maintain or improve our customer relationships, whether these customers will continue to do business with us as they have in the past or whether we will be able to supply these customers or any of our other customers at current levels.\nOur business is affected by the cyclical nature of the industries and markets that we serve.\nThe North American heavy and medium-duty truck industries are highly cyclical. In 2014, approximately 83% of product sales were in these industries. These industries and markets fluctuate in response to factors that are beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, federal and state regulations (including engine emissions regulations, tariffs, import regulations, and other taxes), consumer spending, fuel costs, and our customers' inventory levels and production rates. Our manufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component. Accordingly, during periods of changing demands, the profitability of our operations may change proportionately more than revenues from operations. In addition, our operations are typically seasonal as a result of regular customer maintenance shutdowns, which typically vary from year to year based on production demands and occur in the third and fourth quarter of each calendar year. This seasonality may result in decreased net sales and profitability during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of each calendar year. Weakness in overall economic conditions or in the markets that we serve, or significant reductions by our customers in their inventory levels or future production rates, could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nPrice increases in raw materials and availability of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe purchase resins and fiberglass for use in production as well as hardware and other components for product assembly. The prices for purchased materials are affected by the prices of material feed stocks such as crude oil, natural gas, and downstream components, as well as processing capacity versus demand. We attempt to reduce our exposure to increases by working with suppliers, evaluating new suppliers, improving material efficiencies, and when necessary through sales price adjustments to customers. If we are unsuccessful in developing ways to mitigate these raw material increases we may not be able to improve productivity or realize our ongoing cost reduction programs sufficiently to help offset the impact of these increased raw material costs. As a result, higher raw material costs could result in declining margins and operating results.\nCost reduction and quality improvement initiatives by original equipment manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are primarily a components supplier to the heavy and medium-duty truck industries, which are characterized by a small number of original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) that are able to exert considerable pressure on components suppliers to reduce costs, improve quality, and provide additional design and engineering capabilities. Given the fragmented nature of the industry, OEMs continue to demand and receive price reductions and measurable increases in quality through their use of competitive selection processes, rating programs, and various other arrangements. We may be unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions. OEMs may also seek to save costs by relocating production to countries with lower cost structures, which could in turn lead them to purchase components from suppliers with lower production costs that are\ngeographically closer to their new production facilities. These decisions by OEMs could require us to shift production between our plants so that we are more competitive. Moving production lines between our plants could result in significant costs required for transfer expenses and capital investment. Additionally, OEMs have generally required component suppliers to provide more design engineering input at earlier stages of the product development process, the costs of which have, in some cases, been absorbed by the suppliers. To the extent that the Company does not meet the quality standards or demands of quality improvement initiatives sought by OEMs, or does not match the quality of suppliers of comparable products, OEMs may choose to purchase from these alternative suppliers, and as a result the Company may lose existing or new business with OEMs. Future price reductions, increased quality standards, and additional engineering capabilities required by OEMs may reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, recalls or warranty claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nAs a components supplier to OEMs, we face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products malfunction and result in personal injury or death. Product liability claims could result in significant losses as a result of expenses incurred in defending claims or the award of damages. In addition, we may be required to participate in recalls involving components sold by us if any prove to be defective, or we may voluntarily initiate a recall or make payments related to such claims in order to maintain positive customer relationships. While we do maintain product liability insurance, it may not be sufficient to cover all product liability claims, and as a result, any product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, we warrant the quality of our products under limited warranties, and as such, we are subject to risk of warranty claims in the event that our products do not conform to our customers\u2019 specifications. Such warranty claims may result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with a number of other manufacturers that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of capability, product quality, cost, and delivery. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources, research and development facilities, design engineering, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities.\nWe may be subject to additional shipping expense or late fees if we are not able to meet our customers' on-time demand for our products.\nWe must continue to meet our customers' demand for on-time delivery of our products. Factors that could result in our inability to meet customer demands include a failure by one or more of our suppliers to supply us with the raw materials and other resources that we need to operate our business effectively, poor management of our Company or one or more of its plants and an unforeseen spike in demand for our products which would create capacity constraints, among other factors. If this occurs, we may be required to incur additional shipping expenses to ensure on-time delivery or otherwise be required to pay late fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel our business could be harmed.\nOur success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of our key personnel. Their skills, experience, and industry contacts significantly benefit us. The inability to retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our future success will also depend in part upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.\nWork stoppages or other labor issues at our facilities or at our customers' facilities could adversely affect our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, unions at our Columbus, Ohio and Matamoros, Mexico facilities represented approximately 67% of our entire workforce. As a result, we are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor-relations matters. The current Columbus, Ohio and Matamoros, Mexico union contracts extend through August 7, 2016 and January 16, 2017, respectively. Any prolonged work stoppage or strike at either our Columbus, Ohio or Matamoros, Mexico unionized facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Any failure by us to reach a new agreement upon expiration of such union contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn addition, if any of our customers or suppliers experiences a material work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products or the supplier may interrupt supply of our necessary production components. This could cause us to shut down\nproduction facilities relating to these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChanges in the legal, regulatory and social responses to climate change, including any possible effect on energy prices, could adversely affect our business and reduce our profitability.\nIt is possible that various proposed legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate changes, such as cap-and-trade systems, increased limits on emissions of greenhouse gases and fuel efficiency standards, or other measures, could in the future have a material impact on us, our customers, or the markets we serve, thereby resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation. For example, customers in the transportation (automotive and truck) industry could be required to incur greater costs in order to comply with such initiatives, which could have an adverse impact on their profitability or viability. This could in turn lead to further changes in the structure of the transportation industry that could reduce demand for our products. We are also reliant on energy to manufacture our products, with our operating costs being subject to increase if energy costs rise. During periods of higher energy costs we may not be able to recover our operating cost increases through production efficiencies and price increases. While we may hedge our exposure to higher prices via future energy purchase contracts, increases in energy prices for any reason (including as a result of new initiatives related to climate change) will increase our operating costs and likely reduce our profitability.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing equipment and infrastructure.\nWe convert raw materials into molded products through a manufacturing process at production facilities in Columbus, Ohio; Gaffney, South Carolina; Batavia, Ohio; and Matamoros, Mexico. While we maintain insurance covering our manufacturing and production facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of our facilities due to accident, fire, explosion, or natural disaster, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nUnexpected failures of our equipment and machinery may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs, as well as injuries to our employees. Any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to offset the lost revenues or increased costs that we may experience during a disruption of our operations. Because we supply our products to OEMs, a temporary or long-term business disruption could result in a permanent loss of customers. If this were to occur, our future sales levels and therefore our profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with new business awards. In order to recognize profit from new business, we must accurately estimate product costs as part of the quoting process and implement effective and efficient manufacturing processes.\nThe success of our business relies on our ability to produce products which meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers. Our ability to recognize profit is largely dependent upon accurately identifying the costs associated with the manufacture of our products, and executing the manufacturing process in a cost effective manner. There can be no assurance that all costs will be accurately identified during the Company's quoting process, or that the expected level of manufacturing efficiency will be achieved, and as a result we may not realize the anticipated operating results related to new business awards.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect against the potential hazards incident to our business.\nWe maintain property, business interruption, stop loss for healthcare and workers' compensation, director and officer, product liability, and casualty insurance coverage, but such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims, including losses resulting from war risks, terrorist acts, or product liability claims relating to products we manufacture. Consistent with market conditions in the insurance industry, premiums and deductibles for some of our insurance policies have been increasing and may continue to increase in the future. In some instances, some types of insurance may become available only for reduced amounts of coverage, if at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that our insurers would not challenge coverage for certain claims. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured or that our insurers disputed, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nWe have made acquisitions and may make acquisitions in the future. We may not realize the operating results that we anticipate from these acquisitions or from acquisitions we may make in the future, and we may experience difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses or may inherit significant liabilities related to such businesses.\nWe explore opportunities to acquire businesses that we believe are related to our core competencies from time to time, some of which may be material to us. We expect such acquisitions will produce operating results consistent with our other operations, however, we cannot provide assurance that this assumption will prove correct with respect to any acquisition.\nAny acquisitions may present significant challenges for our management due to the increased time and resources required to properly integrate management, employees, information systems, accounting controls, personnel, and administrative functions of the acquired business with those of ours and to manage the combined company on a going forward basis. The diversion of management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of these businesses could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and liquidity, and the benefits we anticipate may never materialize.\nExpected future sales from business awards may not materialize. We may not realize the sales or operating results that we anticipate from new business awards, and we may experience difficulties in meeting the production demands of new business awards.\nWe will continue to pursue, and may be awarded, new business from existing or new customers. The Company may make capital investments, which may be material to the Company, in order to meet the expected production requirements of existing or new customers related to these business awards, and to support the potential production demands which may result from continued sales growth. The anticipated impact on the Company's sales and operating results related to these business awards, for various reasons, may not materialize. Any delays or production difficulties encountered in connection with these business awards, and any change in customer demand, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and liquidity, and the benefits we anticipate may never materialize.\nIf we are unable to meet future capital requirements, our business may be adversely affected.\nAs we grow our business, we may have to incur significant capital expenditures. We may make capital investments to, among other things, build new or upgrade our facilities, purchase leased facilities and equipment, and enhance our production processes. We cannot assure you that we will have, or be able to obtain, adequate funds to make all necessary capital expenditures when required, or that the amount of future capital expenditures will not be materially in excess of our anticipated or current expenditures. If we are unable to make necessary capital expenditures we may not have the capability to support our customer demands, which, in turn could reduce our sales and profitability and impair our ability to satisfy our customers' expectations. In addition, even if we are able to invest sufficient resources, these investments may not generate net sales that exceed our expenses, generate any net sales at all, or result in any commercially acceptable products.\nOur failure to comply with our debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur debt agreements contain certain covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement. If a default were to occur, we would likely seek a waiver of that default, attempt to reset the covenant, or refinance the instrument and accompanying obligations. If we were unable to obtain this relief, the default could result in the acceleration of the total due related to that debt obligation. If a default were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. Any of these events, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe may not achieve expected efficiencies related to the proximity of our customers' production facilities to our manufacturing facilities, or with respect to existing or future production relocation plans.\nOur facilities are located in close proximity to our customers in order to minimize both our customer's and our own costs. If any of our customers were to move or if nearby facilities are closed, that may impact our ability to remain competitive. Additionally, our competitors could build a facility that is closer to our customers' facilities which may provide them with a geographic advantage. Any of these events might require us to move closer to our customers, build new facilities or shift production between our current facilities to meet our customers' needs, resulting in additional cost and expense.\nOur products may be rendered obsolete or less attractive if there are changes in technology, regulatory requirements, or competitive processes.\nChanges in technology, regulatory requirements, and competitive processes may render certain products obsolete or less attractive. Future chemical regulations may restrict our ability to manufacture products, cause us to incur substantial expenditures to comply with them, and subject us to liability for adverse environmental or health effects linked to the manufacture of our products. Failure to comply with future regulations may subject us to penalties or other enforcement actions. Our ability to anticipate changes in these areas will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. If we are unable to identify or compensate for any one of these changes it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nOur stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors. Factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results, our relatively small public float, changes in securities analysts' estimates of our future earnings, and the loss of major customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors, and other factors, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Our common stock also has a low average daily trading volume, which limits a person's ability to quickly accumulate or quickly divest themselves of large blocks of our stock. In addition, a low average trading volume can lead to significant price swings even when a relatively few number of shares are being traded.\nWe are subject to environmental, occupational health and safety rules and regulations that may require us to make substantial expenditures or expose us to financial or other obligations including substantial damages, penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions and remediation costs that could adversely affect our results.\nOur operations, facilities, and personnel are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, health and safety, the investigation and remediation of contamination, and the protection of the environment and natural resources. It is difficult to predict the future interpretations and developments of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or their impact on our future results and cash flows. Continued compliance could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. In addition, we may be exposed to obligations or involved from time to time in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental, health and safety or other regulatory matters, and may incur financial and other obligations relating to such matters.\nAlthough we do not presently anticipate terminating any senior management employees, certain senior management employees have entered into potentially costly severance arrangements with us if terminated after a change in control.\nWe have entered into executive severance agreements with executive officers that provide for significant severance payments in the event such employee's employment with us is terminated within two years of a change in control (as defined in the severance agreement) either by the employee for good reason (as defined in the severance agreement) or by us for any reason other than cause (as defined in the severance agreement), or for death, or disability. A change in control under these agreements includes any transaction or series of related transactions as a result of which less than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of our voting stock immediately prior to such transaction; any person has become the beneficial owner of securities representing 50% or more of our voting stock; we file a report or proxy statement with the SEC that a change in control of the Company has occurred; or within any two year period, the directors at the beginning of the period cease to constitute at least a majority thereof. These agreements would make it costly for us to terminate certain of our senior management employees and such costs may also discourage potential acquisition proposals, which may negatively affect our stock price.\nOur foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\nWe operate a manufacturing facility in Matamoros, Mexico and, as a result, a significant portion of our business and operations are subject to the risk of changes in economic conditions, tax systems, consumer preferences, social conditions, safety and security conditions and political conditions inherent in Mexico, including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment, as well as changes in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment. In addition, our results of operations and the value of certain foreign assets and liabilities are affected by fluctuations in Mexican currency exchange rates, which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings. Having transferred certain of our production lines to Matamoros, Mexico in recent years, our operations in Mexico have increased materially, and accordingly our exposure to the aforementioned risks relating to foreign operations has increased. There can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nEconomic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, financial markets experienced turmoil and uncertainty. Disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to borrow money from our existing lenders were to be impaired. Disruptions in the financial markets may also have a material adverse impact on the availability and cost of credit in the future. Our ability to pay our debt or refinance our obligations will depend on our future performance, which could be affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions. Disruptions in the financial markets may also have an adverse effect on the U.S. and world economies, which would have a negative impact on demand for our products. In addition, tightening of credit markets may have an adverse impact on our customers' ability to finance the sale of new trucks or our suppliers' ability to provide us with raw materials, either of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 84387, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "CMT"}
