Risk Factors\nThe concentration of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio in loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located on Long Island and the New York City boroughs could materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations if general economic conditions or real estate values in this area decline.\nUnlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island, and in the New York City boroughs. The local economic conditions on Long Island and in New York City have a significant impact on the\nPage -7-\nvolume of loan originations and the quality of loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of collateral securing these loans. A considerable decline in the general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond the Bank\u2019s control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s earnings.\nIf bank regulators impose limitations on the Bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending activities, earnings could be adversely affected.\nIn 2006, the FDIC, the OCC and the FRB (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d (the \u201cCRE Guidance\u201d). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. The Bank\u2019s level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 312% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2016. Including owner-occupied commercial real estate, the ratio of commercial real estate loans to total risk-based capital ratio would be 425% at December 31, 2016.\nIn December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the \u201c2015 Statement\u201d). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the OCC were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans the Bank can hold in its portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans held, the Bank\u2019s earnings would be adversely affected.\nChanges in interest rates could affect the Bank\u2019s profitability.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to earn a profit, like most financial institutions, depends primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that the Bank earns on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest expense that the Bank pays on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The Bank\u2019s profitability depends on its ability to manage its assets and liabilities during periods of changing market interest rates.\nIn a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on the Bank\u2019s assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on its liabilities. In an increasing interest rate environment, the Bank\u2019s cost of funds is expected to increase more rapidly than interest earned on its loan and investment portfolio as its primary source of funds is deposits with generally shorter maturities than those on its loans and investments. This makes the balance sheet more liability sensitive in the short term.\nA sustained decrease in market interest rates could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s earnings. When interest rates decline, borrowers tend to refinance higher-rate, fixed-rate loans at lower rates. Under those circumstances, the Bank would not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on those prepaid loans or in investment securities. In addition, the majority of the Bank\u2019s loans are at variable interest rates, which would adjust to lower rates.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the fair value of the securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, the securities portfolio totaled $1.08 billion.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits effective July 21, 2011, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this change to existing law could increase the Bank\u2019s interest expense.\nStrong competition within the Bank\u2019s market area may limit its growth and profitability.\nThe Bank\u2019s primary market area is located in Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and the New York City boroughs. Competition in the banking and financial services industry remains intense. The profitability of the Bank depends on the continued ability to successfully compete. The Bank competes with commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms. Many of the Bank\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Bank and may offer certain services that the Bank does not provide. In addition, competitors may offer deposits at higher rates and loans with lower fixed rates, more attractive terms and less stringent credit structures than the Bank has been willing to offer.\nPage -8-\nAcquisitions involve integrations and other risks.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges including: the Bank\u2019s ability to integrate the branches and operations acquired, and the associated internal controls and regulatory functions, into the Bank\u2019s current operations; the Bank\u2019s ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by the Bank\u2019s new customers in the acquired branches and to successfully retain and manage the loans acquired; and the Bank\u2019s ability to attract new deposits and to generate new interest-earning assets in geographic areas not previously served. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the operation of acquired branches would not adversely affect the Bank\u2019s existing profitability; that the Bank would be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the Bank\u2019s existing banking business; that the Bank would be able to compete effectively in the market areas served by acquired branches; or that the Bank would be able to manage any growth resulting from the transaction effectively. The Bank faces the additional risk that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or within the time period expected. Finally, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values and therefore, may result in dilution of the Company\u2019s book and tangible book value per share.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends on the success and growth of The Bridgehampton National Bank.\nThe Company\u2019s primary business activity for the foreseeable future will be to act as the holding company of the Bank. Therefore, the Company\u2019s future profitability will depend on the success and growth of this subsidiary. The continued and successful implementation of the Company\u2019s growth strategy will require, among other things that the Bank increases its market share by attracting new customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in the Bank\u2019s market area. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to successfully grow will depend on several factors, including favorable market conditions, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in the Bank\u2019s market area, and the Bank\u2019s ability to maintain high asset quality. While the Company believes it has the management resources, market opportunities and internal systems in place to obtain and successfully manage future growth, growth opportunities may not be available and the Company may not be successful in continuing its growth strategy. In addition, continued growth requires that the Company incurs additional expenses, including salaries, data processing and occupancy expense related to new branches and related support staff. Many of these increased expenses are considered fixed expenses. Unless the Company can successfully continue its growth, its results of operations could be negatively affected by these increased costs.\nThe loss of key personnel could impair the Company\u2019s future success.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends in part on the continued service of its executive officers, other key management, and staff, as well as its ability to continue to attract, motivate, and retain additional highly qualified employees. The loss of services of one or more of the Company\u2019s key personnel or its inability to timely recruit replacements for such personnel, or to otherwise attract, motivate, or retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment.\nThe Bank and Company are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, the FDIC, the FRB and the SEC. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the consumer rather than for the protection of shareholders. In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area as well as other areas of the Bank\u2019s operations, the Company has been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. The Company cannot be certain that the policies, procedures, and systems in place are effective and there is no assurance that in every instance the Company is in full compliance with these requirements. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by current economic and market conditions.\nAlthough economic and real estate conditions improved in 2016, the Company continues to operate in a challenging environment both nationally and locally. This poses significant risks to both the Company\u2019s business and the banking industry as a whole. Although the Company has taken, and continues to take, steps to reduce its exposure to the risks that stem from adverse changes in such conditions, it nonetheless could be impacted by them to the degree that they affect the loans the Bank originates and the securities it invests in. Specific risks include reduced loan demand from quality borrowers; increased competition for loans; increased loan loss provisions resulting from deterioration in loan quality caused by, among other things, depressed real estate values and high levels of unemployment; reduced net interest income and net interest margin caused by a sustained period of low interest rates; interest rate volatility; price competition for deposits due to liquidity concerns or otherwise; and volatile equity markets.\nPage -9-\nIncreases to the allowance for credit losses may cause the Bank\u2019s earnings to decrease.\nCustomers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Hence, the Bank may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. The Bank makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Bank relies on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If its assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance through charges to earnings would materially decrease the Bank\u2019s net income.\nBank regulators periodically review the allowance for credit losses and may require the Bank to increase its provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s results of operations and/or financial condition.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company for the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, will require that the Bank determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require the Bank to increase its allowance for loan losses, and will greatly increase the types of data the Bank would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe subordinated debentures the Company issued have rights that are senior to those of the Company\u2019s common shareholders.\nIn 2015, the Company issued $40.0 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debentures due 2025 and $40.0 million of 5.75% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debentures due 2030. Because these subordinated debentures rank senior to the Company\u2019s common stock, if the Company fails to timely make principal and interest payments on the subordinated debentures, the Company may not pay any dividends on its common stock. Further, if the Company declares bankruptcy, dissolves or liquidates, it must satisfy all of its subordinated debenture obligations before it may pay any distributions on its common stock.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act tightened capital standards, created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) and resulted in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase the Company\u2019s cost of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is significantly changing the bank regulatory structure and is impacting the largest financial institutions as well as regional banks and community banks. The federal regulatory agencies, specifically the SEC and the new CFPB, are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing regulations.\nThe major bank-related provisions under the Dodd-Frank Act pertained to: capital requirements; mortgage reform and minimum lending standards; CFPB; sale of mortgage loans (including risk retention requirements); FDIC insurance-related provisions; preemption standards for national banks; abolishment of the Office of Thrift Supervision; interchange fee for debit card transactions; regulation of derivatives/swaps; Financial Services Oversight Council; resolution authority; and corporate governance matters (e.g.; \u201csay on pay\u201d, new executive compensation disclosure and clawbacks, etc.). Given the range of topics in the Dodd-Frank Act and the voluminous regulations required to be implemented by the Dodd-Frank Act, the full impact will not be known for some time.\nCertain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act impacted banks upon enactment of the legislation. Examples of this were the permanent increase of FDIC deposit insurance limits, the FDIC assessment base calculation change and the removal of the cap for the DIF, all of which in turn affected banks' FDIC deposit insurance premiums. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act had a near-term effect on the Company. For example, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets are examined by their applicable bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakened the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.\nIt is difficult to fully assess at this time what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase the Company\u2019s operating and compliance costs and could increase interest expense.\nPage -10-\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and anticipated new capital rules are uncertain.\nIn July 2013, the OCC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the rule established a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, set the leverage ratio at a uniform 4.0% of total assets, increased the minimum tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement from 4.0% to 6.0% of risk-weighted assets and assigned a higher risk weight of 150% to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. The rule limits a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of 2.5% of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective January 1, 2015. The \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u2019 is being phased in from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer will be effective.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if the Company was unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in the Company having to lengthen the terms of funding, restructure business models, and/or increase holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying the Company\u2019s business strategy and could limit its ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back shares.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect the Company\u2019s operations and earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to the Company\u2019s business. The Company collects, processes and stores sensitive customer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by it and third party service providers. The Company has established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of the Company\u2019s systems could deter customers from using the Bank\u2019s products and services. Although the Company relies on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect the systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, the Company maintains interfaces with certain third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers encounter difficulties, or if the Company has difficulty communicating with them, the Company\u2019s ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose it to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is exposed to cyber-security risks, including denial of service, hacking, and identity theft.\nThere have been well-publicized distributed denials of service attacks on large financial services companies. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to saturate the targeted online network with excessive amounts of network traffic, resulting in slow response times, or in some cases, causing the site to be temporarily unavailable. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. The Company may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nSevere weather, acts of terrorism and other external events could impact the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business.\nIn the past, weather-related events have adversely impacted the Company\u2019s market area, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas. Such events that may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common events in the future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems and the metropolitan New York area remains a central target for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of the Company\u2019s facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While the\nPage -11-\nCompany has established and regularly tests disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws could have a negative impact on the Company.\nThe Company is subject to income tax under Federal, New York State, New York City and New Jersey State laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations could increase the Company\u2019s tax burden and such increase could have a material negative impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company may incur impairment to its goodwill.\nGoodwill arises when a business is purchased for an amount greater than the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company recognized goodwill as an asset on its balance sheet in connection with the CNB, FNBNY and HSB acquisitions. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually. Although the Company determined that goodwill was not impaired during 2016, a significant and sustained decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in its expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of goodwill. If the Company was to conclude that a future write-down of the goodwill was necessary, then it would record the appropriate charge to earnings, which could be materially adverse to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.", "PERMNO": 92716, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BDGE"}
