{"cik": "1522690", "company": "GWG Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur business involves a number of challenges and risks. In addition to the other information in this report, you should consider carefully the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Organizational Structure\nOur current inability to raise capital, recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, delays in executing our business plans, and potential negative implications of the ongoing SEC non-public, fact-finding investigation raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes an explanatory paragraph stating that these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe heavily rely on debt financing through our L Bonds to raise sufficient capital to meet our obligations. We temporarily suspended the offering of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds, commencing April 16, 2021, as a result of our delay in filing certain periodic reports with the SEC, including this 2020 Form 10-K. Our inability to meet the applicable NASDAQ listing requirements in a timely manner may result in the delisting of our common stock and our L Bonds no longer being \u201ccovered securities\u201d for federal securities law purposes, which would subject the offer and sale of L Bonds to potentially extensive state \u201cblue sky\u201d securities law requirements.\nThe potential NASDAQ delisting, in combination with significant recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, delays in executing our business plans, and any potential negative outcome from the ongoing SEC investigation discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In that regard, the audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm for the audit of our 2020 consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors would lose part or all of their investment. Future reports from our independent registered public accounting firm may also contain statements expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and our business may be harmed.\nWe have a relatively limited history of operations, a history of net losses, and our future earnings, if any, and cash flows may be volatile, resulting in uncertainty about our ability to service and repay our debt when it comes due, redeem preferred stock when requested and uncertainty about our prospects generally.\nWe are a company with a relatively limited operating history, which makes it difficult to accurately forecast our earnings and cash flows. We incurred a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $168.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. We had net income attributable to common shareholders of $70.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Net income attributable to common shareholders in 2019 includes a gain on the consolidation of Beneficient of $243.0 million. We incurred a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $136.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Our lack of a significant history and the evolving nature of the markets in which we operate make it likely that there are risks inherent to our business that are yet to be recognized by us or others, or not fully appreciated, and that could result in us suffering further losses. As a result of the foregoing, an investment in our securities necessarily involves uncertainty about the stability of our operating results, cash flows and, ultimately, our ability to service and repay our debt and our prospects generally. If we are unable to pay our debt when it becomes due, the trustee for the L Bonds or our other secured lenders may foreclose on the collateral securing such debt, which collateral may be worth less than the debt it secures, and investors in our securities could lose all or a portion of their investment. In addition, any volatility in our operating results we experience may adversely affect the market price of GWG Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nOur operations and financial results may be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak has impacted many countries around the world, including the United States. There have been numerous reports of the virus outbreak disrupting or restricting supply chains, facility closures, voluntary and mandatory quarantines, and federal, state and local governments and foreign governments requiring business to temporarily close or severely curtail commercial activity. It is also possible that the spread of the coronavirus may have direct effects on\nour operations, such as high levels of employee sickness and absences, limiting employee travel or increasing telecommuting arrangements. In addition, recent developments and reports indicate the coronavirus has coincided with heightened volatility in financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide. If the coronavirus adversely affects our business operations or leads to a significant or prolonged impact on global markets or economic growth, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. We and other financial institutions generally must resume operations promptly following any interruption. If we were to suffer a disruption or interruption and were not able to resume normal operations within a period consistent with industry standards, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material manner. In addition, depending on the nature and duration of the disruption or interruption, we might become vulnerable to fraud, additional expense or other losses, or to a loss of business and customers.\nWe may be unable to capitalize on the anticipated benefits of the Beneficient Transactions.\nWe entered into the Beneficient Transactions anticipating that such transactions would provide significant financial and strategic benefits, including, significantly increasing our common equity, significantly reducing our leverage ratio, the introduction of new opportunities to lower our cost of funds (an important driver of stockholder value), diversifying our revenue and cash flow sources resulting in more consistent earnings, and increasing GWG Holdings\u2019 public float and the liquidity in its common stock, thereby increasing GWG Holdings\u2019 common stockholder base and potentially attracting additional equity analyst coverage (both of which are important factors in maximizing share valuation). In addition, certain terms of the Beneficient Transactions may be required to be revised to satisfy the requirements of the regulatory authorities from which Beneficient is seeking approvals or authorizations. There is no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits from the Beneficient Transactions. Failure to realize these benefits will likely have a material negative impact the results of our operations, our business prospects, the ultimate success of our strategic relationship and the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nGWG Holdings\u2019 ability to control the activities of Beneficient is subject to certain rights of others set forth in the limited liability company agreement for the general partner of Ben LP and GWG Holdings has entered into the Term Sheet that provides for it to relinquish certain rights with respect to Beneficient, including GWG Holdings\u2019 ability to appoint a majority of the board of directs of the general partner of Ben LP and control the activities of Beneficient.\nBeneficient Management, the general partner of Ben LP, has an executive committee, a nominating committee and a community reinvestment committee. The board of directors of Beneficient Management has the right to appoint two members of these committees, and an entity affiliated with Brad K. Heppner, former Chairman of GWG Holdings from April 26, 2019 to June 14, 2021, has the right to appoint the other two members of these committees. The entity affiliated with Mr. Heppner also has the right to appoint the chairman of the board of each of the committees. The Beneficient Management executive committee has the right to approve certain transactions on behalf of Beneficient Management and Ben LP and its subsidiaries, including the incurrence of debt, the issuance of equity interests of Ben LP or any subsidiary of Ben LP except in connection with any trust instrument or product offered by Ben LP or its affiliates, changes to or creation of employee incentive or benefit plans of Ben LP or its subsidiaries, certain changes to management of Beneficient Management or Ben LP or its subsidiaries, approval of mergers or acquisitions of Ben LP or liens on all or substantially all of its assets, and any change in the general partner of Ben LP. These rights may have the effect of limiting the power of GWG Holdings\u2019 board of directors to exercise control over certain business activities of Beneficient. In addition, GWG Holdings has entered into the Term Sheet which, if completed, will result in, among other things, (i) GWG Holdings receiving certain proposed enhancements to its investments in Beneficient; (ii) GWG Holdings no longer having the right to appoint directors of the board of directors of Beneficient Management; and (iii) Beneficient no longer being a consolidated subsidiary of GWG Holdings. Until the definitive documentation regarding the proposed transactions is finalized and executed, each of the provisions contemplated in the Term Sheet is non-binding and is subject to change in all respects, including as a result of additional diligence, the further discharge of fiduciary duties, and the negotiation of definitive documentation. The parties have begun working on definitive documentation to implement the Term Sheet and are working to complete such definitive documentation during the fourth quarter of 2021, but there can be no assurance definitive documentation will be completed by then, or at all.\nBen LP\u2019s partnership agreement eliminates fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed to GWG Holdings under Delaware law.\nBen LP\u2019s partnership agreement eliminates the fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed by Beneficient Management under Delaware law and replaces them with the duties expressly set forth in such agreement. Ben LP\u2019s partnership agreement provides that, when the general partner is permitted or required to make a decision in its \u201cdiscretion\u201d or pursuant to a provision not subject to an express standard of \u201cgood faith,\u201d in making such decision, the general partner has no duty to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting Beneficient or any other person. If a decision under Ben LP\u2019s partnership agreement is subject to an express standard of \u201cgood faith,\u201d such decision will not constitute a breach of the\nagreement if the decision is approved by (i) a majority of the members of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the general partner of Ben LP, (ii) holders of a majority of the voting power of the Ben LP\u2019s Common Units entitled to vote (excluding voting Common Units owned by the general partner and its affiliates), or (iii) the general partner acting without a subjective belief that such decision was adverse to the interests of Ben LP. Potential conflicts of interest may arise among the general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and Beneficient, on the other hand, and the general partner may be able to favor its own interest to the detriment of Beneficient and the holders of the Ben LP common units.\nIf certain events occur, GWG Holdings will lose its right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of the general partner of Ben LP and therefore its ability to exercise control over Ben LP and consolidate its financial results. In addition, GWG Holdings has entered into the Term Sheet that provides for it to relinquish certain rights with respect to Beneficient, including GWG Holdings\u2019 ability to appoint a majority of the board of directors of the general partner of Ben LP and control the activities of Beneficient.\nIn connection with the Investment Agreement, GWG Holdings acquired the right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of Beneficient Management. As a result, GWG Holdings reports the results of Ben LP and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis beginning on the transaction date of December 31, 2019. GWG Holdings\u2019 right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of Beneficient Management will terminate in the event (i) GWG Holdings\u2019 ownership of the fully diluted equity of Ben LP (excluding equity issued upon the conversion or exchange of Preferred Series A Unit Accounts of BCH held as of December 31, 2019 by parties other than GWG Holdings) is less than 25%, (ii) the Continuing Directors of GWG Holdings cease to constitute a majority of the board of directors of GWG Holdings, or (iii) certain bankruptcy events occur with respect to GWG Holdings. The term \u201cContinuing Directors\u201d means, as of any date of determination, any member of the board of directors of GWG Holdings who: (1) was a member of the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings on December 31, 2019; or (2) was nominated for election or elected to the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings at the time of such nomination or election. In addition, GWG Holdings entered into the Term Sheet that provides for GWG Holdings no longer having the right to appoint directors of the board of directors of Beneficient Management and Beneficient no longer being a consolidated subsidiary of GWG Holdings. If any such events occur, GWG Holdings may no longer have the right to control Ben LP and consolidate its financial results, which could have a material negative effect on our financial condition.\nGWG Holdings\u2019 percentage ownership in Ben LP may be diluted significantly.\nGWG Holdings currently owns approximately 96% of the issued and outstanding common units in Ben LP. This percentage ownership does not take into account (i) limited partner interests that may be issued upon the conversion of outstanding securities issued by Ben LP or its affiliates, or (ii) additional limited partner interests that may be issued, and Ben LP is currently seeking to raise capital through the issuance of limited partner interests. Taking these issuances into account, as well as potential payments in Ben LP common units under the Seller Trust L Bonds, GWG Holdings\u2019 ownership interest in Ben LP common units could be reduced significantly below 25%. In addition, Beneficient Management has discretion to cause Ben LP to issue additional limited partner interests from time to time, and Ben LP\u2019s partnership agreement contains no meaningful restrictions on this authority. Moreover, the Beneficient organizational structure permits the future issuance of additional securities that can, upon certain circumstances or at the discretion of their holders, be converted into additional limited partner interests in Ben LP. Should any of these actions be taken, GWG Holdings\u2019 percentage ownership in Ben LP will be diluted.\nA failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect our financial results.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. GWG Holdings identified a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting in the quarterly income tax provision process, which included the measurement of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which was reported in GWG Holdings\u2019 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. In addition, in connection with matters related to the Restatement, we have determined that a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting for all periods from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the selection, application and review of the implementation of accounting policies were not sufficient to ensure amounts recorded and disclosed were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. This material weakness resulted in the Restatement. As a result of these material weaknesses, GWG Holdings\u2019 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe continue to evaluate, design and implement controls and procedures under a remediation plan designed to address these material weaknesses. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nGWG Holdings is a smaller reporting company for SEC reporting purposes and has historically had limited accounting and financial reporting resources. Prior to the December 31, 2019 consolidation with GWG Holdings, Beneficient was not subject to the reporting obligations required under the Sarbanes-Oxley (\u201cSOX\u201d) Act of 2002. The consolidation of Beneficient and GWG Holdings resulted in increased accounting, reporting and internal controls complexity as the companies integrate systems and processes.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for GWG Holdings and Beneficient to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully. If either GWG Holdings or Beneficient, or both, cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our ability to accurately report financial results could be adversely affected and our reputation and operating results would be harmed. While GWG Holdings and Beneficient believe they have increased their accounting and financial reporting resources, GWG Holdings and Beneficient cannot be certain that their efforts to further establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting will be successful. Any failure to further develop, as necessary, or to maintain effective internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Refer to Item 9A. Control and Procedures for additional information regarding the material weaknesses identified.\nWe may not realize a return on GWG Holdings\u2019 investment in FOXO Technologies Inc.\nUnder the FOXO subscription agreement, GWG Holdings is obligated to invest $20.0 million in FOXO over a two-year period ending in October 2021, of which $16.2 million was funded as of December 31, 2020. The success of FOXO is dependent, in part, on new and unproven technology as part of its life insurance policy underwriting process. If the mortality predictions FOXO obtains through use of this technology proves inaccurate, FOXO may not generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy the terms of the distributions to us as provided in its operating agreement. Furthermore, any failure by FOXO to protect its intellectual property rights could impair its ability to protect its proprietary technology and the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 investment. As such, GWG Holdings may not realize the return contemplated in the FOXO subscription agreement, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe resale of GWG Holdings\u2019 common stock issued in the Exchange Transaction could result in a reduction in the market price of GWG Holdings\u2019 common stock and result in a destabilized trading market for GWG Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nUpon the Final Closing Date, GWG Holdings issued 27,013,516 shares of its common stock to the Seller Trusts, which in the aggregate represented approximately 83% of the outstanding common stock on that date. On September 30, 2020, the ownership of 9,837,264 shares transferred to certain of the ExAlt Trusts in connection with the Collateral Swap, as discussed in Item 1. Business. The remaining shares issued in the Exchange Transaction are subject to resale restrictions applicable to \u201crestricted securities\u201d under applicable federal securities laws. The Master Exchange Agreement and related ancillary agreements require that GWG Holdings register the resale of the shares of common stock issued in the Exchange Transaction to the Seller Trusts to the extent permitted by applicable SEC rules and regulations. Upon the effectiveness of any such registration, or the lapse of applicable resale restrictions under applicable securities laws, the shares of GWG Holdings\u2019 common stock issued in the Exchange Transaction will be available for resale in the public equity markets. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of these shares or the availability of these shares for future sale could have on the market price of GWG Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nThe Seller Trusts, collectively, have the power to control the vote of a majority of GWG Holdings\u2019 outstanding common stock, enabling them to exert significant influence over our operations, which may affect the trading price of GWG Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nAccording to their most recent Schedule 13D/A filing, the Seller Trusts own approximately 48.6% of GWG Holdings\u2019 outstanding common stock. The Seller Trusts are a group of individual common law trusts that received shares of such common stock in the Exchange Transaction. The trustee of each of the Seller Trusts is Delaware Trust Company. The trust advisors of each trust are two individuals unrelated to each other, Murray T. Holland (GWG Holdings\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer) and James E. Turvey, a Beneficient employee, who have sole decision-making authority with respect to each Seller Trust. The beneficiary of each of the Seller Trusts is MHT Financial, LLC. The current members of MHT Financial, LLC include Murray T. Holland and an entity owned by Shawn T. Terry and Mike McGill. The Seller Trusts are entitled to full voting rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock they own. Because the Seller Trusts, collectively,\nown a substantial portion of GWG Holdings\u2019 outstanding voting securities and certain ExAlt Trusts, holding approximately 29.7% of GWG Holdings\u2019 outstanding common stock according to their latest Schedule 13D/A filing have agreed to vote their shares in proportion to the votes cast by all other holders of GWG Holdings\u2019 voting securities, the Seller Trusts are entitled to cast a majority of the votes on all matters requiring stockholder votes, including, if a stockholder vote is required: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and other strategic transactions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; amendments to GWG Holdings\u2019 Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This concentrated ownership enables the Seller Trusts to exert significant influence over all of our corporate activities, including the election of directors to GWG Holdings\u2019 Board of Directors, and may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of the Seller Trusts may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of the Company. Also, the Seller Trusts may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in their judgments, could enhance their investments in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of GWG Holdings\u2019 shares could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of GWG Holdings\u2019 shares upon a change in control. In addition, this continued concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of GWG Holdings\u2019 shares because prospective investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with such significant stockholders.\nWe are currently relying on the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, pursuant to which \u201ccontrolled companies\u201d are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements otherwise applicable under Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules.\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules exempt \u201ccontrolled companies,\u201d or companies of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company, from certain corporate governance requirements, including those requirements that:\n\u2022A majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022Compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and\n\u2022Director nominees be selected or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nThe Seller Trusts that acquired GWG Holdings\u2019 shares in the Beneficient Transactions own approximately 48.6% of our common stock and are considered a group for purposes of the Nasdaq controlled company listing rule, based on the most recent Schedule 13D/A filed by the Seller Trusts and its trust advisors with the SEC, and certain of the ExAlt Trusts, holding approximately 29.7% of GWG Holdings\u2019 outstanding common stock according to their latest Schedule 13D/A filing have agreed to vote their shares in proportion to the votes cast by all other holders of GWG Holdings\u2019 voting securities. As a result, we are currently a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and are relying on the controlled company exemption for certain of the above requirements, including those related to director nomination. Accordingly, should the interests of the Seller Trusts differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders do not have the same protections generally as stockholders of other Nasdaq-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on the controlled company exemption from the specified corporate governance requirements. GWG Holdings\u2019 status as a controlled company could make GWG Holdings\u2019 common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm GWG Holdings\u2019 stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity Products Business\nBeneficient may be unable to operate its business successfully, which would negatively impact its ability to generate distributable cash flow and increase the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient.\nWe operate our liquidity products business through our consolidated subsidiary Ben LP and its subsidiaries. The success of our liquidity products business will depend primarily on Beneficient\u2019s ability to operate its business successfully, generate distributable cash flow, and increase the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient. If Beneficient is unable to do so, such inability will negatively impact our operations and liquidity and may result in an impairment of goodwill. Beneficient does not have significant operating history under its current business plan. Additionally, Ben LP\u2019s proposed trust company subsidiary has no operating history. In general, companies that seek to implement these kinds of business plans present substantial business and financial risks and uncertainties. Furthermore, to date, Ben LP\u2019s originations of liquidity products have been transacted primarily with a limited number of family offices, fund-of-funds and institutions. These types of customers, specifically fund-of-funds and institutions, may not represent the target market of Beneficient\u2019s liquidity products in the future, and Beneficient has only recently begun transactions with individual investors.\nBecause Beneficient represents a significant percentage of our consolidated assets, the impact on our consolidated financial statements of Beneficient\u2019s financial performance is likely to be material.\nBeneficient may not obtain an unconditional Kansas TEFFI charter and has experienced significant delays in obtaining a trust company charter, which outcome would hinder Beneficient\u2019s ability to successfully pursue its current business plan and could adversely affect the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient.\nBeneficient\u2019s liquidity products are designed to facilitate the delivery, at a customer\u2019s election, of cash, equity securities or debt securities, or a combination of cash and equity or debt securities for their alternative assets. In order to further grow these businesses, BFF is seeking to obtain an unconditional TEFFI charter in Kansas and a non-depository trust company charter in Texas. Each of those proposed institutions may not commence operations until it receives its respective unconditional charter.\nIn April 2021, the Kansas Legislature adopted, and the governor of Kansas signed into law, a bill that would allow for the chartering and creation of Kansas TEFFI trust companies that provide fiduciary financing, custodian and trustee services to participants in the alternative assets market known as TEFFIs, as well as the establishment of alternative asset trusts. The legislation, which names BFF as the pilot TEFFI, became effective on July 1, 2021. As part of the pilot program, BFF received a conditional charter on July 1, 2021, and has applied for a final operational charter. Upon issuance of a final operational charter, Beneficient expects to conduct its liquidity business through BFF as a Kansas TEFFI. While Beneficient expects that it will establish an operational Kansas TEFFI trust company with a permanent unconditional charter, its ability to do so is not assured, in part because BFF\u2019s initial charter will be a part of a pilot program that could last until July 1, 2022 during which it will not be authorized to conduct operations. Until that time, BFF will not be authorized to conduct operations as a TEFFI. There can be no assurance that BFF will receive an unconditional TEFFI charter following the pilot program. Further, in connection with the expected receipt of a Kansas TEFFI charter, BFF is anticipated to become subject to regulation by the Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner and new rules and regulations that it would be expected to promulgate throughout and following the pilot program. Such regulations could prove to be burdensome on Beneficient\u2019s business and could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations. Beneficient filed limited trust association charter applications for two proposed trust companies (one to offer liquidity products and the other to offer custodial and trustee services) with the Texas Department of Banking in September of 2018 and submitted revised charter applications on March 6, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Texas Department of Banking delivered guidance to Beneficient that it does not require a trust company charter for Beneficient to offer its liquidity products to customers, and, as a result, on November 25, 2020, Beneficient withdrew its charter application with respect to the liquidity products. However, Beneficient is exploring whether it would be advantageous to continue pursuing a trust company charter to provide its liquidity products. Beneficient\u2019s charter application with respect to offering custodial and trustee services remains under review by Texas Department of Banking. Approval of this application is not assured.\nBecause Beneficient\u2019s current business plans are based in part on obtaining regulatory approval to operate a regulated trust company, a failure to do so may materially and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects, which would likely negatively impact our results of operations and may result in impairment of goodwill.\nEven if the Kansas TEFFI is established or the Texas charter application is approved, Beneficient expects that the approval will be subject to certain conditions including, among others, that each proposed entity satisfies certain minimum restricted capital requirements. There is no assurance that Beneficient will be able to satisfy all the conditions imposed by the Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner or the Texas Department of Banking in connection with its approval. In addition, such conditions could delay the anticipated time for commencement of fiduciary operations.\nBeneficient may not be able to grow, effectively manage its growth, or achieve profitability.\nA principal focus of Beneficient\u2019s liquidity products strategy is to expand the number of Beneficient\u2019s product offerings and grow Beneficient\u2019s trust administration products and services. Beneficient\u2019s future growth depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond Beneficient\u2019s ability to control. These factors include Beneficient\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022accurately assess the demand for and sell the products and offerings that Beneficient has developed and expects to develop to meet demand;\n\u2022compete against other customer solutions and vendors;\n\u2022maintain the quality of Beneficient\u2019s trust administration products and services;\n\u2022effectively manage Beneficient\u2019s financing underwriting and risk criteria and manage diversification, including with effective risk management discipline;\n\u2022update Beneficient\u2019s products and offerings and develop new products and offerings for which its customers will be willing to exchange their alternative assets;\n\u2022properly scale its internal organization and infrastructure to accommodate the development and commercialization of its existing products and products in development; and\n\u2022hire, train and retain qualified personnel to manage and operate Beneficient\u2019s business as it is expected to grow.\nA deficiency in any of these factors could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s ability to achieve or manage growth or profitability.\nBeneficient is subject to repayment risk in connection with its liquidity transactions.\nBeneficient\u2019s liquidity transactions include making ExAlt Loans, which are collateralized by the Collateral. ExAlt Loans do not require repayment prior to maturity and are subject to a risk of default. Because the trusts that borrow from the lending operating subsidiary of Ben Liquidity under such ExAlt Loans are controlled by an unaffiliated third-party trust advisor with investment discretion over the Collateral, any such borrower trusts may default on an ExAlt Loan even if the cash flow from alternative assets comprising the Collateral supporting any such ExAlt Loan is sufficient to otherwise repay interest and principal.\nBeneficient may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nBeneficient seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure by developing an effective risk and control framework, which encompasses a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance, and legal reporting systems; internal controls; management review processes; and other mechanisms. While Beneficient employs and will continue to develop and deploy risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every risk event in all market environments or the specific nature of the impact and timing of such outcomes. Beneficient\u2019s failure to manage risk effectively could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nBeneficient may be able to offer only a limited number of products and solutions.\nBeneficient may be able to offer only a limited number of products and solutions due to regulatory, capital or other restrictions. Accordingly, the prospects for Beneficient\u2019s success may be solely dependent upon the performance of a single or limited products or solutions, or dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products or solutions. A lack of diversification in its offerings may make Beneficient\u2019s results of operations susceptible to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory conditions, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon Beneficient\u2019s ability to operate its business and/or grow its business in the future. Further, Beneficient would not be able to diversify its operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses that offering a comprehensive suite of solutions could provide.\nBeneficient depends on the accuracy and completeness of information from and about customers.\nIn making an assessment regarding the alternative assets underlying a potential liquidity transaction, Beneficient may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of customers, including financial statements and other financial information. Beneficient also may rely on representations of customers as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in connection with liquidity transactions, Beneficient may rely on information provided by a customer such as net asset value of an underlying alternative asset. Beneficient also relies, and will continue to rely, on customer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants\u2019 reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of the assets underlying the liquidity transaction. While Beneficient believes that its underwriting process is thorough and robust, its necessary reliance on customers may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including bribery, fraud or other illegal activities) or risks that are necessary or helpful in evaluating such transaction opportunity. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect and may be more widespread in certain jurisdictions. Beneficient\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if Beneficient relies on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nDifficult market conditions can cause investors to reduce or suspend their investments in alternative assets or their desire to liquidate alternative assets they hold, which could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business.\nBeneficient\u2019s business depends upon the health of the market for investments in alternative assets. During economic downturns, alternative asset owners may suffer from decreasing returns (including negative returns and loss of principal investment), liquidity pressure, increased volatility and difficulty maintaining targeted asset allocations, and investors may\ndecrease or suspend making new fund investments during and after such periods. As the economy begins to recover from these periods, investors may elect to reduce their exposure to alternative investments, resulting in a smaller overall pool of potential customers in the industry and customers for Beneficient\u2019s products and services in the future. In the event all or part of this occurs, when trying to find new customers Beneficient will be competing for fewer available alternative assets to administer in an increasingly competitive environment, which could lead to terms less favorable to Beneficient as well as difficulty in reaching new customers. Such changes would adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nBeneficient is dependent on the continued success of the alternative asset industry.\nBeneficient\u2019s success depends, in part, on the continued success of alternative asset managers and the alternative asset industry that has enjoyed a prolonged period of expansion and profitability. Such expansion and profitability is subject to market conditions and other factors outside of Beneficient\u2019s control (and the control of managers of alternative assets). There is no assurance that such expansion and profitability will continue. Beyond business and financial success, the alternative asset industry may also become subject to greater governmental regulation and investigation, which could have a negative effect on Beneficient.\nA failure of Beneficient to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business.\nBeneficient has developed procedures and controls designed to identify and address conflicts of interest relevant to its business operations. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and Beneficient\u2019s reputation could be damaged, and the willingness of customers to enter into transactions with Beneficient may be affected, if Beneficient fails, or appears to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nTransfer restrictions applicable to alternative assets may prevent Beneficient from being able to attract a sufficient number of customers to achieve Beneficient\u2019s business goals.\nMany alternative assets contain stringent transfer restrictions imposed by the issuing entity, which may prevent Beneficient from entering into liquidity transactions or providing trust administration services with respect to such assets. Such restrictions may result in Beneficient not being able to attract a sufficient number of customers or liquidity transactions and, as a result, its revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.\nBeneficient\u2019s business, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, the ExAlt Trusts that owe Ben Liquidity money, securities or other assets or obligations collateralizing the ExAlt Loans held by Ben Liquidity.\nBeneficient is exposed to the risk that the ExAlt Trusts that owe Ben Liquidity money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to Ben Liquidity due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect Ben Liquidity.\nBeneficient uses hedging transactions to manage certain market risks; Beneficient\u2019s business, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by unanticipated market conditions including interest rates, currency exchange rates, equity market behavior, and other relevant market factors that generate losses not covered or offset by a hedge.\nWhen managing its exposure to market risks, Beneficient may make use of forward contracts, options, swaps, caps, collars and floors and may pursue other strategies or use other forms of derivative instruments to limit its exposure to changes in the relative values of investments that may result from market developments, including changes in prevailing interest rates and currency exchange rates. On July 17, 2020, Ben LP, through its subsidiary CT Risk Management, L.L.C., made aggregate payments of $14.8 million to purchase put options against a decrease in the S&P 500 Index. The options have an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million and are designed to protect the net asset value of the interests in alternative assets that generate the collateral to Beneficient\u2019s loan portfolio against market risk. One-half of the put options expire in July 2022 with the remaining put options expiring in July 2023.\nThe use of hedging transactions and other derivative instruments to reduce the effects of changes in the value of a position does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the value of the position or prevent losses if the value of the position declines. However, such activities can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of the position. Such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a position increases. Moreover, it may not be possible to limit the exposure to a market development that is so generally\nanticipated that a hedging or other derivative transaction cannot be entered into at an acceptable price. Although Beneficient has entered into and may continue to enter into hedging transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks, unanticipated market changes may result in poorer overall investment performance than if the transaction had not been executed. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in connection with hedging activities and price movements in a position being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, Beneficient may not be successful in establishing a sufficient correlation or a sufficient matching of cash flows between the instruments used in a hedging or other derivative transaction and the position being hedged. An insufficient correlation could prevent Beneficient from achieving the intended result and create new risks of loss. In addition, Beneficient will not be able to fully limit exposure against all changes in the values of the alternative assets underlying its liquidity transactions, because the values of such assets are likely to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which will be beyond Beneficient\u2019s control, and it may not be able to respond to such fluctuations in a timely manner or at all.\nBeneficient\u2019s fair value estimates of illiquid assets may not accurately estimate prices obtained at the time of sale and Beneficient cannot provide assurance that the values of the alternative assets underlying the liquidity transactions that it reports from time to time will be realized.\nAsset valuations for which there is no readily available market, such as the illiquid assets comprising the Collateral, require estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Given this uncertainty, the fair values of such assets as reflected in estimated net asset value may not reflect the prices that would actually be obtained if and when such assets were sold.\nUnder Beneficient\u2019s valuation policy, Beneficient bases its estimates of the fair value of the alternative assets in the Collateral on the fund reported net asset value provided to it by the underlying fund managers. Because alternative asset managers generally hold a high proportion of their investments in assets for which market prices are not readily available, fund reported net asset value will necessarily incorporate estimates of fair value made by the fund managers. As there is no single method for determining fair value, there may be significant variations in the valuation policies used by different fund managers in the Collateral.\nIn addition, due to time lags in receiving valuation information from fund managers, Beneficient typically does not and will not have up-to-date information from all underlying funds at the time it calculates the fair value of the alternative assets underlying the liquidity transactions. Beneficient typically is not and will not be aware of all material developments at a fund or its underlying portfolio companies that could adversely affect the value of the funds in the Collateral.\nEven if market quotations are available for the alternative assets underlying the liquidity transactions, such quotations may not reflect the value that could actually be realized because of various factors, including the possible illiquidity associated with a large ownership position, subsequent illiquidity in the market for a company\u2019s securities, future market price volatility or the potential for a future loss in market value. Realizations at values significantly lower than the fair values recorded in Beneficient\u2019s financial statements could have a material adverse effect on the net asset value of the alternative asset, and therefore the value of the beneficial interests and the corresponding liquidity transactions.\nFurthermore, a substantial majority of the net assets of Beneficient, and a significant portion of the net assets of GWG Holdings on a consolidated basis, are currently represented by intangible assets and goodwill. Management performs goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing annually, during the fourth quarter, or when events occur, or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate impairment has occurred. For 2020, the annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairment charges. Our evaluation utilized multiple assumptions, including estimated discounted cash flows and other estimates that may change over time. While our assumption reflects management\u2019s best estimates of future performance, the estimates assume Beneficient capturing a significant market share of liquidity transactions during the next five years leading to a substantial rate of growth of new service offerings and products, revenues and assets over the next five years ending December 31, 2025. These estimations are uncertain to occur, and to the extent the Company falls short of achieving our expected growth in revenues and assets over the next four years, material impairments of our goodwill may occur in the near term. Moreover, in light of Beneficient\u2019s significant recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, and delays in executing its business plans, there could be potential triggering events identified and resulting impairment of goodwill recorded during the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2021. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the reporting unit's goodwill balance. Goodwill impairment exists when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. If management concludes that a portion of goodwill is impaired, we would be required to write down the value of such goodwill, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nNotwithstanding its diversification strategies, Beneficient\u2019s liquidity, profitability and business may be adversely affected by concentrations of assets comprising the Collateral.\nAlthough Beneficient monitors the diversity of its collateral portfolio through the use of concentration guidelines, the Collateral may be concentrated in certain issuers, funds, sectors, geographic regions, countries, or asset types, which could negatively affect performance as well as Beneficient\u2019s financial results, including Beneficient\u2019s capital position, earnings, cash flows, and growth.\nSimilarly, Beneficient may have significant exposures to certain issuers, industries, or asset classes. As a result, Beneficient\u2019s net cash flows and asset valuations (e.g., net asset value) may exhibit greater volatility due to idiosyncratic factors specific to companies, industries, regions, and asset classes. Moreover, because of such concentrations, Beneficient may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for Beneficient\u2019s competitors.\nIn the case of Beneficient\u2019s exposure to investments in publicly traded companies, its operating results would be impacted by volatility in the public markets generally and in the stock prices of such companies.\nThe due diligence process that Beneficient undertakes in connection with liquidity transactions may or may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with such liquidity transaction, and even if Beneficient receives complete and accurate information it may not translate to identifying the appropriate underwriting criteria.\nBefore offering liquidity solutions to customers, Beneficient conducts due diligence that it deems reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each transaction. When conducting due diligence, Beneficient may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, technological, environmental, social, governance and legal and regulatory issues. In addition to Beneficient\u2019s own employees, outside consultants, legal advisors and accountants may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment and the parties involved. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding the alternative assets behind a potential liquidity transaction, Beneficient relies on the resources available to it, including information provided by the potential customer of the liquidity transaction, the general partners and managers of the alternative assets the customer holds, and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations, and such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment ultimately being successful. Moreover, even in the event that Beneficient receives complete and accurate information in the due diligence process, it may not translate to identifying the appropriate underwriting criteria, which could result in negative reputational effects, and/or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on Beneficient\u2019s ability to collect and analyze data regarding its customers\u2019 alternative assets investments could adversely affect its business.\nThe Collateral is generated by interests in alternative assets. Beneficient depends on the continuation of its relationships with the general partners and sponsors of the underlying funds and investments in order to maintain current data on these alternative assets. The termination of such relationships or the imposition of restrictions on its ability to use the data it obtains for its reporting and monitoring services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Beneficient\u2019s monitoring is also dependent on the statements and conduct of personnel at investment managers of the general partners of these alternative asset firms. To the extent that the beliefs and expectations of these managers turn out to be inaccurate, Beneficient\u2019s expectations as part of its monitoring process may be materially impacted.\nRisks Related to Our Secondary Life Insurance Business\nThe valuation of our life insurance policy assets on our balance sheet requires us to make material assumptions that may ultimately prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove incorrect, we could suffer significant losses that materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOne of our principal assets is a portfolio of life insurance policies purchased in the secondary market, comprising approximately 64% and 62% of our total assets, excluding goodwill, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Those assets are considered \u201cLevel 3\u201d fair value measurements under Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\u201cASC 820\u201d), as there is currently no active market where we are able to observe quoted prices for identical assets. As a result, our determination of fair value for those assets on our balance sheet incorporates significant inputs that are not observable. A sale of the portfolio or a portion of the portfolio in an other than orderly transaction would likely occur at less than the fair value of the respective life insurance policies.\nA Level 3 fair value measurement is inherently uncertain and could create additional volatility in our financial statements that is not necessarily related to the performance of our underlying assets. As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, we estimated\nthe fair value discount rate for our life insurance portfolio to be 8.25%. Life expectancy estimates are also a significant component within our fair value measurement. If in the future we determine that a higher discount rate is required to ascribe fair value to a similarly situated portfolio of life insurance policies or that life expectancy estimates materially differ from actuarial estimates and/or our projections, we could experience significant losses materially affecting our results of operations. In addition, significant losses of this nature would likely at some point cause us to be out of compliance with borrowing covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements as well as cause our common stock to decline in value. This could in turn result in acceleration of the LNV Credit Facility, the NF Credit Facility, and GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds (including the Seller Trust L Bonds and Liquidity Bonds issued in connection with Beneficient liquidity transactions), which we may not be able to repay. As a result, we may be forced to seek additional debt or equity financing to repay such debt amounts, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf we are unable to repay our debt when it comes due, then our senior lender or the holders of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds, or both, would have the right to foreclose on our assets, and investors in our securities could lose all or a portion of their investment.\nActual results from our life insurance portfolio may not match our projected results, which could adversely affect our ability to service our existing portfolio and meet our debt obligations.\nOur business partially relies on achieving actual results that are materially in line with the results we expect to attain from our investments in life insurance policy assets. In this regard, we believe that the larger the portfolio of life insurance we own, the greater the likelihood that we will achieve our expected results. To our knowledge, rating agencies generally suggest that portfolios of life insurance policies contain enough policies on individual lives to achieve actuarial stability in receiving expected cash flows. For instance, in a life insurance securitization methodology published in 2016, A.M. Best Company concluded that at least 300 lives are necessary to achieve actuarial stability, while Standard & Poor\u2019s has indicated that stability is unlikely to be achieved with less than 1,000 lives. As of December 31, 2020, we owned $1.9 billion in face value of life insurance policies covering 978 unique lives. Based on recent changes in the capital markets, specifically the availability of financing on favorable terms, we have begun exploring the feasibility of additional future purchases of life insurance policies through the secondary market. These operations are in addition to allocating capital to provide liquidity to a broader range of alternative assets, which GWG Holdings currently provides through investments in Beneficient. In the absence of purchasing additional life insurance policies, the number of life insurance policies that comprise our portfolio will decrease over time as policies mature, which may negatively impact the actuarial stability of our portfolio.\nHowever, even if our life insurance portfolio is actuarially stable, we still may experience differences between the projection models we use and actual mortalities. Differences between our expectations and actual mortality results could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. In such a case, we may face liquidity problems, including difficulties servicing our remaining portfolio of policies and servicing our outstanding debt obligations. Continued or material failures to meet our expected results could decrease the attractiveness of our securities in the eyes of potential investors, thereby making it even more difficult to obtain capital needed meet our capital needs. Failure to meet our capital needs could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position and may lead to our security holders losing all or a portion of their investment in the Company.\nOur investments in life insurance policies have inherent risks, including fraud and legal challenges to the validity of the policies, which we will be unable to eliminate and which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face certain risks associated with insurance fraud and other legal challenges to the validity of the policy. For example, to the extent the insured is not aware of the existence of the policy, the insured does not exist, or the insurance company does not recognize the policy, the insurance company may cancel or rescind the policy thereby causing the loss of an investment in that policy. In addition, if an insured\u2019s medical records have been altered in such a way as to shorten a life expectancy as reported, this may cause us to overpay for the related policy. Finally, we may experience legal challenges from insurance companies claiming that the insured failed to have an insurable interest at the time the policy was originally purchased or that the policy owner made fraudulent disclosures to the insurer at the time the policy was purchased (e.g., disclosures pertaining to the health status of the insured or the existence or sources of premium financing), or challenges from the beneficiaries of an insurance policy claiming that the sale of the policy to us was invalid.\nTo mitigate these risks, our origination practices and underwriting procedures, when we were purchasing policies, included a current verification of coverage from the insurance company, a complete due-diligence investigation of the insured and accompanying medical records, a review of the life insurance policy application, and a requirement that the policy has been in force for at least two years. We also conducted a legal review of any premium financing associated with the policy to determine if an insurable interest existed at the time of its issuance. Nevertheless, these steps will not eliminate the risk of fraud or legal challenges to the life insurance policies we own. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or the\ninterpretation of existing laws or regulations, may prove our due-diligence and risk-mitigation efforts inadequate. If a significant face amount of policies were invalidated for reasons of fraud or any other reason, our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur ownership of life insurance policies issued by insurers that are unable to pay claims presented to them could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation and our financial condition.\nWe currently rely on the payment of policy claims by insurers as our most significant source of revenue collection. In essence, the life insurance assets we own represent the obligations of insurers to pay the benefit amount under the relevant policy upon the mortality of the insured. As a result, in our business, we face the \u201ccredit risk\u201d that a particular insurer will be financially unable to pay claims when and as they become due. Depending on how many policies we own that are issued by insurers having financial difficulties at the time a claim is presented for payment, this risk could be significant enough to have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation, our financial condition, or even our overall prospects.\nTo mitigate this credit risk, we generally purchased policies issued only by insurers with an investment-grade credit rating from one or more of Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s, or A.M. Best Company. As of December 31, 2020, 96.3% of the face value benefits of our life insurance policies were issued by insurers having an investment-grade credit rating (BBB or better) by Standard & Poor\u2019s. We also review our exposure to credit risk associated with our portfolio of life insurance policies when estimating its fair value. In evaluating the policies\u2019 credit risk, we consider items such as insurance company solvency, credit risk indicators, and general economic conditions. Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate credit risk exposure and to reflect this risk in our portfolio valuation, we cannot predict with any certainty whether a particular insurer will be in a financial position to satisfy amounts that it owes under life insurance policies it has issued when a claim for payment is presented or whether a particular credit rating accurately reflects the risks associated with such life insurance policies.\nWe have relied materially on information provided or obtained by third parties in the acquisition of life insurance policies. Any misinformation or negligence in the course of obtaining information could materially and adversely affect the value of the policies we own, our results of operation and the value of our securities.\nOur acquisition of each life insurance policy was negotiated based on variables and particular facts unique to the policy itself and the health of the insured. The facts we obtained about the policies and the insured at the time when the policy was applied for and obtained were based on the insured\u2019s factual representations to the insurance company, and the facts the insurance company separately obtained in the course of its own due-diligence examination, such as facts concerning the health of the insured and whether or not there is an insurable interest present when the policy was issued. Any misinformation or negligence in the course of obtaining information relating to a policy or insured could materially and adversely impact the value of the policies we own and could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our securities.\nIf actuarial assumptions related to our investments in life insurance policies change, our operating results and cash flow could be adversely affected, as well as the value of our collateral and our ability to service our debt obligations.\nWhen we were acquiring life insurance policies, the expected internal rates of return we calculated were based upon the probability of an insured\u2019s mortality over an actuarial life expectancy estimate. We obtained these estimates from third-party medical-actuarial underwriting companies. In addition to actuarial life expectancies, we relied on a pricing and premium forecasting software model developed by a third-party actuarial firm for the valuation of policies we purchased, future mortality revenues, and the calculation of anticipated internal rates of return. These pricing models forecast the estimated future premiums due as well the future mortalities of insureds.\nAll actuarial life expectancies (and related forecasting software) are subject to interpretation and change based on evolving medical technology, actuarial data, and analytical techniques. Additionally, we were required under the LNV Credit Facility to update life expectancy estimates for pledged life insurance policies with face amounts greater than $750,000 by December 18, 2020, and obtain updated life expectancy updates no less frequently than once every five years. Additionally, we are required, under the NF Credit Facility, to use commercially reasonable efforts to update life expectancies on a biannual basis. Our prior experience in updating life expectancies has generally resulted in longer life expectancies for most, but not all, of the insureds within our portfolio. Adverse impacts on the value of our life insurance policy portfolio or our cash flow could in turn impair the value of the collateral we have pledged to our creditors and our ability to service our debt and obligations as they come due.\nInaccuracies in the life expectancy estimates we used for small face policies at the time of purchase could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 633 \u201csmall face\u201d life insurance policies (i.e., those policies with $1 million in face value of benefits or less) having $364.6 million in aggregate face value of benefits.\nThe underwriting processes we used to evaluate, price and purchase small face policies were different from, and may not have been as reliable as, the processes we used for life insurance policies with larger face values of benefits. In particular, the processes we used to develop or obtain life expectancy estimates and the related mortality curves for small face policies were less extensive than traditional methods. These processes included obtaining either a single fully underwritten or simplified report as opposed to two fully underwritten reports. A simplified third-party underwriting report is based on a self-reported medical interview and may be supplemented with additional information obtained from a pharmacy benefit manager database that is provided to one or more medical-actuarial underwriting firms to obtain a simplified life expectancy report. Although we obtained professional actuarial guidance regarding these processes, our simplified underwriting methodology may not have been as reliable as the processes we use for policies with larger (i.e., greater than $1 million) face value of benefits.\nAny shortcomings in the process we used to evaluate, price, purchase and value our small face policies, or significant inaccuracies in the life expectancy estimates relating to those policies, could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any such outcomes could have a negative and possibly material effect on our ability to satisfy our debts.\nWe rely on estimated rates of mortality when valuing life insurance policies and forecasting the performance of our life insurance portfolio, and we also rely on other estimates derived from statistical methodologies for projecting our future cash flows. If any of our estimates prove to be incorrect, it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to satisfy our capital needs including debt service and repayment obligations.\nIf we project we will receive cash inflows from policies sooner than we actually do, we may not be able to make payment on our debt obligations in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, a significant medical discovery or advance that results in mortality improvements among seniors could have a material adverse effect on the value of our life insurance investments.\nWe use a modeling practice for projecting cash flows known as the \u201cprobabilistic method\u201d. This is an actuarial method that uses the probability of an insured\u2019s mortality over time (a mortality curve) to project the flow of policy benefits to us and to project premiums that must be paid by us. This method requires the input of life expectancy assumptions. These inputs are then used to estimate the discounted cash flows from the life insurance portfolio using the ClariNet LS probabilistic and stochastic portfolio pricing model from ClearLife Limited, which estimates the expected cash flows using various mortality probabilities and scenarios.\nOur Longest Life Expectancy valuation methodology uses the Longest Life Expectancy report result at the time of purchase combined with a multiplier factor applied for variance in our portfolio of actual to expected experience using the Longest Life Expectancy results. Our methodology uses a static portfolio multiplier we must recalculate anytime the six-month moving average of the difference between actual portfolio performance and projected performance of cumulative face value maturities deviates by more than one standard deviation from the mean and such deviation persists for three consecutive months and continues as of the current quarter-end month. As of December 31, 2020, the six-month moving average of the difference between actual portfolio performance and projected performance of cumulative face value of maturities was within one standard deviation from the mean. As such, our valuation methodology did not require an update to our portfolio mortality multiplier (\u201cPMM\u201d).\nWe use the current future cash flow projection to generate our expected internal rate of return on the life insurance policy portfolio we own. Any change to these projections, pricing models, methodology, premium forecasting assumptions, cash flow projections, or mortality assumptions accompanied therewith that increase the projected cost-of-insurance premiums or decrease the probability of mortality could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and financial condition. Ultimately, this could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt service and repayment obligations and could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nCost-of-insurance (premium) increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risk of increased cost-of-insurance (\u201cCOI\u201d) charges (i.e., premium charges) for the universal life insurance policies we own in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 31% of the policies in our life insurance portfolio have premium levels that are guaranteed under the terms of the policy to keep the policy\u2019s death benefit in force even in a situation where the policy\u2019s cash account has been wholly depleted. On the remaining approximately 69% of our policies, we pay \u201cnon-guaranteed COI charges\u201d and are subject to the risk that the insurer could increase the COI charges for the policy. In all cases, the amount of increase is subject to any limits that may be set forth in the insurance policy and must be approved by the applicable state regulator. Because very few of the policies we own have significant cash account value balances, any COI increase will require us to use more cash to satisfy the minimum premium amount required to keep the related policy in force, and this could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nA COI increase can also be expected to impair the value of the affected policy because extra expense (i.e., additional premium amounts) will be required to keep the policy in force, and such extra expense will diminish the economic value, or return, of the policy realized upon the mortality of the insured. As a result, any widespread COI increases in policies we own would likely have a material and adverse effect on the value of our life insurance portfolio, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nOur business and prospects may be adversely affected by changes, lack of growth, or increased competition in the life insurance secondary market.\nThe growth of the secondary life insurance policy market may be negatively affected by a variety of factors beyond our control, including: negative publicity about the life insurance secondary market based on actual or perceived abuses; and the adoption of additional governmental regulation.\nThe relatively new and evolving nature of the market in which we operate makes the related risks difficult to identify and quantify. Nevertheless, contractions in the secondary market for life insurance policies, whether resulting from general economic conditions, regulatory or legal pressures, or otherwise (including regulatory pressures exerted on us or others involved in the secondary market for life insurance), could make participation in the market generally less desirable. This could in turn depress the prices at which life insurance policies on the secondary market are bought and sold and have a negative impact on the estimated value of the policies we own. If the value of the policies we own decreases, our results of operation and financial condition could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Insurance Business\nWe have no experience in operating an insurance business and our entry into the insurance market may not be successful.\nBeneficient\u2019s business plan involves, through Ben Insurance, entering into the business of providing insurance policies to managers of, and investors in, alternative asset funds, such as private equity funds, for specified losses arising from indemnification and related obligations to the funds. GWG Holdings is also exploring opportunities to provide life insurance products related to its life insurance business. Entering the insurance business will subject us to additional laws and regulations and involve additional risks, including risks relating to regulatory oversight and examinations, risks related to compliance with capital maintenance requirements, and increased risks of litigation. Although certain of our directors and management have experience operating insurance businesses, we have no experience in operating an insurance business, which will enhance these risks. Attempts to expand our business involve a number of risks, including the required investment of capital and other resources, increasing demands on operational and management systems and controls, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business, and the ability to implement an effective marketing strategy to promote awareness of our insurance products. The insurance industry is highly competitive and there can be no assurance that our plans to enter the insurance market will be successful. If our proposed insurance business does not generate sufficient revenue or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nBeneficient\u2019s failure to obtain or maintain approval of insurance regulators and other regulatory authorities as required for the operations of an insurance subsidiary may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs a part of Beneficient\u2019s business plan, through Ben Insurance, Beneficient may seek to obtain a license to offer insurance products from the Kansas Insurance Department. If and when Beneficient receives the necessary regulatory approvals, Beneficient intends to offer certain insurance products, including, but not limited to, insurance policies to managers of, and investors in, alternative asset funds, such as private equity funds, for specified losses arising from indemnification and related obligations related to the funds and transfer and assignment policies to buyers and sellers of interests in funds to cover risks attendant transfers pursuant to transactions such as the liquidity transactions. Kansas insurance statutes and regulations and the policies of the Kansas Insurance Department may require Beneficient to, among other things, maintain a minimum level of capital and surplus, satisfy solvency standards, restrict dividends and distributions, obtain prior approval or provide notification of certain transactions, have at least one director or manager be a resident of Kansas, maintain a principal place of business in Kansas and hold at least one meeting in Kansas annually, and provide for the performance of certain periodic examinations of our insurance subsidiary and its financial conditions.\nIn addition, Beneficient has applied for regulatory approval to commence offering insurance policies through Pen, as a Bermuda Class 3 insurer. Subject to receiving the necessary regulatory approvals, Beneficient would intend to offer the same insurance policies noted above through Pen. Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations, and the policies of the BMA require that Pen, among other things, maintain a minimum level of capital and surplus, satisfy solvency standards, restrict dividends\nand distributions, obtain prior approval or provide notification to the BMA of certain transactions, maintain a head office in Bermuda, have a representative, secretary or director resident in Bermuda, appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda and provide for the performance of certain periodic examinations of itself and its financial conditions.\nA failure to meet these conditions may result in the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals or, if obtained, a suspension or revocation of Ben Insurance\u2019s authority to do business as an insurance company, which would mean that Beneficient would not be able to provide the planned insurance products until the approvals are obtained or any suspension or revocation of the required approvals is resolved. If obtained, any suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals would negatively impact Beneficient\u2019s reputation in the marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our exposure to alternative assets.\nThe operation of Beneficient\u2019s proposed international insurance business, for which it has no prior experience, will subject Beneficient to additional costs and economic, political, currency and other risks that could adversely affect its revenues or financial position.\nBeneficient has no experience in operating its business internationally, which increases the risk that its proposed insurance business and any potential future expansion efforts that it may undertake may not be successful. Beneficient\u2019s operation of its proposed insurance business may face adverse financial consequences and operational problems due to political or economic changes, such as changes in political or economic conditions in Bermuda and the surrounding region, laws and regulations that restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or that could subject repatriated earnings or other funds to additional taxes, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If Beneficient invests substantial time and resources to grow its proposed insurance business and is unable to manage these risks effectively, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may increase its risks in complying with various laws and standards in Bermuda, including with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions. Expansion into new markets abroad will require additional investments by Beneficient in both regulatory approvals and marketing. These incremental costs may include hiring additional personnel, as well as engaging third-party service providers and other research and development costs. If Beneficient fails to grow its international insurance business or if growth occurs at a slower rate than expected, its business, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Beneficient\u2019s Proposed Broker-Dealer Business\nBeneficient has no experience in operating a broker-dealer business, and its entry into this market may not be successful.\nBeneficient\u2019s proposed business plan involves offering broker-dealer services to its subsidiaries and affiliates through Ben Markets and its subsidiaries, including Beneficient Capital Markets and through Ben Market\u2019s acquisition of MHT Securities, L.P. (\u201cMHT\u201d). MHT is an SEC-registered broker dealer and FINRA member that is authorized to engage in private placements of securities. On July 14, 2021, an operating subsidiary of Ben LP, Ben Markets Management Holdings, L.P. (\u201cBuyer\u201d) entered into a Transaction Agreement (the \u201cTransaction Agreement\u201d) with MHT, MHT GP Securities, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (the \u201cMHT GP\u201d), and MHT Partners, L.P., a Texas limited partnership (\u201cMHT LP\u201d and, together with MHT GP, the \u201cSellers\u201d and, together with Buyer, the \u201cTransaction Parties\u201d). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, the Buyer (i) purchased 20% of the limited partnership interests of MHT from MHT LP for an amount equal to $10,000, and (ii) agreed to (a) purchase the remaining 80% limited partnership interests of MHT from MHT LP, and (b) purchase 100% of the general partnership interests in MHT from MHT GP, in both cases for an aggregate amount equal to $40,000 (the \u201cSubsequent Closing\u201d). In addition to customary closing conditions applicable to transactions such as the ones contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, the Subsequent Closing is conditioned upon receipt from FINRA of approval of the Sellers\u2019 application for Continuing Membership Application under FINRA Rule 1017 for the remaining change in ownership (the \u201cFINRA Application\u201d) (provided that such condition is waivable by the Transaction Parties if, on the date which is forty-five (45) days after the application was submitted, the Transaction Parties have not received a material objection from FINRA to the FINRA Application or in regard to FINRA approval which is disagreeable to the Transaction Parties). Until the Subsequent Closing, MHT is not controlled by or under common control with Beneficient and is not an affiliate of Beneficient.\nBeneficient expects that operational efficiencies created by having an in-house broker-dealer will allow it to streamline its ExAlt PlanTM liquidity transactions, increase control of product distribution and reduce transaction costs. Entering into the broker-dealer business will subject Beneficient to additional laws and regulations and involve additional risks, including risks relating to regulatory oversight and examinations and increased risks of litigation. Although certain of Beneficient\u2019s directors and management have experience operating and advising broker-dealer businesses, Beneficient has no experience in operating a broker-dealer business, which will enhance these risks. Attempts to expand Beneficient\u2019s business involve a\nnumber of risks, including the required investment of capital and other resources, increasing demands on its operational and management systems and controls, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from its core business, and our ability to implement an effective marketing strategy to promote awareness of our broker-dealer products. The broker-dealer industry is highly competitive and there can be no assurance that Beneficient\u2019s plans to enter the broker-dealer market will be successful. If Beneficient\u2019s proposed broker-dealer business does not generate sufficient revenue, provide expected efficiencies or if Beneficient is unable to efficiently manage its expanded operations, Beneficient\u2019s results of operations will be adversely affected.\nBeneficient\u2019s failure to obtain or maintain approval of regulatory authorities as required for the operations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries may have a material adverse effect on its future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs a part of Beneficient\u2019s business plan, a subsidiary of Ben Markets, Beneficient Capital Markets, may seek to register as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and become a member of FINRA, and on July 14, 2021, a subsidiary of Ben Markets acquired a 20% interest in MHT pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and, following FINRA approval, will acquire the remaining 80% upon the Subsequent Closing (and following, MHT shall be renamed \u201cBen Securities Company, L.L.C.\u201d). If and when Beneficient receives the necessary regulatory approvals, Beneficient Capital Markets and MHT will be subject to regulations that cover all aspects of its business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities, the capital structure of Beneficient Capital Markets and MHT, recordkeeping, the financing of customers\u2019 purchases and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Beneficient Capital Markets and MHT will also be subject to routine periodic examination by the staff of FINRA. In addition, as a registered broker-dealer and member of a self-regulatory organization, Beneficient Capital Markets and MHT will be subject to the SEC\u2019s uniform net capital rule. Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer's assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and FINRA impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC\u2019s uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital. MHT is already subject to such requirements. Any failure to meet these conditions may result in the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals or, if obtained, a suspension or revocation of Beneficient Capital Markets\u2019 or MHT\u2019s broker-dealer license, which would mean that Beneficient would not be able to provide the planned broker-dealer products until the approvals are obtained or any suspension or revocation of the required approvals is resolved. If obtained, any suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals would negatively impact Beneficient\u2019s reputation in the marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on its ability to grow its exposure to alternative assets.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and may otherwise adversely impact our business operations. We may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1.8 billion of debt including the LNV Credit Facility, GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds (including its Seller Trust L Bonds and Liquidity Bonds issued in connection with Beneficient\u2019s liquidity transactions), and Beneficient\u2019s debt due to related parties. Beneficient\u2019s debt to HCLP Nominees, L.L.C. is due in 2022. In 2021, GWG Holdings also incurred indebtedness under the NF Credit Facility, which is due in 2031. Our indebtedness could have significant effects on our business and the holders of our debt.\nFor example, it could:\n\u2022require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which would reduce the available cash flow to fund acquisitions of alternative assets, working capital and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022require payments of principal and interest that may be greater than our cash flow from operations;\n\u2022force us to dispose of life insurance policies or other investments, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on our debt;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022restrict us from exploiting other business opportunities;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nIn addition, the LNV Credit Facility, NF Credit Facility, and Beneficient\u2019s secured loans with HCLP Nominees L.L.C. bear interest at variable rates. If interest rates increase significantly, our ability to borrow additional funds may be reduced and the risk related to our indebtedness would intensify.\nIn addition, most of our current debt is, and we anticipate that much of our future debt will be, non-amortizing and payable in balloon payments. Therefore, we will likely need to refinance most of that debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance debt as it matures or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the then-existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new debt, equity capital or sales of assets, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due. In the event we are unable to refinance debt as it becomes due, this could force us to liquidate and/or file for bankruptcy, and the collateral securing such debt may be worth less than the debt it secures, which would lead to material losses for our security holders as it relates to their investments in the Company. Additionally, we may incur significant penalties if we choose to prepay the debt.\nWe critically rely on debt financing for our business. Any inability to borrow could adversely affect our business operations, our ability to satisfy our debt-payment obligations and, ultimately, our prospects and viability.\nTo date, we have chosen to finance our business principally through the issuance of debt, including debt incurred by our subsidiary DLP IV under the LNV Credit Facility (see Note 10 to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements), DLP VI under the NF Credit Facility, GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds and Beneficient\u2019s secured loans. The LNV Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of DLP IV, has a maximum amount of $300.0 million, and the outstanding balance at December 31, 2020 was $193.7 million. The NF Credit Facility is secured by all assets of DLP VI and is fully drawn with $107.6 million outstanding as of August 31, 2021.\nObligations under the LNV Credit Facility and NF Credit Facility have maturity dates of September 27, 2029 and August 11, 2031, respectively. GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds have scheduled maturities as set forth below in the risk factor \u201cIf a significant number of holders of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds demand repayment of those instruments upon maturity instead of renewing them, and at such time we do not have sufficient capital on hand to fund those repayments (and do not otherwise have access to sufficient capital), we may be forced to liquidate some of our life insurance policies, investments in Beneficient or other assets, which could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d Our debt facilities and offerings have been the most important sources of financing on which our business continues to critically rely to grow and maintain our exposure to alternative assets - which include our portfolio of life insurance policies and GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient - as well as service existing debt and preferred stock obligations, maintaining premium payments on our life settlements portfolio and paying for operations.\nOur business model is based on increasing our exposure to alternative assets financed primarily through debt and preferred stock financing. These alternative assets are typically long-term and may not produce cash flows for an extended period of time. For example, we do not receive cash in respect of acquired life insurance policies until the insured individual dies, and Ben Liquidity may not receive payments on its ExAlt Loans until the assets underlying the Collateral have been sold by the asset manager and the unaffiliated third-party trust advisor that controls such borrower trusts elects to make a loan payment to Ben Liquidity prior to term, which is generally 12 years after the origination of any such ExAlt Loan. The resulting asset/liability mismatch can result in a liquidity shortage if we are unable to renew maturing short-term debt or secure suitable additional financing. In such a situation, we could be forced to sell assets at less than optimal (distressed) prices, or, in the event additional debt or other financings are not available, we could have to liquidate or file for bankruptcy, which would lead to material losses for our security holders as it relates to their investments in the Company. We thus rely on continued access to financing to enable us to grow our exposure to alternative assets and to pay the premiums and costs of maintaining our life insurance portfolio, all while satisfying our current interest, principal and dividend payment obligations under our debt and equity arrangements. Proceeds from life insurance policies that have been pledged under both the LNV Credit Facility and NF Credit Facility will first be applied to the repayment of our obligations under each respective credit facility according to a waterfall amortization formula that is largely controlled by each lender, respectively. Therefore, we may not receive all of the proceeds from matured life insurance policies. Accordingly, until we achieve sufficient cash flows derived from our portfolio of life insurance policies and investments in Beneficient, we expect to rely on proceeds from GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bond and preferred stock offerings to satisfy our ongoing financing and liquidity needs. Continued access to financing and liquidity under the LNV Credit Facility (other than premium payments on existing policies pledged pursuant thereto), from the offering of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds, or otherwise is not guaranteed.\nAs part of the preparation of its 2020 10-K, the Company voluntarily submitted two questions to the SEC's Office of the Chief Accountant (\u201cOCA\u201d) on February 15, 2021. OCA is responsible for accounting and auditing matters arising in the SEC\u2019s administration of the federal securities laws, particularly with respect to accounting policy determinations. In this role, OCA consults with registrants on the application of accounting standards and financial disclosure requirements. Its website indicates that registrants can expect consultations to take approximately three weeks, although that time may vary depending on various factors. The questions submitted by the Company to OCA were (1) whether the December 31, 2019 transaction resulted in GWG Holdings obtaining control of Ben LP in a transaction by entities not under common control, and (2) whether Ben LP was required to consolidate any of the ExAlt Trusts. On July 26, 2021, the Company and OCA staff held a conference call in which OCA\u2019s staff notified the Company of its conclusions on the two accounting questions that were the subject of the consultation. During that call, OCA expressed that it would object to a conclusion that Beneficient not consolidate the ExAlt Trusts as of December 31, 2019. Consistent with the conclusions communicated by OCA, on August 1, 2021, the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings determined that it is necessary to restate prior period financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, and quarterly financial statements for the first three quarters of the year ended December 31, 2020, to consolidate all of the ExAlt Trusts into Beneficient\u2019s financial statements beginning on December 31, 2019, and consequently into the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements on that same date.\nWe temporarily suspended the offering of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds, commencing April 16, 2021, as a result of our delay in filing certain periodic reports with the SEC, including this 2020 Form 10-K. We anticipate recommencing the offering of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds when we regain compliance with SEC filing requirements. Additionally, due to our failure to deliver GWG Life audited financial statements for 2020 to LNV Corporation within 90 days after the end of the year, we were in violation of our reporting obligations under the LNV Credit Facility. CLMG Corp., as administrative agent for LNV Corporation, issued a limited deferral extending the delivery of these reports to May 17, 2021. We regained compliance on May 17, 2021, when the audited annual financial statements of GWG Life were delivered to LNV Corporation.\nDuring the time period between April 16, 2021 and when we re-commence GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bond offering, we have financed, and will continue to finance, our business using cash on hand and additional financings from creditors to meet our cash needs, including cash needs for premiums on our life settlements portfolio, interest expense on outstanding bonds, bond maturities, preferred stock redemptions, preferred stock dividends, operating costs, professional fees and miscellaneous expenses. In the event that L Bond sales and/or preferred stock sales do no recover to expected levels, we may have to sell assets or find additional financing options. In such event, the terms of such sale or financings may be on less favorable terms than we have sold assets or borrowed in the past\nIn addition, general economic conditions could limit our access to financing, as could regulatory or legal pressures exerted on us, our financiers, or those involved in the procurement of financing such as brokers, dealers, and registered investment advisors. If we are unable to borrow under either the LNV Credit Facility or the NF Credit Facility or otherwise for any reason, or to renew or replace the LNV Credit Facility or NF Credit Facility when it comes due, or if we are forced to discontinue GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bond offering for any significant length of time and for any reason, our business would be adversely impacted and our ability to service and repay our debt obligations would be compromised, thereby negatively affecting our business prospects, the value of our common stock and perhaps our viability. As such, investors in our securities could lose all or a portion of their investment.\nWe may not be able to raise the capital that we are seeking from our securities offerings and may be unable to meet our overall business objective of growing and diversifying our alternative asset exposure.\nThe offer and sale of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds and preferred stock are a principal means by which we intend to raise funds needed to meet our business and financial goals. However, if we are unable to continue to do so for any reason, we may be unable to meet our goals. If actual cash flows from our portfolio of life insurance policies do not occur as we have forecasted we could be forced to sell our investments in life insurance policies in order to service or satisfy our debt-related obligations. Likewise, if GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient do not perform as we have projected, we could be forced to sell such investments in order to service or satisfy such debt-related obligations. Presently, none of GWG Holdings\u2019 material investments (life insurance policies and investments in Beneficient) are supported by liquid secondary markets and GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient contain transfer restrictions. If we are forced to sell any material amount of these investments, we may be unable to sell them at prices we believe are optimal or at or above the carrying value of such investments, particularly if our sale of assets occurs at a time when we are (or are perceived to be) in distress. In any such event, our business and the value of our securities would likely be materially and adversely impacted.\nGWG Holdings depends upon cash distributions from its subsidiaries, and contractual restrictions on distributions to GWG Holdings or adverse events at one of its operating subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect its ability to pay its debts, redeem preferred stock when requested and continue operating our business.\nGWG Holdings, Inc. is a holding company. As a holding company, GWG Holdings conducts its operations through operating subsidiaries, and as such its most significant assets are cash and its ownership interests in its subsidiaries, controlled affiliates and equity investees. Accordingly, GWG Holdings\u2019 ability to meet its obligations, including its debt-related and dividend-payment obligations, materially depends upon the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute cash to it. In this regard, the ability of GWG Holdings\u2019 subsidiaries to distribute cash to it is, and will continue to be, restricted by certain negative covenants in the agreement governing the LNV Credit Facility, the NF Credit Facility, and the credit agreements governing Beneficient\u2019s secured loans from HCLP Nominees, L.L.C. If any of these limitations were to materially impede the flow of cash to GWG Holdings, its ability to service and repay its debt, including obligations under the L Bonds, and make cash dividend payments to holders of GWG Holdings\u2019 preferred stock would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any adverse corporate event at the subsidiary level, such as a declaration of bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or an event of default under the LNV Credit Facility, the NF Credit Facility, or the credit agreements governing Beneficient\u2019s secured loans from HCLP Nominees, L.L.C., could adversely affect the ability of GWG Holdings\u2019 subsidiaries to distribute cash to it, and thereby materially and adversely affect its ability to service and repay its debt and make cash dividend payments, and negatively impact GWG Holdings ability to continue operations.\nThe collateral granted as security for our obligations under our various debt obligations may be insufficient to repay all such debt obligations upon an event of default.\nGWG Holdings and GWG Life have each granted a security interest in substantially all of their respective assets, which include GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient and GWG Life\u2019s investments in DLP IV Holdings and DLP VI Holdings, to serve as collateral security for obligations under the L Bonds. Importantly, DLP IV, a wholly owned subsidiary of GWG Life, owns approximately 78% of the face value of our life insurance portfolio as of December 31, 2020, and is the borrower under the LNV Credit Facility. As the borrower under the LNV Credit Facility, all of the assets of DLP IV - including all of its life insurance policy assets - serve as collateral for our obligations under the facility. DLP VI, a wholly owned subsidiary of DLP Holdings VI, which itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of GWG Life, owns the remainder of our life insurance portfolio, approximately 22% of the face value of our life insurance portfolio, as of August 31, 2021, and is the borrower under the NF Credit Facility. As the borrower under the NF Credit Facility, all of the assets of DLP VI - including all of its life insurance policy assets - serve as collateral for our obligations under the facility.\nBecause of the fact that substantially all of our life insurance policies are held in our DLP IV and DLP VI subsidiaries, and all of those life insurance assets serve as collateral security for our obligations under the LNV Credit Facility and NF Credit Facility, respectively, holders of L Bonds risk the possibility that the collateral security to secure our obligations under the L Bonds may be insufficient to repay holders upon an event of default. Furthermore, while the indenture governing the L Bonds limits the amount of debt relative to a measure of asset coverage we can incur, the indenture permits us to incur additional secured debt (subject to a debt coverage ratio) that may be senior to the L Bonds.\nFurthermore, most of the assets that secure our obligations under the L Bonds, including GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient and GWG Life\u2019s ownership interests in the holding companies that own DLP IV and DLP VI, which own substantially all of the life insurance portfolio, are illiquid assets. Although GWG Holdings and GWG Life own debt and equity securities of Beneficient, a substantial majority of the net assets of Beneficient are currently represented by goodwill, an intangible asset. The calculation of Beneficient\u2019s goodwill required the utilization of significant estimates and management judgment, as discussed elsewhere in this 2020 Form 10-K. As a result, the carrying value of those assets as reflected in our consolidated financial statements may not necessarily reflect the current market price for those assets, especially in the event of a bulk or distressed sale. Proceeds from L Bond sales will be primarily used for the repayment of L Bond maturities, interest payments and other operating expenses of GWG Holdings, and as otherwise specified in the prospectus for the L Bonds. GWG Holdings may also continue to use a portion of proceeds from L Bond sales to make investments in Beneficient. Because advances from GWG Holdings to Beneficient may be used by Beneficient for working capital purposes, such investments may not increase the tangible assets securing the L Bonds. If the trustee for the L Bonds were forced to sell all or a portion of the collateral securing them, there can be no assurance that the trustee would be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them in our consolidated financial statements, and the trustee might be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices.\nIf a significant number of holders of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds demand repayment of those instruments upon maturity instead of renewing them, and at such time we do not have sufficient capital on hand to fund those repayments (and do not otherwise have access to sufficient capital), we may be forced to liquidate some of GWG Holdings\u2019 life insurance\npolicies, GWG Holdings\u2019 or GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient or other assets, which could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, substantially all of our life insurance policies are pledged as collateral under the LNV Credit Facility and the NF Credit Facility and we would not be able to dispose of them without compliance with the terms of those credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.3 billion in principal amount of L Bonds outstanding (including Liquidity Bonds issued in connection with Beneficient\u2019s liquidity transactions, but excluding Seller Trust L Bonds). Since we first issued GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds, we have experienced $768.7 million in maturities, of which $406.3 million has renewed for an additional term, as of December 31, 2020. This has provided us with a cumulative historical renewal rate of approximately 53% for investments in GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds.\nFuture contractual maturities of L Bonds (including Liquidity Bonds issued in connection with Beneficient\u2019s liquidity transactions, but excluding Seller Trust L Bonds) as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $366.9 million in principal amount of Seller Trust L Bonds outstanding, of which $94.8 million are held by the ExAlt Trusts and are eliminated in consolidation. The Seller Trust L Bonds have a contractual maturity in August 2023; however, the holders have the ability to exercise a put to require redemption beginning in 2021. This option has not been exercised as of the date of the filing of this 2020 Form 10-K. Under that certain Supplemental Indenture (\u201cL Bond Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the Amended and Restated Indenture dated as of October 23, 2017 (the \u201cAmended and Restated Indenture\u201d), by and among GWG Holdings, GWG Life and Bank of Utah, as trustee, in the event of a redemption request, including maturity, by the holders of the Seller Trust L Bonds, GWG Holdings in its sole discretion has the ability to satisfy the principal in the form of cash, a pro rata portion of (i) the outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest under the Commercial Loan Agreement and (ii) Common Units, or a combination of cash and such property.\nThe terms of the Liquidity Bonds issued in connection with Beneficient\u2019s liquidity transactions also require payment of principal and interest in cash subject to certain exceptions, and we expect to substantially increase the principal amount of Liquidity Bonds we issue as we seek to grow our exposure to alternative assets.\nIf investors holding existing indebtedness that matures do not elect to renew their investments and we do not at such time have or have access to sufficient capital to repay the indebtedness, then we may need to liquidate some of our life insurance policies or other assets earlier than anticipated. In such an event, we may be unable to sell those policies or other assets at prices we believe are fair or otherwise appropriate and such sales could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, substantially all of our life insurance policies are pledged as collateral under the LNV Credit Facility and the NF Credit Facility and we would not be able to dispose of them without compliance with the terms of those credit facilities.\nSubordination provisions contained in the indenture governing the L Bonds, including any supplemental indentures, will restrict the ability of the trustee or the L Bond holders to enforce their rights against us under the indenture, including the right to payment on the L Bonds, if a default then exists under a senior credit facility.\nThe L Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to any claims of our senior lender under the LNV Credit Facility and NF Credit Facility. In this regard, subordination provisions limiting the right of L Bond holders to enforce their rights are contained in the indenture. These provisions include:\n\u2022a prohibition on challenging any enforcement action taken by a senior lender, or interfering with any legal action or suits undertaken by a senior lender, against us and our affiliates;\n\u2022a 180-day standstill period during which there may not be brought any action against us or our affiliates to enforce rights respecting collateral unless the LNV Credit Facility and the NF Credit Facility has been repaid in full, which period may be extended if the senior lender takes action during such standstill period; and\n\u2022a prohibition on filing a bankruptcy or insolvency case against us or our affiliates for at least one year plus one day after any senior lender has been paid in full.\nIn the event of a default on a senior credit facility, the indenture prohibits us from making any payment, direct or indirect (whether for interest, principal, as a result of any redemption or repayment at maturity, on default, or otherwise), on the L Bonds and any other indebtedness unless and until: (i) the default respecting the senior credit facility has been cured or waived or has ceased to exist; or (ii) in the case of a non-payment default that permits a senior lender to declare as due and payable all amounts owing under a senior credit facility (but where that senior lender has not yet so declared amounts as being due and payable), until the end of the period commencing on the date the trustee receives written notice of default from the senior lender and ending on the earliest of (1) our discharge of the default (or other cure), (2) the trustee\u2019s receipt of a valid waiver of default from the senior lender, or (3) a written notice from the senior lender terminating the payment prohibition.\nDuring any payment prohibition period, neither the holders of the L Bonds nor the trustee will have the right, directly or indirectly, to sue to enforce the indenture or the L Bonds. Other provisions of the indenture do permit the trustee to take action to enforce the payment rights of L Bond holders after 179 days have passed since the trustee\u2019s receipt of notice of default from a senior lender, but in such case any funds paid as a result of any such suit or enforcement action shall be applied toward the senior credit facility until the facility is indefeasibly paid in full before being applied to the L Bonds.\nThese subordination provisions present the risk that, upon any default by us on obligations owed to our senior lender, the holders of the L Bonds will be unable to enforce their rights to payment.\nIf the 180-day standstill period noted above, or any other limitation on the rights of the trustee or L Bond holders to assert their rights to payment of principal or interest under the indenture, is ultimately determined to conflict with provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (most notably sections 316(b) and 317(a) of that Act), then the trustee, as well as any holder who shall not have earlier consented to such subordination provisions, will (notwithstanding such provision contained in the indenture) be authorized to institute a lawsuit for the enforcement of any payment of principal or interest after their respective due dates.\nA failure to maintain compliance with the covenants under the LNV Credit Facility and the NF Credit Facility and the indenture governing the L Bonds may have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our business operations.\nWe are subject to various covenants under both the LNV Credit Facility and NF Credit Facility, including requirements to timely deliver financial statements to LNV Corporation (our senior lender under the LNV Credit Facility) and National Founders (the administrative agent under the NF Credit Facility). Due to our failure to deliver GWG Life audited financial statements for 2020 to LNV Corporation within 90 days after the end of the year, we were in violation of our reporting obligations. CLMG Corp., as administrative agent for LNV Corporation, issued a limited deferral extending the delivery of this report to May 17, 2021. We regained compliance on May 17, 2021, when the audited annual financial statements of GWG Life were delivered to LNV Corporation. If we fail to remain in compliance with our debt covenants, we may not be permitted to request, nor will we be entitled to receive, advances under the LNV Credit Facility, and we will not be entitled to any excess amounts received from policies pledged under the LNV Credit Facility. A failure to deliver required financial statements to LNV Corporation or National Founders in the future may result in termination of the applicable credit facility absent an extension of such period. We may be unable to repay outstanding amounts under our credit facilities unless we are able to replace it with another facility or otherwise obtain capital from other sources, in which case LNV Corporation or National Founders could elect to foreclose on the life insurance assets held in DLP IV or DLP VI, respectively, that serve as collateral security.\nUnder the indenture, including any supplemental indentures, governing the L Bonds, we are subject to various financial and non-financial covenants, including a maximum debt coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of our covenants; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with all of our financial and non-financial covenants in the future. A failure to comply with these covenants could cause us to be in default of the indenture governing the L Bonds and the indenture trustee, acting on behalf of the holders of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds, would be within its rights to accelerate the maturity dates of any amounts owed on GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds. If we were unable to repay outstanding amounts, either using current cash reserves or another source of capital, the indenture trustee would have the right, subject to the subordination provisions in the indenture, to foreclose on our assets and the assets of GWG Life (including GWG Life\u2019s equity in DLP IV and DLP Holdings VI), which serve as collateral for GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds. If\nwe are required to seek other sources of financing in order to satisfy our obligations under the LNV Credit Facility, the NF Credit Facility or GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds, such other sources of capital may be unavailable to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, failure to comply with the covenants under our debt arrangements would have a material and adverse impact on our ability to continue our business operations and may result in our investors losing all or a portion of their investment.\nThe debt coverage ratio in our indenture, designed to provide some assurance to the holders of the L Bonds that the value of our total assets exceeds our total interest-bearing obligations, values our life insurance policy assets, which represent 66% of our total assets (excluding goodwill) as of December 31, 2020, in a manner that may not be representative of the amount we would actually receive upon a sale of those assets.\nUnder the indenture governing the L Bonds, the maximum amount of L Bonds we may issue at any time, and certain other debt, is limited to an amount such that our debt coverage ratio does not exceed 90%. This limitation is designed to provide a limit on the aggregate amount of certain debt of the Company. The \u201cnet present value\u201d of our life insurance assets used in the debt coverage ratio is not the same as the GAAP \u201cfair value\u201d of those assets on our balance sheet. Accordingly, the debt coverage ratio is not necessarily indicative of the amount we and holders of L Bonds would actually receive if we were forced to sell or liquidate our life insurance related assets. Furthermore, any sale or liquidation of all or a significant portion of GWG Holdings\u2019 life insurance policies or investments in Beneficient would include significant transactional costs. As a result, our mere compliance with the debt coverage ratio in the indenture will not guarantee that the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 life insurance assets plus the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient, if sold or liquidated, would in all cases exceed the amount of GWG Holdings\u2019 obligations to the holders of L Bonds and other creditors.\nThe interest rates under our credit agreements and other agreements may be impacted by the phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d).\nLIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. LIBOR is used as a reference rate to calculate interest under certain of our borrowings and receivables. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the preferred alternative reference rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR and recommended a paced transition plan that involves the creation of a reference rate based on SOFR by the end of 2021. SOFR is a more generic measure than LIBOR and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR. Certain of our borrowing and receivable agreements contain fallback provisions providing for alternative rate calculations in the event LIBOR is unavailable, prior to any LIBOR rate transition. As a result, our level of interest payments we incur or receive may change and the new rates we incur may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out.\nWe have the discretion to purchase assets through different subsidiaries, and to transfer assets among GWG Holdings\u2019 subsidiaries. Any decision to purchase or hold title to assets in one subsidiary, as opposed to a different subsidiary, may affect the value of collateral security for our debts.\nWe may at our discretion direct GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient, purchases of additional life insurance policies, if any, and other assets by, and the sale of life insurance policies and other assets among, different subsidiaries of GWG Holdings. Purchases of assets in, or movements of assets amongst, different subsidiaries could affect the value of the collateral security for obligations under the L Bonds. For example, purchases through, or transfers of life insurance policies to, DLP IV would cause the policies acquired or transferred to become collateral for the LNV Credit Facility, and purchases through, or transfers of life insurance policies to, DLP VI would cause the policies acquired or transferred to become collateral for the NF Credit Facility, whereas purchases through, or transfers of life insurance policies to, GWG Life would cause the policies acquired by GWG Life to become collateral for the L Bonds. Accordingly, purchases of assets through, or transfers of assets to, different subsidiaries may affect the value of collateral security for different classes of holders of our debt.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nA determination that we are an unregistered investment company would have material adverse consequences.\nA determination that we are an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) would have serious adverse consequences. We do not believe we could operate our business effectively as a registered\ninvestment company. As a result, we would have to change our operations so as not to be an investment company. Changes could include refraining from raising capital, changing the types of products and services that Beneficient provides, and changing the nature of the Collateral. Furthermore, if at any time it were established that we had been operating as an investment company in violation of the registration requirements of the 1940 Act, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that such company: (i) could become subject to SEC investigation and enforcement actions, including monetary penalties and injunctive relief, (ii) would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with such company undertaken during the period in which it was established that such company was an unregistered investment company, and (iii) would face adverse action from the Texas Department of Banking, either in relation to Beneficient\u2019s pending application for a trust company charter, or if such charter is granted, in connection with such charter, the Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner, in relation to the Kansas TEFFI trust company charter. Such developments would be likely to have material and adverse consequences for us and the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient and result in a breach under our credit facilities and GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds, which would likely adversely affect our liquidity and increase our cost of capital and operational expenses. In addition, if Ben LP were treated as an investment company, it would not be eligible to be taxed as a partnership and instead would be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could result in a material and adverse impact on the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient.\nOn occasion, the SEC has attempted to regulate the purchase of non-variable universal life insurance policies as transactions in securities under federal securities laws. In July 2010, the SEC issued a Staff Report of its Life Settlement Task Force. In that report, the Staff recommended that certain types of purchased insurance policies be classified as securities. The SEC has not taken any position on the Staff Report, and there is no indication if the SEC will take any action to implement the recommendations of the Staff Report. In addition, there have been several federal court cases in which transactions involving the purchase and fractionalization of life insurance policies have been held to be transactions in securities under the federal Securities Act of 1933.\nWe believe that the matters discussed in the Staff Report and existing case law do not impact our current business model because our life insurance policies are distinguishable from those cases that have been held by courts, and advocated by the Staff Report, to be transactions in securities. For example, neither we nor any of our affiliates are involved in the fractionalization of life insurance policies, and we presently do not purchase variable life insurance policies. As a practical matter, if all or a majority of our life insurance policies were deemed to be \u201csecurities\u201d under federal securities laws, either through an expansion of the definition of what constitutes a \u201csecurity,\u201d the expansion of the types of transactions in life insurance policies that would constitute transactions in \u201csecurities,\u201d or the elimination or limitation of available exemptions and exceptions (whether by statutory change, regulatory change, or administrative or court interpretation), then we or one or more of our affiliated entities could become subject to the 1940 Act.\nBeneficient will be subject to comprehensive governmental regulation and supervision.\nBen LP and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated environment and will be subject to supervision and regulation by several governmental agencies. Ben LP and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in federal and state laws, regulations, governmental policies, tax laws and accounting principles. As Beneficient\u2019s business grows, Ben LP and its subsidiaries expect to become subject to additional regulatory agencies\u2019 regulation, including offshore insurance regulatory requirements in Bermuda and broker-dealer regulatory requirements in the United States. Changes in regulations or the regulatory environment could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business and the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient.\nBeneficient faces a risk of noncompliance with and enforcement actions under the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d). Beneficient is also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If Beneficient\u2019s policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, Beneficient will be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on Beneficient\u2019s ability to make distributions to its unitholders, including GWG, and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of Beneficient\u2019s business plan. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for\nBeneficient. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient.\nThe failure of our trust subsidiaries to maintain certain minimum amounts of capital may result in regulatory sanctions or restrictions, limitations on their respective activities and operations, or require them to raise additional capital.\nAs regulated entities, Beneficient\u2019s Kansas TEFFI and Texas trust company would be required to maintain minimum levels of capital under a framework determined by the Kansas State Banking Commissioner or Texas Banking Commissioner, as applicable. Except under certain specific and limited circumstances, in the event that Beneficient\u2019s Texas trust company failed to maintain at least such minimum capital amount, it would be unable to pay dividends to Beneficient or engage in capital repurchases, which could impair its ability to provide liquidity to Beneficient. In addition, the failure of Beneficient\u2019s trust companies to maintain minimum required levels of capital could subject them to administrative action, which could include restrictive constraints on operations, management, and activities, monetary sanctions, orders to raise additional capital, or, under certain limited circumstances, in the commencement of receivership or conservatorship proceedings. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on Beneficient\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or prospects, which could affect the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient.\nIf a subsidiary of Ben LP receives a trust company charter in Texas or an unconditional TEFFI charter in Kansas, the Texas Banking Commissioner or the Kansas State Banking Commissioner, as applicable, would have the authority to increase the minimum amount of capital required to be maintained by such subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which may result in lower returns on equity.\nThe Texas Banking Commissioner has the authority to increase the minimum amount of capital required to be maintained by a Texas trust company, under a framework set forth in the Texas Finance Code, if the Commissioner finds that the condition and operations of the Company require additional capital to promote the safety and soundness of the trust company. Factors to be considered include the nature and type of business in which the trust company engages, the nature and decree of liquidity in trust company assets, the amount and type of fiduciary assets managed by the trust company, the complexity of the business, the adequacy of insurance held by the trust company and the extent and adequacy of its internal controls, among other things.\nThe Kansas State Banking Commissioner does not have the same discretionary authority under the TEFFI Act to increase a TEFFI\u2019s minimum capital so long as: (i) the TEFFI does not accept deposits, other than alternative asset custody accounts; (ii) the TEFFI maintains no third-party debt except debts owed to its members or its affiliates; and (iii) the TEFFI has secured an agreement from its members whereby such members agree to contribute additional capital to the TEFFI on if needed to ensure the safety and soundness of the fiduciary financial institution. However, if those requirements are not satisfied, the Kansas State Banking Commissioner may have the authority to require the TEFFI to maintain additional capital.\nAny increase in the minimum amount of capital required for Beneficient\u2019s Kansas TEFFI or Texas trust company will further limit its ability to direct the allocation of those capital resources in the most optimal manner, including through cash distributions to Beneficient. In addition, a requirement to maintain higher minimum levels of capital at those entities may result in lower returns on equity, which could affect the value of GWG Holdings\u2019 and GWG Life\u2019s investments in Beneficient.\nBeneficient may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation, including claims or litigation relating to its fiduciary responsibilities.\nBeneficient\u2019s business involves the risk that customers or others may sue Beneficient, claiming that Beneficient has failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them. This risk would be heightened when Beneficient\u2019s trust company begins serving as a fiduciary for its customers if the Texas state trust company charter is issued or when the Kansas TEFFI charter becomes unconditional. Specifically, Beneficient\u2019s trust company would be required to (i) adhere to the fiduciary standard of care required under the terms of the governing documents or applicable law, and (ii) properly discharge its fiduciary duties. If Beneficient fails to comply with these fiduciary obligations, it could incur significant costs and possibly liability, which could materially and adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Liability for breach of fiduciary duty may be difficult to assess or quantify and its existence and magnitude may remain unknown for a substantial period of time. Additionally, an alleged breach of fiduciary duty, regardless of the merits of such alleged breach, could significantly damage Beneficient\u2019s reputation and cause it to incur legal and other costs. Claims made or actions brought against Beneficient, whether founded or unfounded, may result in injunctions, settlements, damages, fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on Beneficient\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s ability to raise additional funding or attract new customers, and could require changes to Beneficient\u2019s business. Even if Beneficient defends itself successfully, the cost of litigation is often\nsubstantial, and public reports regarding claims made against Beneficient may cause damage to its reputation among existing and prospective customers or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies, and equity holders, consequently affecting Beneficient\u2019s earnings negatively.\nA change in Beneficient\u2019s tax treatment could adversely affect Beneficient.\nBeneficient is subject to a variety of tax laws and tax regulations by national, regional and local governments and its Ben Insurance subsidiary, Pen, will be subject to foreign tax laws and tax regulations. Ben LP, and most of its subsidiaries, are pass through entities that are generally not subject to taxation. Rather, Beneficient passes on the distributive share of income to its investors who bear the burden of any tax liability that may be generated by such income. These tax laws and regulations (including the applicable tax rates), and their interpretation and application, may change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or Beneficient\u2019s financial position.\nIn addition, without the consent of Ben LP\u2019s unitholders, Ben LP\u2019s general partner may elect to convert Ben LP into a corporation or be taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if certain conditions have been met. Such a conversion could be a taxable event to Ben LP\u2019s unitholders where gain or loss is recognized. In addition, a conversion would subject all of Ben LP\u2019s future net income to a level of corporate tax, which may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution or reinvestment.\nOur life insurance business is subject to state regulation and changes in those laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation, could negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nWhen we purchase a life insurance policy, we are subject to state insurance regulations. Over the past number of years, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of states that have adopted legislation and regulations from model laws promulgated by either the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) or by the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL). These laws are essentially consumer protection statutes responding to abuses that arose early in the development of the industry, some of which may persist. Today, almost every state has adopted some version of either the NAIC or NCOIL model laws, which generally require the licensing of purchasers of and brokers for life insurance policies, the filing and approval of purchase agreements, and the disclosure of transaction fees. These laws also require various periodic reporting requirements and prohibit certain business practices deemed to be abusive. State statutes typically provide state regulatory agencies with significant powers to interpret, administer, and enforce the laws relating to the purchase of life insurance policies. Under statutory authority, state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing requirements, interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in different ways, or issue new administrative rules, any of which could be generally adverse to the industry and potentially the value of our life insurance policy assets.\nWe may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations.\nWe may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations and be held accountable for such violations, even if such violations are inadvertent. Some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance in place at the time. For example, Beneficient is subject to regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or \u201cOFAC,\u201d that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities.\nOn April 1, 2021, we filed with the SEC a Notification of Late Filing pursuant to Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 indicating that we were unable to complete our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 within the time period required to timely file this 2020 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. We indicated at the time that we expected to file this Report no later than April 15, 2021, which is the fifteenth calendar day filing extension period afforded registrants under Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of April 15, 2020, however, we remained unable to file this Report. As such, we temporarily suspended the offering of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds, commencing April 16, 2021, as a result of our delay in filing this annual report with the SEC. Additionally, we were unable to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, which was due on or before May 17, 2021, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, which was due on or before August 17, 2021.\nAs part of the preparation of this 2020 Form 10-K, the Company voluntarily submitted two questions to the SEC's OCA on February 15, 2021. OCA is responsible for accounting and auditing matters arising in the SEC\u2019s administration of the federal securities laws, particularly with respect to accounting policy determinations. The questions submitted by the Company to OCA were (1) whether the December 31, 2019 transaction resulted in GWG Holdings obtaining control of Ben LP in a transaction by entities not under common control, and (2) whether Ben LP was required to consolidate any of the ExAlt Trusts. On July 26, 2021, the Company and OCA staff held a conference call in which OCA\u2019s staff notified the Company of its conclusions on the two accounting questions that were the subject of the consultation. During that call, OCA expressed that it would object to a conclusion that Ben LP not consolidate the ExAlt Trusts as of December 31, 2019. Consistent with the conclusions communicated by OCA, on August 1, 2021, the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings determined that it is necessary to restate prior period financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, and quarterly financial statements for the first three quarters of the year ended December 31, 2020, to consolidate the ExAlt Trusts into Beneficient\u2019s financial statements beginning on December 31, 2019, and consequently into the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements on that same date.\nWe anticipate recommencing the offering of GWG Holdings\u2019 L Bonds when we regain compliance with SEC filing requirements. To regain compliance, we must (i) prepare and file all applicable late filings, including this 2020 Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2021, by October 31, 2021, and (ii) hold an annual shareholder meeting by December 31, 2021. If GWG Holdings is unable to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s filing requirements for continued listing, we expect GWG Holdings to be delisted, in which case our business and the value of our securities would likely be materially and adversely impacted. While we have not filed the filings required by October 31, 2021, as of the date of this filings, we have communicated with Nasdaq regarding the status of the filings and have not yet received notice from Nasdaq regarding delisting.\nWe face risks from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions.\nFrom time to time, we may be named as a defendant or otherwise become involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Future actions against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to us.\nBeneficient\u2019s businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject Beneficient to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Beneficient to be required to restructure its operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing Beneficient\u2019s profitability.\nWhile we seek to insure against potential risks, we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover certain risks, or obtain coverage on favorable terms, and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover certain civil or criminal proceedings or regulatory investigations and associated costs.\nWe are currently subject to a non-public, fact-finding investigation into GWG Holdings by the SEC, and we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter.\nOn October 6, 2020, GWG Holdings received a subpoena to produce documents from the Chicago office of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, informing the Company of the existence of a non-public, fact-finding investigation into GWG Holdings. Since the initial subpoena, the Company has received subsequent subpoenas from the SEC for additional information. The requested information from the SEC has primarily related to GWG Holdings\u2019 investment products, including its L Bonds, as well as various accounting matters, among them, the consolidation for financial reporting purposes of Beneficient by GWG Holdings, goodwill valuation, and the accounting related to the ExAlt Trusts, related party transactions, life insurance policies, and the calculation of the debt-coverage ratio. We are cooperating fully with the SEC in connection with its investigation. Investigations of this nature are inherently uncertain, and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, the SEC investigation may have an adverse impact on us because of fines, legal costs, other expenses, diversion of management resources, and other factors. The investigation could also result in reputational harm to the Company and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s current and future business activities and its ability to\nraise capital through the sale of L Bonds and equity securities. As a result, the failure to raise enough capital to meet our cash needs could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the value of our securities.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur success depends on certain key executives and the ability to attract, retain, and develop new professionals.\nOur success depends in large part upon the skills, experience, personal reputations and network of business contacts of certain key executives. These individuals\u2019 reputations, business relationships and expertise are critical elements in the successful implementation of our business strategy. Accordingly, the loss of any of the key executives could materially harm our business.\nOur key executives are directly responsible for setting our strategic direction, operating our business, maintaining and expanding business and other critical relationships, clients and business partners and identifying expansion opportunities. Should we lose one of these key executives, we may have to search externally for a qualified replacement, which search may be prolonged, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to hire such a replacement on a timely basis or at all.\nMost of our employees are employed by Beneficient, who provide services to GWG Holdings pursuant to the terms and conditions of an administrative shared services agreement, by and between GWG Holdings and Ben LP (the \u201cShared Services Agreement\u201d). GWG Holdings and Ben LP have entered into a non-binding term sheet under which GWG Holdings would lose its ability to appoint a majority of the board of directors of the general partner of Ben LP and control the activities of Beneficient. If GWG Holdings is no longer able to control the activities of Beneficient, GWG Holdings will be relying on contractual obligations, including those under the Shared Services Agreement, to meet its human capital needs.\nAdditionally, competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense. Thus, the loss of any of these key personnel, by resignation, termination, death or disability, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified replacements, could cause disruption in our business and could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy, which could materially and adversely affect our business, growth and profitability.\nOur business faces substantial competition from a variety of financial solution companies and other liquidity providers to owners of alternative assets.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of competitors, many of which are larger, have an established track record and reputation, and may have more financial resources. Our business competes with other providers of financial and trust administration such as bank holding companies, commercial and savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, asset managers and their private equity affiliates, insurance companies and a growing list of other local, regional and national institutions that offer financial and trust administration services. Our business also competes with other providers of liquidity for alternative assets, which may hinder our ability to offer liquidity transactions to the market. If we are unable to compete effectively, we will not be able to grow our exposure to alternative assets and our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. While we believe regulatory approval to operate certain of our subsidiaries as a Texas trust company, Kansas TEFFI trust company and Bermuda Class 3 insurer will give us competitive advantages, any such advantages are not certain and we may never receive such approvals.\nOur results of operations likely will fluctuate from period to period, which may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nWe expect that the results of our operations will vary significantly from period to period for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict, including demand for Beneficient\u2019s liquidity products and trust administration services, changes in the fair value of the alternative assets held by certain of the ExAlt Trusts, performance of the ExAlt Loans against alternative assets interests underlying the Collateral and concentration of risk in the loan portfolios, and the performance of our life insurance portfolio. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance and such fluctuations may make it harder for us to market and sell our securities or otherwise obtain necessary financing to maintain and grow our business.\nBusiness disruptions and interruptions and adverse economic conditions due to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations can be subject to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control, such as the effects of earthquakes, fires, floods, severe weather, public health issues such as the outbreak of the coronavirus or other pandemic diseases, power failures, telecommunication loss, major accidents, terrorist attacks, acts of war, and other natural and man-made events, some of which may be intensified by the effects of a government response to the event or climate change and\nchanging weather patterns. For example, our corporate headquarters and critical business offices are located in north Texas, which is geographically located in \u201ctornado alley\u201d, an area known for high instances of tornadoes, and which recently experienced catastrophic tornadic activity and blackouts. A tornado or other disaster could cause severe destruction, disruption or interruption to our operations or property and significantly impact our employees.\nAlthough we have implemented a business continuity management program that we continue to enhance on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that the program will adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions. Additionally, natural disasters and external events, including those occurring in and around Texas, could affect the business and operations of our clients, which could impair their ability to satisfy obligations to us, impair the value of underlying collateral or otherwise adversely affect their business dealings with us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in general economic conditions could adversely impact our business.\nChanges in general economic conditions, including, for example, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, short term funding markets, investor sentiment, changes specifically affecting competition, technological developments, political and diplomatic events, tax laws, and other factors, can substantially and adversely affect our business and prospects. For example, an increase in interest rates would increase our cost of capital and may limit our ability to raise capital and have a corresponding adverse impact on our operating results. The financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry are highly volatile and are affected by, among other factors, domestic and foreign economic conditions, geopolitics and general trends in business and finance, all of which are beyond our control. While we have engaged and may continue to engage in certain hedging activities to mitigate the impact of fluctuating interest rates and foreign exchange rates, none of these risks are or will be within our control. Declines in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in a corresponding decline in Beneficient\u2019s performance and may adversely affect the assets comprising the Collateral and the ExAlt Loans against the assets comprising the Collateral.\nA failure in our operational systems as well as human error or malfeasance, including cyber-attacks, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and cause losses.\nOur financial, accounting, data processing or other operational systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. We must continuously update systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets, and invest in systemic controls and training to ensure that such transactions do not violate applicable rules and regulations or, due to errors in processing such transactions, adversely affect markets, our clients or us. Enhancements and updates to systems, as well as the requisite training, including in connection with the integration of new businesses, entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.\nThe use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by our employees and the operation of our systems and business and those of our clients and its third-party service providers and vendors. Additionally, computing devices may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or have other inherent weaknesses.\nCybersecurity attacks and security breaches of our technology systems, and those of our clients and third-party vendors, may subject us to liability and harm our business operations and overall reputation. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents continue to grow, and there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies and other organizations reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information in recent years. Cybersecurity risks could disrupt our operations, negatively impact our ability to compete and result in injury to our reputation, result in system downtime and loss of revenue, and increase costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. Our security measures, information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil or criminal litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties upon whom we rely face similar threats, which could directly or indirectly impact our business and operations. The occurrence of a cybersecurity-incident or attack on our third-party vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based risk and control systems, our business relies on individuals that may make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures that are not always identified immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures. These errors or violations can include calculation errors, mistakes in addressing emails, errors in software or model development or implementation, or errors in judgment, as well as intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures. Human errors and malfeasance, even if promptly discovered and remediated, can result in material losses and liabilities for us.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party vendors provide and are expected to continue to provide key components of our business infrastructure. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients, impair our ability to conduct our business efficiently and effectively, and/or result in regulatory action, financial loss, litigation, and loss of reputation. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.", "PERMNO": 14930, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "GWGH"}
