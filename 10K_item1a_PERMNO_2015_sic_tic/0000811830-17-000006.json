{"cik": "811830", "company": "Santander Holdings USA, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks potentially impacting its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in transactions and are present in the business decisions made by the Company. Accordingly, the Company encounters risk as part of the normal course of its business, and risk management processes are designed to help manage these risks.\nRisk management is an important part of the Company's business model. The success of the business is dependent on management's ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by business activities so that management can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. These risks include credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, compliance and legal risk, and strategic and reputation risk. We discuss our principal risk management processes in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.\nThe following are the most significant risk factors that affect the Company. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, in addition to presenting other possible adverse consequences, which are described below. These risk factors and other risks are also discussed further in other sections of this Report.\nMacro-Economic and Political Risks\nGiven that our loan portfolios are concentrated in the United States, adverse changes affecting the economy of the United States could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur loan portfolios are concentrated in the United States. Accordingly, the recoverability of our loan portfolios and our ability to increase the amount of loans outstanding and our results of operations and financial condition in general are dependent to a significant extent on the level of economic activity in the United States. A return to recessionary conditions in the United States economy would likely have a significant adverse impact on our loan portfolios and, as a result, on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets.\nGlobal economic conditions deteriorated significantly between 2007 and 2009, and the United States fell into recession. Many major financial institutions, including some of the country's largest commercial banks, investment banks, mortgage lenders, mortgage guarantors and insurance companies, including us, experienced significant difficulties.\nWe face, among others, the following risks in the event of an economic downturn:\n\u2022\nIncreased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation has increased and will continue to increase our costs and may affect the pricing for our products and services and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\u2022\nReduced demand for our products and services.\n\u2022\nInability of our borrowers to timely or fully comply with their existing obligations.\n\u2022\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\n\u2022\nThe degree of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates, which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process and the sufficiency of our loan and lease loss allowances.\n\u2022\nThe value and liquidity of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nAny worsening of economic conditions may delay the recovery of the financial industry and impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nMacroeconomic shocks may impact the household income of our retail customers negatively and adversely affect the recoverability of our retail loans, resulting in increased loan and lease losses.\nDespite recent improvements in certain segments of the economy, some uncertainty remains concerning the future economic environment. There can be no assurance that economic conditions in these segments will continue to improve. Such economic uncertainty could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. A slowing or failing of the economic recovery would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult economic and market conditions on us and on others in the financial services industry.\nIn addition, the global recession and disruption of the financial markets led to concerns over the solvency of certain European countries, affecting those countries\u2019 capital markets access and in some cases sovereign credit ratings, as well as market perception of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to these countries. These concerns continue even as the global economy is recovering, and some previously stressed European economies have experienced at least partial recoveries from their low points during the recession. If measures to address sovereign debt and financial sector problems in Europe are inadequate, they may delay or weaken economic recovery, or result in the further exit of member states from the Eurozone or more severe economic and financial conditions. If realized, these risk scenarios could contribute to severe financial market stress or a global recession, likely affecting the economy and capital markets in the United States as well.\nIncreased disruption and volatility in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on us, including our ability to access capital and liquidity on financial terms acceptable to us, if at all. If capital markets financing ceases to become available, or becomes excessively expensive, we may be forced to raise the rates we pay on deposits to attract more customers and become unable to maintain certain liability maturities. Any such increase in capital markets funding availability or costs or in deposit rates could have a material adverse effect on our interest margins and liquidity.\nIf some or all of the foregoing risks were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur growth, asset quality and profitability may be adversely affected by volatile macroeconomic and political conditions.\nThe United States economy has experienced volatility recently, characterized by slow or regressive growth. This volatility resulted in fluctuations in the levels of deposits and in the relative economic strength of various segments of the economy to which we lend.\nNegative and fluctuating economic conditions, such as a changing interest rate environment, impact our profitability by causing lending margins to decrease and leading to decreased demand for higher margin products and services. Negative and fluctuating economic conditions could also result in government defaults on public debt. This could affect us in two ways: directly, through portfolio losses, and indirectly, through instabilities that a default in public debt could cause to the banking system as a whole, particularly since commercial banks' exposure to government debt is high in certain Latin American and European regions or countries.\nIn addition, our revenues are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, social instability, and changes in governmental policies, international ownership legislation, interest-rate caps and tax policies.\nGrowth, asset quality and profitability may be affected by volatile macroeconomic and political conditions.\nThe results of the recent U.S. presidential election could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIt is unclear what impact, if any, the recent change in the U.S. presidential administration will have on the laws, regulations and policies affecting the supervision of banking organizations. Among other things, the Trump administration and certain members of Congress have indicated that significant U.S. tax reform is a top legislative priority. A number of tax reform proposals, including significant changes to croporate tax provisions, are currently under consideration. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our deferred tax assets and liabilities, depending on the nature and extent of any changes that are ultimately enacted into law. There is substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood, timing and details of any such tax reform, and therefore no assurance can be given as to whether or to what extent any changes to the U.S. tax laws will impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nDevelopments stemming from the U.K.\u2019s referendum on membership in the EU could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe result of the United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cUK\u2019s\u201d) referendum on whether to remain part of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) has had and may continue to have negative effects on global economic conditions and global financial markets. On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum on whether it should remain part of the EU, the outcome of which was a vote in favor of withdrawing from the EU. The results of that referendum and the UK's implementation of it means that the UK's EU membership will cease. The long-term nature of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU is unclear (including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the UK determines which EU laws to replicate or replace), and there is considerable uncertainty as to when the framework for any such relationship governing both the access of the UK to European markets and the access of EU member states to the UK\u2019s markets will be determined and implemented. The result of the referendum has created an uncertain political and economic environment in the UK, and may create such environments in other EU member states. Political and economic uncertainty has in the past led to declines in market liquidity and activity levels, volatile market conditions, a contraction of available credit, lower or negative interest rates, weaker economic growth and reduced business confidence, each of which could adversely affect our business. As a result of the referendum and its implementation, certain of our affiliates may face additional operational, regulatory and compliance costs.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe are subject to substantial regulation which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nAs a financial institution, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, which materially affects our businesses. The statutes, regulations, and policies to which the Company is subject may change at any time. In addition, the interpretation and application by regulators of the laws and regulations to which the Company is subject may change from time to time. Extensive legislation affecting the financial services industry has recently been adopted in the United States, and regulations have been and are in the process of being implemented. The manner in which those laws and related regulations are applied to the operations of financial institutions is still evolving. Any legislative or regulatory actions and any required changes to our business operations resulting from such legislation and regulations could result in significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in which we might otherwise consider engaging and provide certain products and services, affect the value of assets we hold, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance and other costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that future changes in regulations or in their interpretation or application will not affect us adversely.\nRegulation of the Company as a BHC includes limitations on permissible activities. Moreover, as described below, the Company and the Bank are required to perform stress tests and submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve and the OCC on an annual basis, and receive a notice of non-objection to the plans from the Federal Reserve and the OCC before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties and enforcement actions for violations we may commit, and has the authority to disallow acquisitions we or our subsidiaries may contemplate, which may limit our future growth plans. Such constraints currently applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries and/or regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOther regulations which significantly affect the Company, or which could significantly affect the Company in the future, relate to capital requirements, liquidity and funding, taxation of the financial sector, and development of regulatory reforms in the United States, and are discussed in further detail below.\nIn addition, the volume, granularity, frequency and scale of regulatory and other reporting requirements necessitate a clear data strategy to enable consistent data aggregation, reporting and management. Inadequate management information systems or processes, including those relating to risk data aggregation and risk reporting, could lead to a failure to meet regulatory reporting requirements or other internal or external information demands that may result in supervisory measures.\nSignificant Global Regulation\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on comprehensive changes to the capital adequacy framework, known as Basel III. A revised version of Basel III was published in June 2011. Basel III is intended to raise the resilience of the banking sector by increasing both the quality and quantity of the regulatory capital base and enhancing the risk coverage of the capital framework. The changes in Basel III are being phased in gradually between January 2015 and January 2019.\nThere can be no assurance that the implementation of these new standards will not adversely affect the Company's or its subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or require it to issue additional securities that qualify as regulatory capital, liquidate assets, curtail business or take any other actions, any of which may have adverse effects on the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations. Furthermore, increased capital requirements may negatively affect the Company's return on equity and other financial performance indicators.\nEffective management of our capital position is important to our ability to operate our business, continue to grow organically, and pursue our business strategy. However, in response to the global financial crisis, a number of changes to the regulatory capital framework have been adopted or continue to be considered. As these and other changes are implemented or future changes are considered or adopted that limit our ability to manage our balance sheet and capital resources effectively or access funding on commercially acceptable terms, we may experience a material adverse effect on our financial condition and regulatory capital position.\nIn addition to the changes to the capital adequacy framework described above, the Basel Committee also published its global quantitative liquidity framework, comprising the LCR and NSFR metrics, with objectives to (1) promote the short-term resilience of banks\u2019 liquidity risk profiles by ensuring they have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive a significant stress scenario; and (2) promote resilience over a longer time horizon by creating incentives for banks to fund their activities with more stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis. The LCR was subsequently revised by the Basel Committee in January 2013 and includes a revised timetable for phase-in of the standard from 2015 to 2019, as well as some technical changes to some of the stress scenario assumptions. In January 2014, the Basel Committee published amendments to the leverage ratio and technical revisions to the NSFR, confirming that it remains its intention that the latter ratio, including any future revisions, will become a minimum standard by January 1, 2018. In January 2014, the Basel Committee proposed uniform disclosure standards related to the LCR and issued a new modification to the ratio.\nSignificant United States Regulation\nFrom time to time, we are or may become involved in formal and informal reviews, investigations, examinations, proceedings, and information gathering requests by federal and state government agencies, including, among others, the FRB, the CFPB, the DOJ, the SEC, the Federal Trade Commission and various state regulatory and enforcement agencies.\nThe DFA, which was adopted in 2010, will continue to result in significant structural reforms affecting the financial services industry. This legislation provided for, among other things, the establishment of the CFPB with broad authority to regulate the credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services that we offer, the creation of a structure to regulate systemically important financial companies, more comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, prohibitions on engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, restrictions on ownership of, investment in or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds, restrictions on interchange fees earned through debit card transactions, and a requirement that bank regulators phase out the treatment of trust preferred capital instruments as Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes.\nThe DFA provides for an extensive framework for the regulation of over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives, including mandatory clearing, exchange trading and transaction reporting of certain OTC derivatives. Entities that are swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants or major security-based swap participants are required to register with the SEC or the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \"CFTC\"), or both, and are or will be subject to new capital, margin, business conduct, record-keeping, clearing, execution, reporting and other requirements. We may register as a swap dealer with the CFTC.\nIn July 2013, United States bank regulators issued the United States Basel III final rules implementing the Basel III capital framework for United States banks and BHCs. Certain aspects of the United States Basel III final rules, such as new minimum capital ratios and a revised methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets, became effective on January 1, 2015. Other aspects of the United States Basel III final rules, such as the capital conservation buffer and the new regulatory deductions from and adjustments to capital, began to be phased in over several years on January 1, 2015.\nIn addition, in October 2014, the Federal Reserve and other United States regulators issued a final rule introducing a quantitative LCR requirement on certain large banks and BHCs. The LCR is broadly consistent with the Basel Committee\u2019s revised Basel III liquidity rules, but is more stringent in several important respects. The Federal Reserve has stated that it intends through future rule-makings to apply the Basel III LCR and NSFR to the United States operations of some or all large FBOs.\nIn February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued the Final Rule to enhance its supervision and regulation of certain FBOs. Among other things, this rule required FBOs, such as the Company, with over $50 billion of United States non-branch assets to establish or designate a United States IHC and to transfer its entire ownership interest in substantially all of its United States subsidiaries to that IHC by July 1, 2016. United States branches and agencies were not required to be transferred to the IHC. As a result of this rule, Santander transferred substantially all of its equity interests in its U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries previously outside the Company to the Company, which became an IHC effective July 1, 2016. These subsidiaries included Santander BanCorp, BSI, SIS and SSLLC, as well as several other subsidiaries. The entities transferred approximately $14.1 billion of assets and approximately $11.8 billion of liabilities to the Company on July 1, 2016. The IHC is subject to an enhanced supervision framework, including enhanced risk-based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity requirements, risk/management requirements, and stress-testing requirements. A phased-in approach is being used for those standards and requirements. SHUSA's status as an IHC will require it to invest significant management attention and resources.\nWithin the DFA, the Volcker Rule prohibits \u201cbanking entities\u201d from engaging in certain forms of proprietary trading or from sponsoring or investing in covered funds, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule also limits the ability of banking entities and their affiliates to enter into certain transactions with such funds with which they or their affiliates have certain relationships. The Volcker Rule became effective in July 2012 and, in December 2013, United States regulators issued final rules implementing the Volcker Rule. The final rules contain exclusions and certain exemptions for market-making, hedging, underwriting, and trading in United States government and agency obligations as well as certain foreign government obligations, and trading solely outside the United States, and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of funds to be retained. In December 2014, the Federal Reserve issued an order requiring all banking entities to conform to the Volcker Rule and implement a compliance program by July 21, 2016. The Company adopted the necessary measures to our activities and was in compliance with the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2016.\nFurthermore, Title I of the DFA and the implementing regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC require each BHC with assets of $50 billion or more, including Santander, to prepare and submit a plan for the orderly resolution of our subsidiaries and operations domiciled in the United States in the event of future material financial distress or failure. The plan must include information on resolution strategy, major counterparties, and interdependencies, among other things, and requires substantial effort, time, and cost to prepare. Santander submitted its most recent United States resolution plan in December 2015. The United States resolution plan is subject to review by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.\nIn December 2016, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule on TLAC, LTD, and clean holding company requirements for systemically important U.S. BHCs and IHCs of systemically important FBOs. Covered institutions must be in compliance with this rule by January 1, 2019 and SHUSA, as the IHC for Santander in the U.S., will be subject to these requirements. The TLAC requirement will create material additional quantitative requirements for the Company, including new minimum risk-based and leverage TLAC ratios of (i) the Company's regulatory capital plus certain types of long-term unsecured debt instruments and other eligible liabilities that can be written down or converted into equity during resolution to (ii) the Company's RWA and the Basel III leverage ratio denominator.\nOn November 4, 2015, SC entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance (\"AOD\") with the Office of Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the \"Massachusetts AG\"). The Massachusetts AG had alleged that SC violated the maximum permissible interest rates allowed by Massachusetts law due to the inclusion of guaranteed auto protection (\"GAP\") charges in the calculation of finance charges. Among other things, the AOD requires SC, with respect to any loan that exceeded maximum rates, to issue refunds of all finance charges paid to date and to waive all future finance charges. The AOD also requires SC to undertake certain remedial measures, including ensuring that the interest rates on its loans do not exceed maximum rates (when GAP charges are included) in the future, and provides that SC pay $150 thousand to the Massachusetts AG to reimburse its costs in implementing the AOD.\nOn February 25, 2015, SC entered into a consent order with the DOJ, approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, that resolves the DOJ\u2019s claims against the Company that certain of its repossession and collection activities during the period of time between January 2008 and February 2013 violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). The consent order requires us to pay a civil fine in the amount of $55,000, as well as at least $9.4 million to affected servicemembers, consisting of $10,000 per servicemember plus compensation for any lost equity (with interest) for each repossession by us and $5,000 per servicemember for each instance where we sought to collect repossession-related fees on accounts where a repossession was conducted by a prior account holder. The consent order also requires us to undertake additional remedial measures. The consent order also subjects us to monitoring by the DOJ for compliance with SCRA for a period of five years.\nOn July 31, 2015, the CFPB notified SC that it had referred to the Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") certain alleged violations by SC of the ECOA regarding (i) statistical disparities in mark-ups charged by automobile dealers to protected groups on loans originated by those dealers and purchased by SC and (ii) the treatment of certain types of income in SC's underwriting process. On September 25, 2015, the DOJ notified SC that it had initiated an investigation under the ECOA of SC's pricing of automobile loans based on the referral from the CFPB.\nEach of these aspects of the DFA, as well as other changes in United States banking regulations, may directly and indirectly impact various aspects of our business. The full spectrum of risks that the DFA, including the Volcker Rule, poses to us is not yet known. However, such risks could be material and could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur resolution in a bankruptcy proceeding could result in losses for holders of our debt and equity securities.\nUnder regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and as required by Section 165(d) of the DFA, we must provide to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan (a \u201cSection 165(d) Resolution Plan\u201d) for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress affecting the Company or the failure of the Company. The purpose of this provision of the DFA is to provide regulators with plans that would enable them to resolve failing financial companies that pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the United States in a manner that mitigates such risk. The most recently filed Section 165(d) Resolution Plan by Santander, dated December 16, 2015 (the \u201c2015 Resolution Plan\u201d) provides a roadmap for the orderly resolution of the material U.S. operations of Santander under hypothetical stress scenarios and the failure of one or more of its U.S. material entities (\u201cU.S. MEs\u201d). Material entities are defined as subsidiaries or foreign offices of Santander that are significant to the activities of a critical operation or core business line. The U.S. MEs identified in the 2015 Resolution Plan include, among other entities, the Company, the Bank and SC.\nThe 2015 Resolution Plan describes a strategy for resolving Santander\u2019s U.S. operations, including its U.S. MEs and the core business lines that operate within those U.S. MEs, in a manner that would substantially mitigate the risk that the resolutions would have serious adverse effects on U.S. or global financial stability. Under the 2015 Resolution Plan\u2019s hypothetical resolutions of the U.S. MEs, the Bank would be placed into FDIC receivership and the Company and SC would be placed into bankruptcy under Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, respectively.\nThe strategy described in the 2015 Resolution Plan contemplates a \u201cmultiple point of entry\u201d strategy, in which Santander and the Company would each undergo separate resolution proceedings under the laws of Spain and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, respectively. In a scenario where the Bank and SC were in resolution, the Company would file a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and holders of our LTD and other debt securities would be junior to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Company.\nThe Company, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC are not obligated to follow the Company\u2019s preferred resolution strategy for resolving its U.S. operations under its resolution plan. In addition, Santander could in the future change its resolution strategy for resolving its U.S. operations. In an alternative scenario, the Company alone could enter bankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and the Company\u2019s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed, using assets of the Company, so that they could continue normal operations as going concerns or subsequently be wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the losses incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries would be imposed first on the holders of the Company\u2019s equity securities and thereafter on unsecured creditors, including holders of our LTD and other debt securities. Holders of our LTD and other debt securities would be junior to the claims of creditors of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Company. Under either of these scenarios, in a resolution of the Company under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, holders of our LTD and other debt securities would realize value only to the extent available to the Company as a shareholder of the Bank, SC and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Company have been fully repaid.\nIn December 2016, the Federal Reserve finalized rules requiring intermediate holding companies of foreign G-SIBs, including the Company, to maintain minimum amounts of LTD and TLAC. It is possible that the Company\u2019s resolution strategy in connection with the implementation of those rules, which will become effective on January 1, 2019, could change on or before that date. Further, even if Santander\u2019s and the Company\u2019s strategy for resolving its U.S. operations does not change, it is possible that the Federal Reserve or the FDIC could choose not to follow the current strategy.\nThe resolution of the Company under the orderly liquidation authority could result in greater losses for holders of our equity and debt securities.\nThe ability of holders of our LTD and other debt securities to recover the full amount that would otherwise be payable on those securities in a resolution proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code may be impaired by the exercise of the FDIC\u2019s powers under the \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d under Title II of the DFA.\nTitle II of the DFA created a new resolution regime known as the \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d to which financial companies, including U.S. intermediate holding companies of FBOs with assets of $50 billion or more, such as the Company, can be subjected. Under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver in order to liquidate a financial company if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the United States Secretary of the Treasury determines that the entity is in severe financial distress, the entity\u2019s failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and resolution under the orderly liquidation authority would avoid or mitigate those effects, among other things. Absent such determinations, the Company would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority, then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have transacted with the Company. There are substantial differences between the rights available to creditors under the orderly liquidation authority and under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For example, under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC may disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances (which would otherwise be respected under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code), and an administrative claims procedures is used to determine creditors\u2019 claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings). Under the orderly liquidation authority, in certain circumstances, the FDIC could elevate the priority of claims if it determines that doing so is necessary to facilitate a smooth and orderly liquidation without the need to obtain the consent of other creditors or prior court review. Furthermore, the FDIC has the right to transfer assets or liabilities of the failed company to a third party or \u201cbridge\u201d entity under the orderly liquidation authority.\nRegardless of what resolution strategy Santander might prefer for resolving its U.S. operations, the FDIC could determine that it is a desirable strategy to resolve the Company in a manner that would, among other things, impose losses on the Company\u2019s shareholder, unsecured debt holders (including holders of LTD) and other creditors, while permitting the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to continue to operate. It is likely that the application of such an entry strategy in which the Company would be the only legal entity in the U.S. to enter resolution proceedings would result in greater losses to holders of our LTD and other debt securities than the losses that would result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy for the Company. Assuming the Company entered resolution proceedings and support from the Company to its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level could be transferred to the Company and ultimately borne by the Company\u2019s security holders (including holders of our LTD and other debt securities), with the result that third-party creditors of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while the Company\u2019s security holders (including holders of our LTD) and other unsecured creditors could face significant losses. In addition, in a resolution under the orderly liquidation authority, holders of our LTD and other debt securities of the Company could face losses ahead of our other similarly situated creditors if the FDIC exercised its right, described above, to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims.\nThe orderly liquidation authority also requires that creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership must bear all losses before taxpayers are exposed to any losses, and amounts owed by the financial company or the receivership to the U.S. government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private creditors, including holders of our LTD and other debt securities. In addition, under the orderly liquidation authority, claims of creditors (including holders of our LTD and other debt securities) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which the Company\u2019s assets are transferred, as described above. If securities were to be delivered in satisfaction of claims, there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged.\nAlthough the FDIC has issued regulations to implement the orderly liquidation authority, not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known, and additional rulemaking is possible.\nUnited States stress testing, capital planning, and related supervisory actions\nThe Company is subject to stress testing and capital planning requirements under regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and other banking laws and policies. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Federal Reserve, as part of its CCAR process, objected on qualitative grounds to the capital plans the Company submitted. In its 2016 public report on CCAR, the Federal Reserve cited broad and substantial weaknesses in the Company\u2019s capital planning processes, including weaknesses in assumptions and analysis underlying the capital plan and capital adequacy process, and deficiencies in the risk management framework, including features of risk measurement and monitoring, stress testing processes, governance, internal controls and oversight functions. As a result of the CCAR objections, the Company is not permitted to make any capital distributions without the Federal Reserve's approval, other than the continued payment of dividends on the Company\u2019s outstanding class of preferred stock, until a new capital plan is approved by the Federal Reserve. There is the risk that the Federal Reserve will object to the Company\u2019s next capital plan.\nIn addition, we are subject to supervisory actions in the United States related to the CCAR stress testing and capital planning processes. Specifically, on September 15, 2014, the Company entered into a written agreement with the FRB of Boston. Under the terms of this written agreement, the Company must serve as a source of strength to the Bank; strengthen Board oversight of planned capital distributions by the Company and its subsidiaries; and not declare or pay, and not permit any non-bank subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company to declare or pay, any dividends, and not make, or permit any such subsidiary to make, any capital distribution, in each case without the prior written approval of the FRB of Boston.\nOther supervisory actions and restrictions on U.S. activities\nIn addition to the foregoing, U.S. bank regulatory agencies from time to time take supervisory actions under certain circumstances that restrict or limit a financial institution\u2019s activities. In some instances, we are subject to significant legal restrictions on our ability to publicly disclose these actions or the full details of these actions. In addition, as part of the regular examination process, certain U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 regulators may advise certain U.S. subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. The U.S. supervisory environment has become significantly more demanding and restrictive since the financial crisis of 2008. Under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve has the authority to disallow us and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries from engaging in certain categories of new activities in the United States or acquiring shares or control of other companies in the United States. Such actions and restrictions currently applicable to us or certain of our U.S. subsidiaries could adversely affect our costs and revenues. Moreover, efforts to comply with nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions could require material investments in additional resources and systems, as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention. As a result, such supervisory actions or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may be subject to significant legal restrictions on our ability to publicly disclose these matters or the full details of these actions. In addition to such confidential actions and restrictions, on July 2, 2015, the Company entered into a written agreement with the FRB of Boston. Under the terms of that written agreement, the Company is required to make enhancements with respect to, among other matters, Board oversight of the consolidated organization, risk management, capital planning and liquidity risk management.\nWe are subject to potential intervention by any of our regulators or supervisors, particularly in response to customer complaints.\nAs noted above, our business and operations are subject to increasingly significant rules and regulations relating to banking and financial services business. These apply to business operations, affect financial returns, include reserve and reporting requirements, and prudential and conduct of business regulations. These requirements are set by the relevant central banks and regulatory authorities that authorize, regulate and supervise us in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIn their supervisory roles, regulators seek to maintain the safety and soundness of financial institutions with the aim of strengthening, but not guaranteeing, the protection of customers and the financial system. Supervisors' continuing supervision of financial institutions is conducted through a variety of regulatory tools, including the collection of information by way of reports obtained from skilled persons, visits to firms and regular meetings with management to discuss issues such as performance, risk management and strategy. In general, regulators have an outcome-focused regulatory approach that involves proactive enforcement and penalties for infringement. As a result, we face increased supervisory intrusion and scrutiny (resulting in increasing internal compliance costs and supervision fees), and in the event of a breach of our regulatory obligations we are likely to face more stringent regulatory fines. Some of the regulators focus strongly on consumer protection and on conduct risk and will continue to do so. This has included a focus on the design and operation of products, the behavior of customers and the operation of markets. Some of the laws in the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate give regulators the power to make temporary product intervention rules either to improve a company's systems and controls in relation to product design, product management and implementation, or address problems identified with financial products. These problems may potentially cause significant detriment to consumers because of certain product features, governance flaws or distribution strategies. Such rules may prevent institutions from entering into product agreements with customers until such problems have been solved. Some regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate also require us to be in compliance with training, authorization and supervision of personnel, systems, processes and documentation requirements. Sales practices with retail customers, including incentive compensation structures related to such practices, have recently been a focus of various regulatory and governmental agencies. If we fail to be compliant with such regulations, there would be a risk of an adverse impact on our business from sanctions, fines or other actions imposed by regulatory authorities. Customers of financial services institutions, including our customers, may seek redress if they consider that they have suffered loss as a result of the mis-selling of a particular product, or through incorrect application of the terms and conditions of a particular product. Given the inherent unpredictability of litigation and the evolution of judgments by the relevant authorities, it is possible that an adverse outcome in some matters could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects arising from any penalties imposed or compensation awarded, together with the costs of defending such actions, thereby reducing our profitability.\nWe are exposed to risk of loss from legal and regulatory proceedings.\nAs noted above, we face risk of loss from legal and regulatory proceedings, including tax proceedings that could subject us to monetary judgments, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties. The current regulatory environment reflects an increased supervisory focus on enforcement, combined with uncertainty about the evolution of the regulatory regime, and may lead to material operational and compliance costs.\nWe are subject to certain claims and party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business from time to time, including in connection with lending activities, relationships with our employees and other commercial or tax matters. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly when the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or when the cases present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in the early stages of discovery, we cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter may be. We believe that we have established adequate reserves related to the costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with these various claims and legal proceedings. However, the amount of these provisions is substantially less than the total amount of the claims asserted against us and, in light of the uncertainties involved in such claims and proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have currently accrued. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for a particular period, depending upon, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and our level of income for that period.\nIn addition, from time to time, the Company is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by the SEC and law enforcement authorities.\nOften, the announcement or other publication of claims or actions that may arise from such litigation and proceedings or of any related settlement may spur the initiation of similar claims by other clients or governmental entities. In any such claim or action, demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us and may result in financial liability, changes in our business practices or an adverse effect on our reputation or client demand for our products and services. In regulatory settlements since the financial crisis, fines imposed by regulators have increased substantially and may in some cases exceed the profit earned or harm caused by the breach.\nOur operations are subject to regular and ongoing inspection by our banking and other regulators in the U.S. As a result of such inspections, regulators may identify areas in which we may need to take actions, which may be significant, to enhance our regulatory compliance or risk management practices. Such remedial actions may entail significant costs, management attention, and systems development, and such efforts may affect our ability to expand our business until those remedial actions are completed. In some instances, we are subjected to significant legal restrictions on our ability to disclose these types of actions or the full detail of these actions publicly. Our failure to implement enhanced compliance and risk management procedures in a manner and timeframe deemed to be responsive by the applicable regulatory authority could adversely impact our relationship with that regulatory authority and lead to restrictions on our activities or other sanctions.\nIn addition, the magnitude and complexity of projects required to address the expectations of the Company\u2019s regulators\u2019 and legal proceedings, in addition to the challenging macroeconomic environment and pace of regulatory change, may result in execution risk and adversely affect the successful execution of such regulatory or legal priorities.\nIn many cases, we are required to self-report inappropriate or non-compliant conduct to regulatory authorities, and our failure to do so may represent an independent regulatory violation. Even when we promptly bring matters to the attention of appropriate authorities, we may nonetheless experience regulatory fines, liabilities to clients, harm to our reputation or other adverse effects in connection with self-reported matters.\nWe may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis, which could expose us to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations require us, among other things, to adopt and enforce \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed, require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel, and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision.\nWhile we have adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities, those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by other parties to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities. To the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, the relevant government agencies to which we report have the authority to impose fines and other penalties on us. In addition, our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or other illegal or improper purposes.\nWhile we review our relevant counterparties\u2019 internal policies and procedures with respect to such matters, to a large degree, we rely on our relevant counterparties to maintain and properly apply their own appropriate anti-money laundering procedures. Such measures, procedures and compliance may not be completely effective in preventing third parties from using our and our relevant counterparties\u2019 services as a conduits for money laundering (including illegal cash operations) or other illegal activities without our and our counterparties\u2019 knowledge. If we are associated with, or even accused of being associated with, or become a party to, money laundering or other illegal activities, our reputation could suffer and/or we could become subject to fines, sanctions and/or legal enforcement (including being added to any \u201cblacklists\u201d that would prohibit certain parties from engaging in transactions with us), any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nAn incorrect interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely affect us.\nThe preparation of our tax returns requires the use of estimates and interpretations of complex tax laws and regulations, and is subject to review by taxing authorities. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States and certain foreign countries. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and relevant governmental taxing authorities, which are sometimes subject to prolonged evaluation periods until a final resolution is reached. In establishing a provision for income tax expense and filing returns, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. If the judgments, estimates, and assumptions we use in preparing our tax returns are subsequently found to be incorrect, there could be a material effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in taxes and other assessments may adversely affect us.\nThe legislatures and tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate regularly enact reforms to the tax and other assessment regimes to which we and our customers are subject. Such reforms include changes in the rate of assessments and, occasionally, enactment of temporary taxes, the proceeds of which are earmarked for designated governmental purposes. The effects of these changes and any other changes that result from enactment of additional tax reforms cannot be quantified and there can be no assurance that any such reforms would not have an adverse effect upon our business.\nLiquidity and Financing Risks\nLiquidity and funding risks are inherent in our business and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we either do not have available sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations as they become due or can secure them only at excessive cost. This risk is inherent in any retail and commercial banking business and can be heightened by a number of enterprise-specific factors, including over-reliance on a particular source of funding, changes in credit ratings or market-wide phenomena such as market dislocation. While we implement liquidity management processes to seek to mitigate and control these risks, unforeseen systemic market factors in particular make it difficult to eliminate these risks completely. Adverse and continued constraints in the supply of liquidity, including inter-bank lending, may materially and adversely affect the cost of funding our business, and extreme liquidity constraints may affect our current operations and our ability to fulfill regulatory liquidity requirements as well as limit growth possibilities.\nDisruption and volatility in the global financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access capital and liquidity on financial terms acceptable to us.\nOur cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market interest rates and to our credit spreads. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can significantly increase the cost of our funding. Changes in our credit spreads are market-driven, and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness. Changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile.\nIf wholesale markets financing ceases to become available, or becomes excessively expensive, we may be forced to raise the rates we pay on deposits, with a view to attracting more customers, and/or to sell assets, potentially at depressed prices. The persistence or worsening of these adverse market conditions or an increase in base interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access liquidity and cost of funding.\nWe rely, and will continue to rely, primarily on deposits to fund lending activities. The ongoing availability of this type of funding is sensitive to a variety of factors outside our control, such as general economic conditions and the confidence of depositors in the economy, in general, and the financial services industry in particular, as well as competition between banks for deposits. Any of these factors could significantly increase the amount of deposit withdrawals in a short period of time, thereby reducing our ability to access deposit funding in the future on appropriate terms, or at all. If these circumstances were to arise, they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe anticipate that our customers will continue to make deposits (particularly demand deposits and short-term time deposits) in the near future, and we intend to maintain our emphasis on the use of banking deposits as a source of funds. The short-term nature of some deposits could cause liquidity problems for us in the future if deposits are not made in the volumes we expect or are not renewed. If a substantial number of our depositors withdraw their demand deposits or do not roll over their time deposits upon maturity, we may be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that, in the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking system, we will be able to maintain levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, a reduction in the term of funding instruments, or the liquidation of certain assets. If this were to happen, we could be materially adversely affected.\nCredit, market and liquidity risk may have an adverse effect on our credit ratings and our cost of funds. Any downgrading in our credit rating would likely increase our cost of funding, require us to post additional collateral or take other actions under some of our derivative contracts and adversely affect our interest margins and results of operations.\nCredit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Rating agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings of our debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.\nAny downgrade in our or Santander's debt credit ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs and require us to post additional collateral or take other actions under some of our derivative contracts, and could limit our access to capital markets and adversely affect our commercial business. For example, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our products, engage in certain longer-term and derivatives transactions and retain customers, particularly customers who need a minimum rating threshold in order to invest. In addition, under the terms of certain of our derivative contracts, we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or terminate the contracts. Any of these results of a ratings downgrade, in turn, could reduce our liquidity and have an adverse effect on us, including our operating results and financial condition.\nWe conduct a significant number of our material derivative activities through Santander and Santander UK. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2016, if all of the rating agencies were to downgrade Santander\u2019s or Santander UK\u2019s long-term senior debt ratings, we would be required to post additional collateral pursuant to derivative and other financial contracts. Refer to further discussion in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWhile certain potential impacts of these downgrades are contractual and quantifiable, the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain, as they depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including market conditions at the time of any downgrade, whether any downgrade of a company's long-term credit rating precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit rating, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. Actual outflows could be higher or lower than this hypothetical example, depending on certain factors including which credit rating agency downgrades our credit rating, any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce cash outflows and the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding (such as from money market funds) or loss of secured funding capacity. Although unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in our stress testing scenarios and a portion of our total liquid assets is held against these risks, it is still the case that a credit rating downgrade could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the Bank, and SC.\nIn addition, if we were required to cancel our derivatives contracts with certain counterparties and were unable to replace those contracts, our market risk profile could be altered.\nThere can be no assurance that the rating agencies will maintain their current ratings or outlooks. Failure to maintain favorable ratings and outlooks could increase the cost of funding and adversely affect interest margins, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nCredit Risks\nIf the level of our non-performing loans increases or our credit quality deteriorates in the future, or if our loan and lease loss reserves are insufficient to cover loan and lease losses, this could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks arising from changes in credit quality and the recoverability of loans and amounts due from counterparties are inherent in a wide range of our businesses. Non-performing or low credit quality loans have in the past negatively impacted and can continue to negatively impact our results of operations. In particular, the amount of our reported non-performing loans may increase in the future as a result of growth in our total loan portfolio, including as a result of loan portfolios that we may acquire in the future, or factors beyond our control, such as adverse changes in the credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties or a general deterioration in economic conditions in the United States, the impact of political events, events affecting certain industries or events affecting financial markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively control the level of the non-performing loans (\"NPLs\") in our loan portfolio.\nOur loan and lease loss reserves are based on our current assessment of and expectations concerning various factors affecting the quality of our loan portfolio. These factors include, among other things, our borrowers\u2019 financial condition, repayment abilities and repayment intentions, the realizable value of any collateral, the prospects for support from any guarantor, government macroeconomic policies, interest rates and the legal and regulatory environment. As the last global financial crisis demonstrated, many of these factors are beyond our control. As a result, there is no precise method for predicting loan and credit losses, and there can be no assurance that our current or future loan and lease loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses. If our assessment of and expectations concerning the above-mentioned factors differ from actual developments, if the quality of our total loan portfolio deteriorates for any reason, including an increase in lending to individuals and small and medium enterprises, a volume increase in our credit card portfolio or the introduction of new products, or if future actual losses exceed our estimates of incurred losses, we may be required to increase our loan and lease loss reserves, which may adversely affect us. If we were unable to control or reduce the level of our non-performing or poor credit quality loans, this also could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMortgage loans are one of our principal assets, comprising 9.1% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we have exposure to a number of large real estate developers. As a result, we are exposed to developments in housing markets. From 2002 to 2007, demand for housing and mortgage financing increased significantly driven by, among other things, economic growth, declining unemployment rates, demographic and social trends and historically low interest rates. During late 2007, the housing market began to adjust as a result of excess supply and higher interest rates. For a prolonged time after 2008, persistent housing oversupply, decreased housing demand, rising unemployment, subdued earnings growth, greater pressure on disposable income, a decline in the availability of mortgage financing and the continued effect of market volatility caused home prices to decline, while mortgage delinquencies increased. Higher unemployment rates coupled with declining real estate prices, could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage payment delinquency rates, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur loan and investment portfolios are subject to risk of prepayment, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur fixed rate loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk, which results from the ability of a borrower or issuer to pay a debt obligation prior to maturity. Generally, in a low interest rate environment, prepayment activity increases, and this reduces the weighted average life of our earning assets and could have a material adverse effect on us. We would also be required to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period of time, thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interest income. Prepayment risk also has a significant adverse impact on credit card and collateralized mortgage loans, since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these assets, which may result in a mismatch in our funding obligations and reinvestment at lower yields. Prepayment risk is inherent in our commercial activity, and an increase in prepayments could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe value of the collateral securing our loans may not be sufficient, and we may be unable to realize the full value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio.\nThe value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio may fluctuate or decline due to factors beyond our control, including macroeconomic factors affecting the United States. The value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio may be adversely affected by force majeure events such as natural disasters, particularly in locations in which a significant portion of our loan portfolio is composed of real estate loans. Natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods may cause widespread damage, which could impair the asset quality of our loan portfolio and have an adverse impact on the economy of the affected region. We also may not have sufficiently recent information on the value of collateral, which may result in an inaccurate assessment of impairment losses of our loans secured by such collateral. If any of the above were to occur, we may need to make additional provisions to cover actual impairment losses of our loans, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk in our banking business.\nWe are exposed to counterparty risk in addition to credit risks associated with lending activities. Counterparty risk may arise from, for example, investing in securities of third parties, entering into derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us or executing securities, futures, currency or commodity trades from proprietary trading activities that fail to settle at the required time due to non-delivery by the counterparty or systems failure by clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries.\nWe routinely transact with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional clients. We rely on information provided by or on behalf of counterparties, such as financial statements, and we may rely on representations of our counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Defaults by, and even rumors or questions about the solvency of, certain financial institutions and the financial services industry generally have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by other institutions. Many of the routine transactions we enter into expose us to significant credit risk in the event of default by one of our significant counterparties.\nMarket Risks\nWe are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and other market risks, which may materially and adversely affect us.\nMarket risk refers to the probability of variations in our net interest income or in the market value of our assets and liabilities due to volatility of interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices. Changes in interest rates affect the following areas, among others, of our business:\n\u2022\nnet interest income;\n\u2022\nthe volume of loans originated;\n\u2022\nthe market value of our securities holdings;\n\u2022\ngains from sales of loans and securities; and\n\u2022\ngains and losses from derivatives.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including increased regulation of the financial sector, monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors. Variations in interest rates could affect our net interest income, which comprises the majority of our revenue, reducing our growth rate and potentially resulting in losses. This is a result of the different effect a change in interest rates may have on the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our borrowings. In addition, we may incur costs (which, in turn, will impact our results) as we implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure.\nIncreases in interest rates may reduce the volume of loans we originate. Sustained high interest rates have historically discouraged customers from borrowing and have resulted in increased delinquencies in outstanding loans and deterioration in the quality of assets. Increases in interest rates may also reduce the propensity of our customers to prepay or refinance fixed-rate loans. Increases in interest rates may reduce the value of our financial assets and may reduce gains or require us to record losses on sales of our loans or securities.\nIn addition, we may experience increased delinquencies in a low interest rate environment when such an environment is accompanied by high unemployment and recessionary conditions.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities denominated in different currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between currencies may negatively affect our earnings and value of our assets and securities.\nSome of our investment management services fees are based on financial market valuations of assets certain of our subsidiaries manage or hold in custody for clients. Changes in these valuations can affect noninterest income positively or negatively, and ultimately affect our financial results. Significant changes in the volume of activity in the capital markets, and in the number of assignments we are awarded, could also affect our financial results.\nWe are also exposed to equity price risk in our investments in equity securities. The performance of financial markets may cause changes in the value of our investment and trading portfolios. The volatility of world equity markets due to economic uncertainty and sovereign debt concerns has had a particularly strong impact on the financial sector. Continued volatility may affect the value of our investments in equity securities and, depending on their fair value and future recovery expectations, could become a permanent impairment which would be subject to write-offs against our results. To the extent any of these risks materialize, our net interest income and the market value of our assets and liabilities could be materially adversely affected.\nMarket conditions have resulted, and could result, in material changes to the estimated fair values of our financial assets. Negative fair value adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nIn the past nine years, financial markets have been subject to volatility and the resulting widening of credit spreads. We have material exposures to securities and other investments that are recorded at fair value and are therefore exposed to potential negative fair value adjustments. Asset valuations in future periods, reflecting then-prevailing market conditions, may result in negative changes in the fair values of our financial assets, and also may translate into increased impairments. In addition, the value we ultimately realize on disposal of the asset may be lower than its current fair value. Any of these factors could require us to record negative fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, to the extent that fair values are determined using financial valuation models, such values may be inaccurate or subject to change, as the data used by such models may not be available or may become unavailable due to changes in market conditions, particularly for illiquid assets and in times of economic instability. In such circumstances, our valuation methodologies require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates in order to establish fair value, and reliable assumptions are difficult to make and are inherently uncertain. In addition, valuation models are complex, making them inherently imperfect predictors of actual results. Any resulting impairments or write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to market, operational and other related risks associated with our derivative transactions that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes as well as for hedging purposes. We are subject to market, credit and operational risks associated with these transactions, including basis risk (the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost) and credit or default risk (the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder, including providing sufficient collateral).\nThe execution and performance of derivative transactions depends on our ability to maintain adequate control and administration systems and to hire and retain qualified personnel. Moreover, our ability to adequately monitor, analyze and report derivative transactions continues to depend, to a great extent, on our information technology systems. These factors further increase the risks associated with these transactions and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, disputes with counterparties may arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts, including with respect to the value of underlying collateral, which could cause us to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, operational, legal and litigation costs, or result in credit losses, all of which may impair our ability to manage our risk exposure from these products.\nRisk Management\nFailure to successfully implement and continue to improve our risk management policies, procedures and methods, including our credit risk management system, could materially and adversely affect us, and we may be exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.\nThe management of risk is an integral part of our activities. We seek to monitor and manage our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, market, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems. Although we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, such techniques and strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that we fail to identify or anticipate.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.\nSome of our qualitative tools and metrics for managing risk are based on our use of observed historical market behavior. We apply statistical and other tools to these observations to arrive at quantifications of our risk exposures. These qualitative tools and metrics may fail to predict future risk exposures. These risk exposures could, for example, arise from factors we did not anticipate or correctly evaluate in our statistical models. This would limit our ability to manage our risks. Our losses therefore could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. In addition, our quantified modeling does not take all risks into account. Our more qualitative approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient, exposing us to material unanticipated losses. We could face adverse consequences as a result of decisions based on models that are poorly developed, implemented, or used, or as a result of a modeled outcome being misunderstood or used of for purposes for which it was not designed. In addition, if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate, they could take their business elsewhere or seek to limit transactions with us. This could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\nAs a commercial bank, one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk. For example, an important feature of our credit risk management is to employ an internal credit rating system to assess the particular risk profile of a customer. Since this process involves detailed analyses of the customer, taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors, it is subject to human or IT systems errors. In exercising their judgment on the current and future credit risk of our customers, our employees may not always assign an accurate credit rating, which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system.\nWe have been refining our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers. However, we may not be able to timely detect all possible risks before they occur or, due to limited tools available to us, our employees may not be able to implement them effectively, which may increase our credit risk. Failure to effectively implement, consistently follow or continuously refine our credit risk management system may result in an increase in the level of non-performing loans and a higher risk exposure for us, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nGeneral Business and Industry Risks\nThe financial problems our customers face could adversely affect us.\nMarket turmoil and economic recession could materially and adversely affect the liquidity, businesses and/or financial conditions of our borrowers, which could in turn increase our NPL ratios, impair our loan and other financial assets and result in decreased demand for borrowings in general. In addition, our customers may further decrease their risk tolerance to non-deposit investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds significantly, which would adversely affect our fee and commission income. Any of the conditions described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend in part upon dividends and other funds from subsidiaries.\nSome of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to pay dividends, to the extent we decide to do so, depends in part on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate earnings and pay dividends to us. Payment of dividends, distributions and advances by our subsidiaries will be contingent on our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and business considerations, and are limited by legal, regulatory, and contractual restrictions. Additionally, our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries as an equity holder of such subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of our subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including trade creditors.\nIncreased competition and industry consolidation may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face substantial competition in all parts of our business, including in originating loans and attracting deposits. Our competition in originating loans comes principally from other domestic and foreign banks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and other lenders and purchasers of loans.\nThere can be no assurance that increased competition will not adversely affect our growth prospects and therefore our operations. We also face competition from non-bank competitors, such as brokerage companies, department stores (for some credit products), leasing and factoring companies, mutual fund and pension fund management companies and insurance companies.\nIncreasing competition could require that we increase the rates we offer on deposits or lower the rates we charge on loans, which could also have a material adverse effect on us, including on our profitability. It may also negatively affect our business results and prospects by, among other things, limiting our ability to increase our customer base and expand our operations and increasing competition for investment opportunities.\nIn addition, if our customer service levels were perceived by the market to be materially below those of our competitors, we could lose existing and potential business. If we are not successful in retaining and strengthening customer relationships, we may lose market share, incur losses on some or all of our activities or fail to attract new deposits or retain existing deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position depends, in part, on the success of new products and services we offer our clients and our ability to continue offering products and services from third parties, and we may not be able to manage various risks we face as we expand our range of products and services that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe success of our operations and our profitability depend, in part, on the success of new products and services we offer our clients and our ability to continue offering products and services from third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that our new products and services will be responsive to client demands or successful once they are offered to our clients, or that they will be successful in the future. In addition, our clients\u2019 needs or desires may change over time, and such changes may render our products and services obsolete, outdated or unattractive, and we may not be able to develop new products that meet our clients\u2019 changing needs. If we cannot respond in a timely fashion to the changing needs of our clients, we may lose clients, which could in turn materially and adversely affect us.\nAdvances in technology have allowed non-bank institutions to offer products and services traditionally regarded as banking products, and for our banking and non-banking competitors to offer electronic and internet-based services. New technologies could require the Company to modify or enhance its products and services to attract and retain customers and remain competitive.\nThe introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including technical and control requirements that may need to be developed and implemented, rapid technological change in the industry, our ability to access technical and other information from our clients and the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices. Our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes us to the enhanced risk of operational lapses, which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine whether initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our clients. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation, as well as on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nAs we expand the range of our products and services, some of which may be at an early stage of development in the markets of certain regions in which we operate, we will be exposed to new and potentially increasingly complex risks and development expenses. Our employees and risk management systems as well as our experience and that of our partners may not be adequate to enable us to handle or manage such risks properly. In addition, the cost of developing products that are not launched is likely to affect our results of operations. Any or all of these factors, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFurther, our customers may assert complaints and seek redress if they consider that they have suffered loss from our products or services, for example, as a result of any alleged mis-selling or incorrect application of the terms or conditions of a particular product. This could in turn subject us to risks of potential legal action by our customers and intervention by our regulators. For further detail on our legal and regulatory risk exposures, please see the Risk Factor entitled \u201cWe are exposed to risk of loss from legal and regulatory proceedings.\nIf we are unable to manage the growth of our operations, this could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nWe cannot ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to manage our growth effectively or deliver our strategic growth objectives. Challenges that may result from our strategic growth decisions include our ability to:\n\u2022\nmanage efficiently the operations and employees of expanding businesses;\n\u2022\nmaintain or grow our existing customer base;\n\u2022\nalign our current IT systems adequately with those of an enlarged group;\n\u2022\napply our risk management policies effectively to an enlarged group; and\n\u2022\nmanage a growing number of entities without over-committing management or losing key personnel.\nAny failure to manage growth effectively, including any or all of the above challenges associated with our growth plans, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nGoodwill impairments may be required in relation to acquired businesses.\nWe have made business acquisitions for which it is possible that the goodwill which has been attributed to those businesses may have to be written down if our valuation assumptions are required to be reassessed as a result of any deterioration in the business\u2019 underlying profitability, asset quality or other relevant matters. Impairment testing with respect to goodwill is performed annually, more frequently if impairment indicators are present, and includes a comparison of the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment exists and a second step to measure the amount of impairment, if any, must be performed. This second step involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination upon acquisition. There were no impairments of goodwill recognized in 2014 or 2016. The Company recorded a goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the goodwill from the first quarter consolidation and Change in Control of SC. It is reasonably possible we may be required to record impairment of our remaining $4.5 billion of goodwill attributable to SC and SBNA in the future. There can be no assurance that we will not have to write down the value attributed to goodwill further in the future, which would not impact risk-based capital ratios adversely, but would adversely affect our results of operations and stockholder's equity.\nWe rely on recruiting, retaining and developing appropriate senior management and skilled personnel.\nOur continued success depends in part on the continued service of key members of our management team. The ability to continue to attract, train, motivate and retain highly qualified professionals is a key element of our strategy. The successful implementation of our growth strategy depends on the availability of skilled management, both at our head office and at each of our business units. If we or one of our business units or other functions fails to staff its operations appropriately or loses one or more of its key senior executives and fails to replace them in a satisfactory and timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations, including control and operational risks, may be adversely affected.\nThe financial industry in the United States has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees. In addition, due to our relationship with Santander, we are subject to indirect regulation by the European Central Bank, which has recently imposed compensation restrictions that may apply to certain of our executive officers and other employees under the Capital Requirements Directive IV prudential rules. These restrictions may impact our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees and our ability to attract appropriately qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail or are unable to attract and train, motivate and retain qualified professionals appropriately, our business may also be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties for important products and services.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as loan and deposit servicing systems, internet connections and network access. Third parties can be sources of operational risk to us, including with respect to security breaches affecting those parties. We may be required to take steps to protect the integrity of our operational systems, thereby increasing our operational costs and potentially decreasing customer satisfaction. In addition, any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason, their performing their services poorly, or employee misconduct could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise to conduct business. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delays and expense.\nDamage to our reputation could cause harm to our business prospects.\nMaintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including, among others, employee misconduct, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior, and the activities of customers and counterparties. Further, adverse publicity, regulatory actions or fines, litigation, operational failures or the failure to meet client expectations or other obligations could materially and adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain clients or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses.\nActions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of, or individuals in, the industry can also affect our reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis and the seeming shift toward increasing regulatory supervision and enforcement has caused public perception of us and others in the financial services industry to decline.\nPreserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems, procedures and controls that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to timely identify, understand and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate, the regulatory environment and customer expectations.\nWe could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest properly. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions against us. Therefore, there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.\nThe Bank engages in transactions with its subsidiaries or affiliates that others may not consider to be on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\nThe Bank and its subsidiaries have entered into a number of services agreements pursuant to which we render services, such as administrative, accounting, finance, treasury, legal services and others.\nUnited States law applicable to public companies and financial groups and institutions provide for several procedures designed to ensure that the transactions entered into with or among our subsidiaries and/or affiliates do not deviate from prevailing market conditions for those types of transactions.\nThe Bank is likely to continue to engage in transactions with our affiliates. Future conflicts of interests between us and any of affiliates, or among our affiliates, may arise, which conflicts are not required to be and may not be resolved in our favor.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, natural or otherwise, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.\nNeither the occurrence nor potential impact of disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions, pandemics, dislocations, fires, explosions, and other catastrophic accidents or events), terrorist activities or international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly (for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. These types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies and defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning and our ability to anticipate the nature of any such event that may occur. The adverse impact of disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses with which we deal.\nTechnology Risks\nAny failure to effectively improve or upgrade our IT infrastructure and management information systems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to upgrade our IT on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must continually make significant investments and improvements in our IT infrastructure in order to remain competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the level of capital expenditures necessary to support the improvement or upgrading of our IT infrastructure in the future. Any failure to improve or upgrade our IT infrastructure and management information systems effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks relating to data collection, processing, storage systems and security are inherent in our business.\nLike other financial institutions with a large customer base, we manage and hold confidential personal information of customers in the conduct of our banking operations, as well as a large number of assets. Our business depends on the ability to process a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately, and on our ability to rely on our digital technologies, computer and e-mail services, spreadsheets, software and networks, as well as on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. The proper functioning of financial controls, accounting and other data collection and processing systems is critical to our businesses and our ability to compete effectively. Losses can result from inadequate personnel, inadequate or failed internal control processes and systems, or external events that interrupt normal business operations. We also face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures proves to be inadequate or is circumvented. Although we work with our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and prevent information security risk, we routinely exchange personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means, and we may be the target of attempted cyber-attacks such as denial of services, malware and phishing-based attacks. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication, and we may incur significant costs in our attempts to modify and enhance our protective measures, investigate or remediate any vulnerability or resulting breach, or communicate with our customers regarding cyber-attacks. If we are unable to maintain an effective data collection, management and processing system, we may be materially and adversely affected, including with regard to our reputation, operating results, financial condition and prospects through the payment of compensation to customers, regulatory penalties and fines, and/or the loss of assets.\nWe take protective measures and continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, but our systems, software and networks nevertheless may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact or give rise to the loss of significant amounts of sensitive information, as well as significant levels of liquid assets, including cash. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information sent to or received from a client, vendor, service provider, counterparty or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses from operational risk in the future, including relating to any security breaches.\nComputer systems of companies have been targeted in recent years, not only by cyber criminals, but also by activists and rogue states. We have been and continue to be subject to a range of cyber-attacks, such as denial of service, malware and phishing. Cyber-attacks could give rise to the loss of significant amounts of customer data and other sensitive information, as well as significant levels of liquid assets (including cash). In addition, cyber-attacks could give rise to the disablement of IT systems used to service our customers. As attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication, we may incur significant costs in our attempts to modify or enhance our protective measures against such attacks to investigate or remediate any vulnerability or resulting breach, or in communicating cyber-attacks to our customers. Failure to effectively manage our cyber security risk could harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and prospects through the payment of compensation to customers, regulatory penalties and fines, and/or the loss of assets.\nA breach in the security of our systems could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and create significant financial and legal exposures.\nAlthough we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us, our customers and clients, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Many institutions in our industry have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties such as persons associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as we increase mobile and internet-based product offerings and expand internal usage of web-based applications.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems and those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFinancial Reporting and Control Risks\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe accounting standard setters and other regulatory bodies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if inaccurate, could cause material misstatement of the results of our operations and financial position.\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. The accounting policies deemed critical to our results and financial position, based upon materiality and significant judgments and estimates, include impairment of loans and advances, goodwill impairment, valuation of financial instruments, impairment of available-for-sale financial assets, deferred tax assets and provisions for liabilities.\nThe allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") is a significant critical estimate. Due to the inherent nature of this estimate, we cannot provide assurance that the Company will not significantly increase the ACL or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance.\nThe valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value can be subjective, in particular when models are used which include unobservable inputs. Given the uncertainty and subjectivity associated with valuing such instruments it is possible that the results of our operations and financial position could be materially misstated if the estimates and assumptions used prove inaccurate.\nIf the judgments, estimates and assumptions we use in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements are subsequently found to be incorrect, there could be a material effect on our results of operations and a corresponding effect on our funding requirements and capital ratios.\nDisclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nDisclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms.\nThese disclosure controls and procedures have inherent limitations, which include the possibilities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by any unauthorized override of the controls. Consequently, our businesses are exposed to risk from potential non-compliance with policies, employee misconduct or negligence and fraud, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. In recent years, a number of multinational financial institutions have suffered material losses due to the actions of \u2018rogue traders\u2019 or other employees. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not always be effective. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in the control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nLapses in internal controls including internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, liquidity and/or reputation.\nWe have identified control deficiencies in our financial reporting process and for which remediation was still in process as of December 31, 2016. These control deficiencies contributed to the restatement of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in our previously filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Part II, Item 9A in this Form 10-K. We have initiated certain measures, including increasing the number of employees on, and the expertise of, our financial reporting team, and the enhancement of our model risk management framework and documentation process to remediate these weaknesses, and plan to implement additional appropriate measures as part of this effort. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully remediate our existing material weaknesses. Further, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer from other material weaknesses in the future. If we fail to remediate these material weaknesses or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, such failure could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial statements and limit our ability to raise capital. Additionally, failure to remediate the material weaknesses or otherwise failing to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition, impair our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, subject us to additional litigation and regulatory actions and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\nInternal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that we timely report information as required in the SEC\u2019s rules and regulations. We also maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting. However, these controls may not achieve, and in some cases have not achieved, their intended objectives. Control processes that involve human diligence and compliance, such as our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, are subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Controls can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected, and that information may not be reported on a timely basis. If our controls are not effective, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting for which remediation was still in process as of December 31, 2016. Certain of these material weaknesses involved the design of controls and failure of controls to operate effectively, resulting in misstatements in our publicly filed financial statements. As a result, we restated the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the unaudited financial statements included in certain of our previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nIf we are unable to effectively remediate and adequately manage our internal controls over financial reporting in the future, we may be unable to produce accurate or timely financial information. Any negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements could lead investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial data and could adversely affect our business. Significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain.\nFailure to satisfy obligations associated with being a public company may have adverse regulatory, economic, and reputational consequences.\nAs a public company, we are required to prepare and distribute periodic reports containing our Consolidated Financial Statements with the SEC, evaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management\u2019s assessment thereof, in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and maintain internal policies, including those relating to disclosure controls and procedures.\nOn March 31, 2016, we filed an extension request under Rule 12b-25 with the SEC, resulting in the extension of the deadline for filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K from 90 days after the fiscal year-end (March 30, 2016) to 105 days after the fiscal year end (April 14, 2016). On August 16, 2016, we filed an extension request under Rule 12b-25 with the SEC, resulting in the extension of the deadline for filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q from 46 days after the fiscal quarter-end (August 15, 2016) to 53 days after the fiscal quarter-end (August 22, 2016). On November 15, 2016, we filed an extension request under Rule 12b-25 with the SEC, resulting in the extension of the deadline for filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2016 from 45 days after the fiscal quarter-end (November 14, 2016) to 51 days after the fiscal quarter-end (November 21, 2016). We did not file those quarterly reports by the extensions of the deadlines for them. Those failures to file our periodic reports for the second and third quarters of 2016 within the time periods prescribed by the SEC have, among other consequences, resulted in the suspension of our eligibility to use Form S-3 registration statements until we have timely filed our SEC periodic reports for a period of 12 months. Our inability to use Form S-3 registration statements will increase the time and resources we need to expend if we choose to access the public capital markets. If in the future we are not able to file our periodic reports within the time periods prescribed by the SEC, among other consequences, the suspension of our eligibility to use Form S-3 registration statements until we have timely filed our SEC periodic reports for a period of 12 months would continue.\nRisks Associated with our Majority-Owned Consolidated Subsidiary\nThe financial results of SC could have a negative impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nSC historically has provided a significant source of funding to the Company through earnings. Our investment in SC involves risk, including the possibility that poor operating results of SC could negatively affect the operating results of SHUSA.\nFactors that affect the financial results of SC in addition to those which have been previously addressed include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nPeriods of economic slowdown may result in decreased demand for automobiles as well as declining values of automobiles and other consumer products used as collateral to secure outstanding loans. Higher gasoline prices, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors which impact consumer confidence could increase loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for automobiles. In addition, during an economic slowdown, servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in finance charge income. Changes in the economy may impact the collateral value of repossessed automobiles and repossession, and foreclosure sales may not yield sufficient proceeds to repay the receivables in full and result in losses.\n\u2022\nSC\u2019s growth strategy is subject to significant risks, some of which are outside its control, including general economic conditions, the ability to obtain adequate financing for growth, laws and regulatory environments in the states in which the business seeks to operate, competition in new markets, the ability to attract new customers, the ability to recruit qualified personnel, and the ability to obtain and maintain all required approvals, permits, and licenses on a timely basis\n\u2022\nSC\u2019s business may be negatively impacted if it is unsuccessful in developing and maintaining relationships with automobile dealerships that correlate to SC\u2019s ability to acquire loans and automotive leases. In addition, economic downturns may result in the closure of dealerships and corresponding decreases in sales and loan volumes.\n\u2022\nSC's business could be negatively impacted if it is unsuccessful in developing and maintaining its serviced for others portfolio. As this is a significant and growing portion of SC's business strategy, if an institution for which SC currently services assets chooses to terminate SC's rights as a servicer or if SC fails to add additional institutions or portfolios to its servicing platform, SC may not achieve the desired revenue or income from this platform.\n\u2022\nSC has repurchase obligations in its capacity as a servicer in securitizations and whole loan sales. If significant repurchases of assets or other payments are required under its responsibility as a servicer, this could have a material adverse effect on SC\u2019s financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention which increases the costs of SC's operations and may divert focus from business operations. As a result of its IPO, SC is now required to remain in compliance with the reporting requirements of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), maintain corporate infrastructure required of a public company, and incur significant legal and financial compliance costs, which may divert SC management\u2019s attention and resources from implementing its growth strategy.\n\u2022\nThe market price of SC Common Stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in SC Common Stock to decline. Conditions affecting the market price of SC Common Stock may be beyond SC\u2019s control and include general market conditions, economic factors, actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly operating results, changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations related to future financial performance, analysts\u2019 estimates of SC\u2019s financial performance or lack of research or reports by industry analysts, changes in market valuations of similar companies, future sales of SC Common Stock, or additions or departures of its key personnel.\n\u2022\nSC's business and results of operations could be negatively impacted if it fails to manage and complete divestitures. SC regularly evaluates its portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer be aligned with its strategic objectives. For example, in October 2015, SC disclosed a decision to exit the personal lending business and to explore strategic alternatives for its existing personal lending assets. Of its two primary lending relationships, SC completed the sale of substantially all of its loans associated with the Lending Club relationship in February 2016. SC continues to classify loans from its other primary lending relationship, Bluestem, as held-for-sale. SC remains a party to agreements with Bluestem that obligate it to purchase new advances originated by Bluestem, along with existing balances on accounts with new advances, for an initial term ending in April 2020 and which is renewable through April 2022 at Bluestem's option. Although SC is seeking a third party willing and able to take on this obligation, it may not be successful in finding such a party, and Bluestem may not agree to the substitution. SC has recorded significant lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments on this portfolio and may continue to do so as long as the portfolio is held, particularly due to the new volume it is committed to purchase.\n\u2022\nSC's business could be negatively impacted if access to funding is reduced. Adverse changes in SC's ABS program or in the ABS market generally could materially adversely affect its ability to securitize loans on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to SC. This could increase its cost of funding, reduce its margins, or cause it to hold assets until investor demand improves.\n\u2022\nAs with SHUSA, adverse outcomes to current and future litigation against SC may negatively impact its financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. SC is party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. In particular, as a consumer finance company, it is subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties. Some litigation against it could take the form of class action complaints by consumers. As the assignee of loans originated by automotive dealers, it also may be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against automotive dealers.\nSC's agreement with FCA may not result in currently anticipated levels of growth and is subject to certain performance conditions that could result in termination of the agreement. If we fail to meet certain of these performance conditions, FCA may elect to terminate the agreement.\nIn February 2013, SC entered into a ten-year Master Private Label Financing Agreement (the Chrysler Agreement) with FCA whereby SC launched the Chrysler Capital brand, which originates private-label loans and leases to facilitate the purchase of FCA vehicles by consumers and FCA-franchised automotive dealers. The financing services that SC provides under the Chrysler Agreement, which launched May 1, 2013, include credit lines to finance FCA-franchised dealers\u2019 acquisitions of vehicles and other products that FCA sells or distributes, automotive loans and leases to finance consumer acquisitions of new and used vehicles at FCA-franchised dealerships, financing for commercial and fleet customers, and ancillary services. In addition, SC may facilitate, for an affiliate, offerings to dealers for dealer loan financing, construction loans, real estate loans, working capital loans, and revolving lines of credit. In accordance with the terms of the Chrysler Agreement, in May 2013 SC paid FCA a $150 million upfront, nonrefundable payment, which will be amortized over ten years. The unamortized portion would be recognized as expense immediately if the Chrysler Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.\nAs part of the Chrysler Agreement, SC received limited exclusivity rights to participate in specified minimum percentages of certain of FCA's financing incentive programs, which include loan rate subvention and automotive lease residual support subvention. SC has committed to certain revenue sharing arrangements. SC bears the risk of loss on loans originated pursuant to the Chrysler Agreement, while FCA shares in any residual gains and losses in respect of automotive leases, subject to specific provisions in the Chrysler Agreement, including limitations on our participation in gains and losses. In addition, under the Chrysler Agreement, FCA has the option to acquire, for fair market value, an equity participation in an operating entity through which the financial services contemplated by the Chrysler Agreement are offered and provided, through either an equity interest in the new entity or participation in a joint venture or other similar business relationship or structure. There is no maximum limit on the size of FCA\u2019s potential equity participation. Although the Chrysler Agreement contains provisions that are designed to address a situation in which the parties disagree on the fair market value of the equity participation interest, there is a risk that SC ultimately receives less than what SC believes to be the fair market value for such interest.\nThe Chrysler Agreement is subject to early termination in certain circumstances, including the failure by either party to comply with certain of their ongoing obligations under the Chrysler Agreement. These obligations include the Company's meeting specified escalating penetration rates for the first five years of the agreement. SC has not met these penetration rates in the past and may not meet these penetration rates in the future. If SC continues not to meet these specified penetration rates, FCA may elect to terminate the Chrysler Agreement. FCA may also terminate the agreement if, among other circumstances, (i) a person other than Santander and its affiliates or our other stockholders owns 20% or more of our common stock and Santander and its affiliates own fewer shares of common stock than such person, (ii) SC becomes, control, or become controlled by, an OEM that competes with FCA or (iii) certain of our credit facilities become impaired.\nThe loans and leases originated through Chrysler Capital are expected to provide us with a significant portion of our projected growth over the next several years. Our ability to realize the full strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with FCA depends in part on the successful development of our Chrysler Capital business, which will require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and effort. If SC is unable to realize the expected benefits of our relationship with FCA, or if the Chrysler Agreement were to terminate, there would be a materially adverse impact to our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, loan and lease volume, credit quality of our portfolio, liquidity, funding and growth, and the Company\u2019s ability to implement its business strategy would be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 10562, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "STD2"}
