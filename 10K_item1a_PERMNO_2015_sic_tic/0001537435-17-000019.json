{"cik": "1537435", "company": "TECOGEN INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, operations and the Company face many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading ''Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements'' before deciding whether to invest in our securities.\nTECOGEN INC.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations.\nIf the cash generated by operations is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions. These financings may not be available to us, or if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in significant dilution to our stockholders and reduction in the trading price of our stock. The state of worldwide capital markets could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations.\nIf we experience a period of significant growth or expansion, it could place a substantial strain on our resources.\nIf our cogeneration and chiller products penetrate the market rapidly, we would be required to deliver even larger volumes of technically complex products or components to our customers on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost to us. We have never ramped up our manufacturing capabilities to meet significant large-scale production requirements. If we were to commit to deliver large volumes of products, we may not be able to satisfy these commitments on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nOur operating history is characterized by net losses.\nFor each of our last five fiscal years and prior thereto, we have incurred annual operating losses. We do not expect this trend to continue. We believe we have adequate cash resources to reach the point of full year profitability. Even if we do achieve this annual profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the supply of key components for our products.\nWe use third-party suppliers for components in all of our products. Our engine supplier, generator supplier for cogeneration products (other than the InVerde), and the compressor and vessel sets in our chillers, are all purchased from large multinational equipment manufacturers. The loss of one or more of our suppliers could materially, and adversely affect our business if we are unable to replace them. While alternate suppliers for the manufacture of our engine, generator and compressor have been identified, should the need arise, there can be no assurance that alternate suppliers will be available and able to manufacture our engine, generator or compressor on acceptable terms.\nFrom time to time, shipments can be delayed because of industry-wide or other shortages of necessary materials and components from third-party suppliers, as well as shipping delays at points of importation. A supplier's failure to supply components in a timely manner, or to supply components that meet our quality, quantity, or cost requirements, or our inability to obtain substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could impair our ability to deliver our products in accordance with contractual obligations.\nThe amount of Tecogen\u2019s backlog is subject to fluctuation due to its customers\u2019 experiencing unexpected delays in financing, permitting or modifications in specifications of the equipment.\nTecogen\u2019s total product and installation backlog as of December 31, 2016 was $11.1 million compared to $11.6 million as of December 31, 2015. Although Tecogen expects its customers to issue definitive purchase orders with respect to such backlog, there can be no assurance that such amounts will not be subject to modification in the event customers experience unexpected delays in obtaining permits, interconnection agreements or financing. Any of such events may result in customers modifying the equipment or the terms or timing of the expected installation, which may result in changes to the amount of backlog attributed to those projects.\nWe expect significant competition for our products and services.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors are well established and have substantially greater financial, research and development, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. If these larger competitors decide to focus on the development of distributed power or cogeneration, they have the manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities to complete research, development and commercialization of these products more quickly and effectively than we can. There can also be no assurance that current and future competitors will not develop new or enhanced technologies or more cost-effective systems, and therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this competitive environment.\nIf we are unable to maintain our technological expertise in design and manufacturing processes, we will not be able to successfully compete.\nWe believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to develop and provide innovative products and product enhancements that meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.\nTECOGEN INC.\nHowever, this requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in design and manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner. The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs, and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nThe introduction of products embodying new technologies, and the shifting of customer demands or changing industry standards, could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. We may experience delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the future. Material delays in introducing new products or product enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors.\nOur intellectual property may not be adequately protected.\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, and licensing arrangements, but we cannot ensure that we will be able to adequately protect our technology from misappropriation or infringement. We cannot ensure that our existing intellectual property rights will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or rendered unenforceable.\nOur competitors may successfully challenge the validity of our patents, design non-infringing products, or deliberately infringe our patents. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other similar technologies. In addition, our intellectual property rights may not provide a competitive advantage to us or ensure that our products and technology will be adequately covered by our patents and other intellectual property. Any of these factors or the expiration, termination, or invalidity of one or more of our patents may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOthers may assert that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights.\nWe may be subject to infringement claims in the future. The defense of any claims of infringement made against us by third parties could involve significant legal costs and require our management to divert time from our business operations. If we are unsuccessful in defending any claims of infringement, we may be forced to obtain licenses or to pay additional royalties to continue to use our technology. We may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or if these licenses are costly, our operating results would suffer either from reductions in revenues through our inability to serve customers or from increases in costs to license third-party technologies.\nOur success is dependent upon attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel and the loss of key personnel could significantly hurt our business.\nTo achieve success, we must attract and retain highly qualified technical, operational and executive employees. The loss of the services of key employees or an inability to attract, train and retain qualified and skilled employees, specifically engineering, operations, and business development personnel, could result in the loss of business or could otherwise negatively impact our ability to operate and grow our business successfully.\nOur business is subject to product liability and warranty claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims, which are inherent in the manufacturing, marketing and sale of our products, and we may face substantial liability for damages resulting from the faulty design or manufacture of products or improper use of products by end users. We currently maintain a moderate level of product liability insurance, but there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim. Also, we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that a product liability claim would not harm our business or financial condition. In addition, negative publicity in connection with the faulty design or manufacture of our products would adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.\nWe sell our products with warranties. There can be no assurance that the provision in our financial statements for estimated product warranty expense will be sufficient. We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability. Any significant occurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. Further, we have at times undertaken programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold. These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost. If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.\nTECOGEN INC.\nUtilities or governmental entities could hinder our entry into and growth in the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.\nUtilities or governmental entities on occasion have placed barriers to the installation of our products or their interconnection with the electric grid, and they may continue to do so. Utilities may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site CHP and rely on the grid for back-up power. These types of restrictions, fees, or charges could make it harder for customers to install our products or use them effectively, as well as increasing the cost to our potential customers. This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results.\nWe may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.\nWe believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products. Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low-cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts, and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur products involve a lengthy sales cycle and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.\nThe sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control. We expect to plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer. If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations. In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term. As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.\nThe economic viability of our projects depends on the price spread between fuel and electricity, and the variability of these prices creates a risk that our projects will not be economically viable and that potential customers will avoid such energy price risks.\nThe economic viability of our CHP products depends on the spread between natural gas fuel and electricity prices. Volatility in one component of the spread, such as the cost of natural gas and other fuels (e.g., propane or distillate oil), can be managed to some extent by means of futures contracts. However, the regional rates charged for both base load and peak electricity may decline periodically due to excess generating capacity or general economic recessions.\nOur products could become less competitive if electric rates were to fall substantially in the future, noting that historically the rates have not had any sustained decline in price. Also, potential customers may perceive the unpredictable swings in natural gas and electricity prices as an increased risk of investing in on-site CHP, and may decide not to purchase CHP products.\nWe are exposed to credit risks with respect to some of our customers.\nTo the extent our customers do not advance us sufficient funds to finance our costs during the execution phase of our contracts, we are exposed to the risk that they will be unable to accept delivery or that they will be unable to make payment at the time of delivery.\nWe may make acquisitions or take other corporate strategic actions that could harm our financial performance.\nTo expedite development of our corporate infrastructure, particularly with regard to equipment installation and service functions, we anticipate the future acquisition of complementary businesses. Risks associated with such acquisitions include the disruption of our existing operations, loss of key personnel in the acquired companies, dilution through the issuance of additional securities, assumptions of existing liabilities, and commitment to further operating expenses. If any or all of these problems actually occur, acquisitions could negatively impact our financial performance and future stock value.\nThe Company has also announced a number of corporate strategic actions, including a proposed all-stock acquisition of ADGE as well as transactions related to the Company's ownership interest in certain joint ventures. If the execution or implementation of these transactions is not successful, it could adversely impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nTECOGEN INC.\nRisks Relating to Tecogen's Proposed Acquisition of ADGE\nOn November 1, 2016, Tecogen and Tecogen.ADGE Acquisition Corp. (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tecogen formed for the purpose of the merger, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with ADGE. Tecogen\u2019s and ADGE\u2019s obligations to effect the Merger are subject to certain conditions, including that the Merger be approved by a vote of each of Tecogen\u2019s and ADGE\u2019s stockholders at separate special meetings of such stockholders. There is no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or that Tecogen\u2019s or ADGE\u2019s stockholders will approve such proposals.\nTecogen\u2019s obligations and the obligations of ADGE to complete the transaction are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. Tecogen\u2019s obligations and the obligations of American DG are each subject to, among other conditions: (i) approval of the Merger by the respective stockholders of ADGE and Tecogen, (ii) approval of the listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market of the shares of Tecogen common stock to be issued in the Merger, upon official notice of issuance, (iii) the effectiveness of Tecogen\u2019s Form S-4 registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (iv) the absence of any applicable law or order that prohibits completion of the transaction, (v) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement by Tecogen and ADGE, subject to certain materiality qualifications, and (vi) the performance in all material respects of the material obligations required to be performed by Tecogen and ADGE at or prior to the Merger effective time.\nThe satisfaction of the required conditions could delay the completion of the transaction for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the transaction could cause Tecogen or ADGE not to realize some or all of the benefits that Tecogen or ADGE expect to achieve if the transaction is successfully completed within its expected time frame. Further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the transaction will be completed.\nThe completion of the Merger is not conditioned on the receipt of an opinion of counsel to the effect that the transaction will qualify for the intended tax treatment, and neither Tecogen nor ADGE intends to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the transaction.\nIt is intended that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cintended tax treatment\u201d). However, the completion of the transaction is not conditioned on the transaction qualifying for the intended tax treatment or on the receipt of an opinion of counsel to that effect, and whether or not the transaction will qualify for the intended tax treatment depends on facts that will not be known until the transaction is completed. No assurance can be given that the transaction will qualify for the intended tax treatment. In addition, neither Tecogen nor ADGE intends to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the transaction. Accordingly, even if Tecogen and ADGE conclude that the transaction qualifies for the intended tax treatment, no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge that conclusion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge.\nIt will not be known at the time of the special meeting whether the requirements for the transaction to qualify for the intended tax treatment will be met.\nFailure to complete the transaction could negatively impact Tecogen\u2019s and ADGE\u2019s stock prices and Tecogen\u2019s and ADGE\u2019s future business and financial results.\nIf the transaction is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Tecogen\u2019s stockholders failing to approve the Merger, Tecogen\u2019s and ADGE\u2019s ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the transaction, Tecogen and ADGE would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nTecogen and ADGE may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the stock prices and debt instruments of Tecogen or ADGE;\n\u2022\nTecogen and ADGE may experience negative reactions from our respective customers and employees;\n\u2022\nTecogen and ADGE will be required to pay certain costs relating to the transaction, whether or not the transaction is completed;\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of Tecogen\u2019s and ADGE\u2019s businesses prior to completion of the transaction. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent Tecogen and ADGE from making certain acquisitions or taking other specified actions during the pendency of the transaction;\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the transaction (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by Tecogen\u2019s and ADGE\u2019s management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to either us or Tecogen as an independent company.\nFurther, Tecogen and ADGE could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the transaction or related to any proceeding commenced against Tecogen or ADGE to enforce performance of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the transaction is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect Tecogen\u2019s and ADGE\u2019s businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.\nTECOGEN INC.\nAlthough Tecogen expects that the transaction will result in synergies and other benefits to Tecogen, Tecogen may not realize those benefits because of difficulties related to integration, the realization of synergies, and other challenges.\nTecogen and ADGE have operated and, until completion of the transaction, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that the respective businesses can be combined in a manner that allows for the achievement of substantial benefits. It is possible that there could be loss of Tecogen\u2019s or ADGE\u2019s key employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall post-completion process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in combining Tecogen\u2019s and ADGE\u2019s operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction so the combined company performs as the parties hope:\n\u2022\ncombining the companies\u2019 corporate functions;\n\u2022\ncombining Tecogen\u2019s and ADGE\u2019s businesses in a manner that permits Tecogen to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the transaction, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the transaction not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nmaintaining existing agreements with customers, distributors, and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, and vendors;\n\u2022\ndetermining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nintegrating fully the companies\u2019 administrative and technology infrastructures; and\n\u2022\neffecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.\nIn addition, at times the attention of certain members of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 management and resources may be focused on completion of the transaction and integration planning of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company\u2019s ongoing business and the business of the combined company.\nThe transaction may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to Tecogen\u2019s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Tecogen\u2019s common stock.\nTecogen currently expects the transaction to be accretive to its adjusted earnings per share within 12 months after the completion of the transaction. This expectation, however, is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. In addition, Tecogen could fail to realize all the benefits anticipated in the transaction or experience delays or inefficiencies in realizing such benefits. Such factors could, combined with the issuance of shares of Tecogen common stock in the Merger, result in the transaction being dilutive to Tecogen\u2019s earnings per share, which could negatively affect the market price of shares of Tecogen\u2019s common stock.\nTecogen may incur substantial expenses related to the Merger.\nTecogen may incur substantial expenses in connection with consummating the Merger and integrating ADGE\u2019s business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures with its own. While Tecogen expects to incur a certain level of transaction and integration expenses, factors beyond Tecogen\u2019s control could affect the total amount or the timing of its integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. As a result, the transaction and integration expenses associated with the Merger could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that Tecogen expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the Merger.\nTECOGEN INC.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nInvestment in our Common Stock is subject to price fluctuations and market volatility.\nHistorically, valuations of many small companies have been highly volatile. The securities of many small companies have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations, unrelated to the operating performance or the prospects of such companies. The market price of shares of our Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nresults and timing of our product development;\n\u2022\nresults of the development of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors\u2019 operating results or changes in their growth rate;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management or personnel;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain, maintain, defend or enforce proprietary rights relating to our products and technologies;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of our Common Stock by us, our insiders, or our other stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our Common Stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could potentially harm our business.\nWe experience significant fluctuations in revenues from quarter to quarter on our product sales.\nWe have low volume, high dollar sales for projects that are generally non-recurring, and therefore our sales have fluctuated significantly from period to period. For example, when compared to the previous quarter, our revenues in 2016 increased in each consecutive quarter. In 2015, our revenues increased during the first quarter, remained relatively flat in the second quarter, decreased in the third quarter, and slightly increased in the forth quarter. Fluctuations cannot be predicted because they are affected by the purchasing decisions and timing requirements of our customers, which are unpredictable.\nWe may be subject to litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price may be volatile and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to an increased incidence of securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us, or provide favorable coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nTECOGEN INC.\nBecause our directors and executive officers are among our largest stockholders, they can exert influence over our business and affairs and have actual or potential interests that may depart from other stockholders or investors.\nAs of March 21, 2017, our directors and executive officers collectively beneficially own approximately 19.1% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Our directors and executive officers are entitled to cast an aggregate of approximately 3,522,833 votes on matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote or approximately 17.58% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast at a meeting of our stockholders. John Hatsopoulos, our co-Chief Executive Officer and a director, beneficially owns approximately 16.23% of our issued and outstanding common stock entitling him to cast an aggregate of approximately 3,252,395 votes on matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote or approximately 16.23% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast at a meeting of our stockholders. Additionally, the holdings of our directors and executive officers may increase in the future upon vesting or other maturation of exercise rights under any of the options or warrants they may hold or in the future be granted or if they otherwise acquire additional shares of our common stock. The interests of such persons may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. As a result, in addition to their board seats and offices, such persons will have influence over corporate actions requiring shareholder approval.\nSuch persons\u2019 stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to acquire us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nCurrent stockholdings may be diluted if we make future equity issuances or if outstanding warrants or options are exercised for shares of our common stock.\n\u201cDilution\u201d refers to the reduction in the voting effect and proportionate ownership interest of a given number of shares of common stock as the total number of shares increases. Our issuance of additional stock, convertible preferred stock and convertible debt may result in dilution to the interests of shareholders and may also result in the reduction of your stock price. The sale of a substantial number of shares into the market, or even the perception that sales could occur, could depress the price of the common stock. Also, the exercise of warrants and options may result in additional dilution.\nAs of December 31, 2016, an aggregate of 1,367,918 shares of common stock are issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants and options. The holders of outstanding warrants (and other convertible securities or derivatives, if any are subsequently issued) have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock, if any, without assuming the risk of ownership, with a resulting dilution in the interests of other stockholders. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital if it should be needed for our business while the options, warrants and convertible securities are outstanding. At any time at which the holders of the options, warrants or convertible securities might be expected to exercise or convert them, we would probably be able to obtain additional capital on terms more favorable than that provided by those securities.\nFuture sales of common stock by our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to fall.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate and thus inhibit our ability to raise additional capital when it is needed.\nBecause we have not and do not intend to pay cash dividends, our stockholders receive no current income from holding our stock.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. We currently expect to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying any cash dividends. In addition, the Company\u2019s outstanding convertible note provides that the Company shall not declare, pay or authorize any dividend without the prior consent of the note holder. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock could be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nFailure to comply with the Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirements could lead to the commencement of delisting proceedings in accordance the Nasdaq rules. Delisting could limit investors' ability to effect transactions in the Company's securities and subject the stock to additional trading restrictions.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, a national securities exchange. To maintain such listing, the Company is required to meet its continued listing requirements. If the Company is unable to maintain the listing of its stock on Nasdaq or another exchange for failure to comply with the continued listing requirements, including timely filing of Exchange Act reports and compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s corporate governance requirements, the Company and its security holders could face significant material adverse consequences including a limited availability of market quotations for its stock and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nTECOGEN INC.\nCertain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage mergers and other transactions.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us. These provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could delay or prevent someone from acquiring our business. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. The ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock is a traditional anti-takeover measure. This provision may be beneficial to our management and the board of directors in a hostile tender offer, and may have an adverse impact on stockholders who may want to participate in such tender offer, or who may want to replace some or all of the members of the board of directors.\nOur board of directors may issue additional shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, our board of directors may, without shareholder approval, issue one or more new series of preferred stock with rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging, an acquisition or change of control of us. Although we do not have any current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock, we may do so in the future.\nInvestor confidence in the price of our stock may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officers and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded there is a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nAs an SEC registrant, we are subject to the rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require us to include in our annual report on Form 10-K our management\u2019s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal control over financial reporting (\u201cmanagement\u2019s report\u201d). If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed by Section 404. Moreover, effective internal control over financial reporting, particularly that relating to revenue recognition, is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. Any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss in investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which ultimately could harm our business and could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Investor confidence and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, December 31, 2016, our principal executive officers and principal accounting officer performed an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that our controls were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by our Company in reports that we file under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as when required. Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016. The Company currently does not have personnel with a sufficient level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the selection, application and implementation of generally acceptable accounting principles as it relates to complex transactions and financial reporting requirements. The Company also has a small number of employees dealing with general controls over information technology security and user access. This constitutes a material weakness in financial reporting. Any failure to implement effective internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, and may require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control system.\nIn order to comply with public reporting requirements, we must continue to strengthen our financial systems and controls, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to provide timely and accurate financial statements.\nRefinement of our internal controls and procedures will be required as we manage future growth successfully and operate effectively as a public company. Such refinement of our internal controls, as well as compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related requirements, will be costly and will place a significant burden on management. We cannot assure you that measures already taken, or any future measures, will enable us to provide accurate and timely financial reports, particularly if we are unable to hire additional personnel in our accounting and financial department, or if we lose personnel in this area. Any failure to improve our internal controls or other problems with our financial systems or internal controls could result in delays or inaccuracies in reporting financial information, or non-compliance with SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements, any of which could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nTECOGEN INC.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations and reduces the amount of information provided by us in reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are and we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act.\nFor so long as we remain an emerging growth company we are not required to:\n\u2022\nhave an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\ncomply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u2022\nsubmit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder non-binding advisory votes;\n\u2022\nsubmit for shareholder approval golden parachute payments not previously approved; and\n\u2022\ndisclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and financial performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation to median employee compensation, when such disclosure requirements are adopted.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on some of these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile. If we avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and may result in less investor confidence.", "PERMNO": 14675, "SIC": 3621, "TIC": "TGEN"}
