RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report, including the risk factors set forth. The following is not an exhaustive discussion of all of the risks facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may impair our wind-down.\nRisks Related to Our Dissolution\nThere can be no assurances as to the amount of distributions, if any, to be made to our stockholders.\nWe filed for dissolution in January of 2021 and intend to use the dissolution process under Delaware law to liquidate our remaining assets, settle claims and, if available, make liquidating distributions of cash or other property to our stockholders. However, our dissolution and the liquidation of our remaining assets will be subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that there will be no additional liquidating distribution made to our stockholders.\nWe intend to rely on the \u201csafe harbor\u201d procedures under Sections 280 and 281(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) to, among other things, obtain an order from the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Court Order) establishing the amount and form of security for pending claims for which the Company is a party, contingent or unmatured contract claims for which the holder declined the Company\u2019s offer of a security, and unknown claims that, based on facts known to the Company, are likely to arise or become known within five years from the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution (or such longer period of time, not to exceed ten years, as the Delaware Court of Chancery may determine), and pay or make reasonable provision for our uncontested known claims and expenses and establish reserves for other claims as required by the Court Order and the DGCL. We expect to distribute all of our remaining assets in excess of the amount to be used by us to pay claims and fund the reserves required by the Court Order and pay our operating expenses through the completion of the dissolution and winding-down process to our stockholders. The Court Order will reflect the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s own determination as to the amount and form of security reasonably likely to be sufficient to provide compensation for all known, contingent and potential future claims against us. There can be no assurances that the Delaware Court of Chancery will not require us to withhold additional amounts in excess of the amounts that we believe are sufficient to satisfy our potential claims and liabilities. Accordingly, stockholders may not receive any distributions of our remaining assets, if any, for a substantial period of time.\nIn addition, there are numerous factors that could impact the amount of the reserves to be determined by the Court Order, and consequently the amount of cash initially available for distribution, if any, to our stockholders following the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution, including without limitation:\n\u2022whether any claim is resolved or barred pursuant to Section 280 of the DGCL;\n\u2022unanticipated costs relating to the defense, satisfaction or settlement of existing or future lawsuits or other claims threatened against us\u037e\n\u2022whether unforeseen claims are asserted against us, in which case we would have to defend or resolve such claims and/or be required to establish additional reserves to provide for such claims;\n\u2022the amount of time it will take us to liquidate all of our remaining non-cash assets, and the amount of any costs and expenses that may be incurred in connection therewith;\n\u2022the amount of cash collected from amounts due from previous asset sales, such as our sale of Noden to Stanley Capital;\n\u2022the time to complete any tax audits for tax years impacted by amounts claimed under the CARES Act;\n\u2022the value, if any, we are able to obtain for our remaining non-cash assets in our monetization process;\n\u2022whether our royalty assets, for the next couple of years, and afterwards if retained in a liquidation trust, continue to perform as expected; and\n\u2022whether any of the expenses incurred in the winding-down process, including expenses of required personnel and other operating expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees) necessary to dissolve and liquidate the Company, are more or less than our estimates.\nFurther, the amount of any distributable proceeds and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders depend on our ability to execute our monetization strategy for our remaining non-cash assets, which is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, as further discussed in other risk factors herein.\nIn addition, as we wind down, we will continue to incur costs to manage the remaining business, such as salaries and other employee compensation, rental payments, insurance, and taxes, contractual obligations to current and former employees (e.g., true-up payments to holders of stock options that vested prior to the filing for dissolution) and other legal, accounting, financial advisory and consultant fees, which will reduce any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we cannot assure you as to any amounts to be distributed to our stockholders in dissolution.\nLiquidating distributions to stockholders could be substantially reduced and/or delayed due to uncertainty regarding the resolution of potential tax claims, litigation matters and other unresolved contingent liabilities of the Company.\nWhether any remaining assets of the Company can be used to make liquidating distributions to stockholders would depend on whether claims for which we have set aside reserves are resolved or satisfied at amounts less than such reserves and whether a need has arisen to establish additional reserves. For example, we are subject to tax audits by the California Franchise Tax Board that have yet to be resolved, and the timing for resolution of such audits is uncertain. We cannot assure stockholders that our liabilities can be resolved for less than the amounts we have reserved, that unknown liabilities that have not been accounted for will not arise or the timing with respect to resolution of any such liabilities or claims. As a result, we may continue to hold back funds and delay additional liquidating distributions to stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the timing of the distributions to stockholders.\nUnder the DGCL, before a dissolved corporation may make any distribution to its stockholders, it must pay or make reasonable provision to pay all of its claims and obligations, including all contingent, conditional or unmatured contractual claims known to the corporation. The precise amount and timing of any distributions to our stockholders will depend on and could be delayed or diminished due to many factors, including without limitation:\n\u2022whether a claim is resolved for more than the amount of reserve established for such claim pursuant to the Court Order;\n\u2022whether we are unable to resolve claims with creditors or other third parties, or if such resolutions take longer than expected;\n\u2022whether a creditor or other third party seeks an injunction against the making of additional distributions to stockholders on the basis that the amounts to be distributed are needed to satisfy our liabilities or other obligations to the extent not previously reserved for;\n\u2022whether due to new facts and developments, new claims, as the Board reasonably determines, require additional funds to be reserved for their satisfaction; and\n\u2022whether the expenses we incur in the winding-down process, including expenses of personnel required and other expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees) necessary to dissolve and liquidate the Company are more than anticipated.\nAs a result of these and other factors, it might take significant time to resolve these matters, and as a result we are unable to predict the timing of distributions, if any, made to our stockholders.\nOur dissolution pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters, political crises, public health crises, and other events outside of our control.\nNatural disasters, such as adverse weather, fires, earthquakes, power shortages and outages, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability, or other conflict, criminal activities, public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other disease epidemics and pandemics, and other disruptions or events outside of our control could negatively affect our operations and our ability to monetize our remaining assets or realize the estimated value of our net assets in liquidation. Any of these events may cause a delay in our ability to make distributions in dissolution, and may materially impact the amount of cash or value of other non-cash assets available to distribute to our stockholders, if any.\nOur stockholders may be liable to our creditors for part or all of the amount received from us in our liquidating distributions if reserves are inadequate.\nIn dissolution we may establish a contingency reserve designed to satisfy any additional claims and obligations that may arise. Any contingency reserve may not be adequate to cover all of our claims and obligations. Under the DGCL, if we fail to create an adequate contingency reserve for payment of our expenses, claims and obligations, each stockholder could be held liable for payment to our creditors for claims brought during this three-year period after we filed the Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State, up to the lesser of (i) such stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of amounts owed to creditors in excess of the contingency reserve and (ii) the amounts previously received by such stockholder in dissolution from us and from any liquidating\ntrust or trusts. Accordingly, in such event, a stockholder could be required to return part or all of the distributions previously made to such stockholder in dissolution, and a stockholder could receive nothing from us under the Plan of Dissolution. Moreover, if a stockholder has paid taxes on amounts previously received, a repayment of all or a portion of such amounts received could result in a situation in which such repayment does not result in a commensurate refund of such taxes paid. As a result, while we intend to use the protections of DGCL Sections 280 and 281(a), including having a court order approve distributions, it is important for us to retain sufficient funds through our dissolution to pay the expenses and liabilities actually owed to our creditors because if we fail to do so, each stockholder could be held liable for the repayment to creditors out of the amounts previously distributed to such stockholder from us or from any liquidating trust or trusts, up to the full amount actually received by such stockholder in our dissolution.\nThe directors and officers of the Company will continue to receive benefits from the Company during the dissolution.\nDuring the dissolution, we will continue to indemnify each of our current and former directors and officers to the extent permitted under the DGCL and the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreements as in effect at the time of the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution.\nFurther stockholder approval will not be required in connection with the implementation of our Plan of Dissolution, including for the sale or disposition of any of our remaining assets.\nOur Plan of Dissolution provides that we may sell our remaining assets after dissolution, as necessary to affect our Plan of Dissolution. Under our Plan of Dissolution, we will not seek and are not required to seek additional stockholder authorization of any future asset sale. As a result, the Board may authorize actions in implementing the Plan of Dissolution, including the terms and prices for the sale or disposition of our remaining assets, with which our stockholders may not agree.\nOur common stock ceased to be traded at the time of our dissolution.\nWe closed our stock transfer books of our common stock after our dissolution became effective at approximately 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on January 4, 2021 (the \u201cFinal Record Date\u201d). Therefore, shares of our common stock are no longer freely transferable. As a result of the closing of the stock transfer books, all liquidating distributions from a liquidating trust, if any, or from us after the Final Record Date will be made pro rata to the stockholders of record as of the Final Record Date.\nWe have not and do not intend to record any assignments or transfers of our common stock after the Final Record Date, other than as required by will, intestate succession or operation of law. We have been informed that after the Final Record Date some shares of our common stock have been traded under contractual obligations between the seller and purchaser of the stock, who negotiate and rely on themselves with respect to the allocation of stockholder proceeds arising from ownership of the shares. We are not facilitating or participating in the trading in our common stock or interests in proceeds from our liquidation. Accordingly, trading in our stock is highly speculative and the market for our stock is highly illiquid. As we are no longer an operating company, the only value underlying the trading price of our shares is the right to receive further distributions, if any, as part of the liquidation process. Because of the difficulty in estimating the amount and timing of the liquidating distributions and due to the other risk factors discussed herein, the economic interests derived from our common stock may be subject to significant volatility and may trade above or below the amount of any future liquidating distribution that may be made.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to efficiently dissolve, liquidate and wind down.\nWe intend to rely on a few individuals in key management roles to dissolve, liquidate our remaining assets and wind-down operations. Loss of one or more of these key individuals could hamper the efficiency or effectiveness of these processes.\nOur remaining licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for their products, or to obtain regulatory approvals or favorable pricing for new products, and they may voluntarily remove products from marketing and commercial distribution. Any of such events, whether due to safety issues or other factors, could limit our revenues or return on investment. or our ability to generate expected returns from the monetization of such assets, including their sale, and reduce resulting distributions to our stockholders in dissolution.\nOur licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties are subject to stringent regulation with respect to product safety and efficacy by various international, federal, state and local authorities. Even if our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products receive regulatory approval, they will remain subject to ongoing FDA and other international regulations including, but not limited to, obligations to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing, changes to the product label, new or revised regulatory requirements for manufacturing practices, written advisements to physicians and/or a product recall or\nwithdrawal. Our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties may not maintain necessary regulatory approvals for their existing products. Moreover, the current political environment in the United States is focused on potential reductions in pricing for pharmaceutical and other healthcare products, which may negatively impact any existing or new products from which our revenues would be derived. We are unable to control the pricing strategies used by our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties, and if they fail to use appropriate pricing strategies, or receive negative reactions to their pricing strategies, it could negatively impact our revenues or return on investment.\nIn addition, communications from government officials regarding pricing for pharmaceutical and other health care products could have a negative impact on the value of the assets we intend to monetize, even if such communications do not ultimately impact our borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products. The occurrence of adverse events reported by any borrower or royalty-agreement counterparty may result in the revocation of regulatory approvals or decreased sales of the applicable product due to a change in physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe, or patients\u2019 willingness to use the applicable product. Our borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties could also choose to voluntarily remove licensed products from marketing and commercial distribution. Any value we may receive upon a potential transaction in furtherance of our monetization strategy in dissolution could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe value of our remaining income generating royalty assets may be dependent on the actions of unrelated third parties, which may negatively impact the value we are able to realize in dissolution.\nIn connection with our income generating assets, we are dependent, to a large extent, on third parties to enforce certain rights for our benefit. For example, Assertio (formerly Depomed), as the licensor of certain patents, retains various rights, including the contractual right to audit its licensees and to ensure those licensees are complying with the terms of the underlying license agreements. Assertio also retained full responsibility to protect and maintain the intellectual property rights underlying the licenses. While we have contractual rights to require Assertio to take action regarding certain of these rights, because Assertio\u2019s economic interest in the license agreements is limited, it may not enforce or protect those rights as it otherwise would have had it retained the full economic interest in the payments under the license agreements.\nOur royalty-agreement counterparties face significant market pressures with respect to their products, and the amount of revenues from their pharmaceutical products or medical devices, or from our income generating assets that we receive are subject to various competitive and market factors, including generic competitors, that may be outside of our control.\nOur royalty-agreement counterparties face competition from other pharmaceutical companies. The introduction of new competitive products, including generics, may result in lost market share for our royalty-agreement counterparties, reduced use of their products, lower prices and/or reduced sales, any of which could reduce our royalty revenues, and have a material adverse effect on any realized value we may obtain in connection with the evaluation of potential transactions to monetize such remaining assets in dissolution.\nThe amounts we are able to realize from any transaction in furtherance of our monetization of our remaining assets, and the amount of cash or other assets we are able to distribute our stockholders in dissolution, will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022the timing and availability of generic product competition for our royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022potential challenges or design-arounds to product, use or manufacturing related patents which provide exclusivity for products and assets before their expiration by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers;\n\u2022the size of the market for our royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022the extent and effectiveness of the sales and marketing and distribution support for our royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022the existence of novel or superior products to our royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022the availability of reduced pricing and discounts applicable to our royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022stocking and inventory management practices related to our royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022limitations on indications for which our royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products can be marketed; the competitive landscape for approved products and developing therapies that compete with royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022the ability of patients to be able to afford our royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or obtain healthcare coverage that covers those products;\n\u2022acceptance of, and ongoing satisfaction with, our royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products by the care providers, patients receiving therapy and third-party payors; or\n\u2022the unfavorable outcome (or potential thereof) of any litigation relating to our royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 business practices or products.\nFor example, in mid-2019, Bausch Health announced expected price decreases on Glumetza, a royalty-bearing product under our Assertio Royalty Agreement. These price decreases could negatively affect revenues and thus our royalties. Due to the uncertainties caused by changes in pricing by third parties that are outside our control, including as a result of generic competition, we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact on royalties on such sales paid to us for Glumetza or any other product.\nWe are also aware of a number of approved generic extended-release metformin products, which could further negatively affect Glumetza revenues.\nAny of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to realize significant value for our remaining royalty assets and negatively affect the amount of cash or other assets we are able to distribute to our stockholders in dissolution.\nRisks Related to Taxes\nWe may not be able to realize certain expected tax benefits.\nDuring 2020, we engaged in certain transactions that may result in the recognition of ordinary tax losses. Such losses, through provisions of the CARES Act, could generate meaningful tax benefits to the Company as the CARES Act permits taxpayers to carry back five years any net operating losses arising in a taxable year beginning in 2018, 2019 or 2020. In connection with our monetization process, we have executed transactions that result in ordinary tax losses that could be applied to prior tax years in which PDL was a substantial tax payor. There can be no assurance that such tax benefits will be realized as expected. For example, in February 2021, a letter was sent to congressional leaders signed by 120 members of Congress that proposed retroactively repealing the net operating loss carry back provisions of the CARES Act. If these provisions were retroactively repealed, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the amount of tax benefits that may be available to us under the current provisions of the CARES Act. Any failure to obtain such expected tax benefits under the CARES Act would likely reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders.\nU.S. Stockholders may not be able to recognize a loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes until they receive a final distribution from us.\nDistributions made pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution are intended to be treated as received by a U.S. stockholder in exchange for the U.S. stockholder\u2019s shares of our common stock. Accordingly, the amount of any such distribution allocable to a block of shares of our common stock owned by the U.S. stockholder will reduce the U.S. stockholder\u2019s tax basis in such shares, but not below zero. Any excess amount allocable to such shares will be taxable as capital gain. Such gain generally will be taxable as long-term capital gain if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any tax basis remaining in a share of our common stock following the final liquidating distribution by the Company will be treated as a capital loss. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences of our dissolution for them, including the applicability of any U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax laws.\nThe tax treatment of any liquidating distribution may vary from stockholder to stockholder.\nWe have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to the anticipated tax consequences of our complete dissolution and liquidation, and we will not seek an opinion of counsel with respect to the anticipated tax consequences of any liquidating distributions. If any of the anticipated tax consequences prove to be incorrect, the result could be increased taxation at the corporate or stockholder level, thus reducing the benefit to our stockholders and us from our dissolution and liquidation. Tax considerations applicable to particular stockholders may vary with and be contingent on the stockholder\u2019s individual circumstances. Stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors for tax advice on our dissolution and liquidation\u2019s impact on their taxes.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions or data corruption could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage all business activities and data, including accounting, financial and legal functions, asset management and business development. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power losses, computer system\nor data network failures, security breaches, data corruption and cyber-based attacks, including malicious software programs or other attacks, which have been attempted against us in the past. In addition, a variety of our software systems are cloud-based data management applications, hosted by third-party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks.\nThe failure to protect either our or our service providers\u2019 information technology infrastructure could disrupt our entire operation or result in our inability to manage and monetize our remaining assets, increased overhead costs, loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, intellectual property or sensitive or personal information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and affect the amount of cash or other assets we may be able to distribute to our stockholders in dissolution.", "PERMNO": 77292, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PDLI"}
