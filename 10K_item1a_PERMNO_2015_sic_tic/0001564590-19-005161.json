Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Part II, Item 7 entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and in any documents incorporated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K by reference, before deciding whether to invest in our Class A common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Although we have discussed all known material risks, the risks described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements. See also \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability. We will require additional financings to fund our operations.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with our lead product candidates, Bard and Omav, in clinical development. Pharmaceutical product development is a highly risky undertaking. To date, we have focused our efforts and most of our resources on developing our lead product candidates and on our earlier pipeline assets. We are not profitable and have only had net income in the year ended December 31, 2014, due to recognition of deferred collaboration revenue. Furthermore, other than in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2012, due to cash received from our collaborations with AbbVie and KHK, we have had negative cash flows from operations in each year since our inception. We have not generated any revenue based on product sales to date. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our net loss was $80.5 million, $47.7 million, and $6.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $420.3 million and capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $337.8 million. Despite cost coverage commitments from KHK and the potential to receive development cost sharing, milestone, and other payments from our collaborators, we anticipate that, without taking into account deferred revenue, we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. If we do not successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our existing or any future product candidates and effectively manufacture, market, and sell any products that are approved, we may never generate product sales, and even if we do generate product sales, we may never achieve or sustain profitability. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings, or continue our operations.\nWe believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future as we continue development and expand our clinical development efforts of our product candidates, seek regulatory approval and prepare for the commercialization of our product candidates, and pursue the development of additional molecules and treatment of additional indications. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, seeking regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions, and manufacturing and supplying products and product candidates for ourselves and our collaborators. The outcome of any clinical trial or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, and we are unable to fully estimate the actual costs necessary to successfully complete the development and regulatory approval process, or the likelihood of success, for our product candidates in development and any future product candidates. Our operating plans or third-party collaborations may change as a result of many factors, which are discussed in more detail below, and other factors that may not currently be known to us, and we therefore may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned through public or private offerings of securities, debt financings, or other sources. Such financings may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. We may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we currently believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe rate of progress in the development of and the conduct of clinical trials with respect to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of development efforts, including the conduct of clinical trials with respect to our lead product candidates, including the degree of participation by our collaborators;\n\u2022\nthe costs to initiate and continue research, preclinical, and clinical development efforts for any future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with identifying additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, if any, for our product candidates in the United States and other jurisdictions, and the costs of post-marketing studies that could be required by regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where approval is obtained;\n\u2022\nthe continuation of our existing third-party collaborations and entry into new third-party collaborations;\n\u2022\nthe time and unreimbursed costs necessary to commercialize products in territories where our product candidates may be approved for sale;\n\u2022\nthe revenue, if any, from any future sales of our products, if approved, as well as revenue earned from profit share, royalties, and milestones;\n\u2022\nthe level of reimbursement or third-party payor pricing available to our products, if approved;\n\u2022\nthe costs of obtaining third-party suppliers of our product candidates and products, if any, manufactured in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with being a public company;\n\u2022\nthe costs to grow our organization and increase the size of our facilities to meet our anticipated growth; and\n\u2022\nthe costs we incur in the filing, prosecution, maintenance, and defense of our patent portfolio and other intellectual property rights.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we require them or on terms that are acceptable to us. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our research and development efforts or other operations or activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates.\nSubstantially all of our recent revenue has been from collaboration arrangements for our product candidates under development.\nDuring the past three completed fiscal years, substantially all of our revenue was from our collaborators, including $26.6 million, $45.1 million, and $48.2 million under the AbbVie license and collaboration agreements and $24.7 million, $1.5 million, and $1.5 million under the KHK agreement, constituting 96%, 97%, and 100% of our revenue, for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Furthermore, this revenue consists of the recognition of deferred revenue from upfront, nonrefundable payments that we received from AbbVie and KHK in prior years and not from new collaboration payments.\nAbbVie is currently not participating in the development efforts for Bard or Omav. If AbbVie continues not to jointly develop and commercialize Bard or Omav, we could require significant additional capital to proceed with the commercialization of our product candidates. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis or on favorable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our efforts or other operations.\nIf we are unable to continue to advance our development efforts and achieve development milestones under our collaboration agreements due to disagreements, or, if our collaborations are reprioritized by us or our collaborators or are renegotiated, our revenue may decrease and our activities may fail to lead to commercial products.\nRevenue from research and development collaborations depends upon continuation of the collaborations, reimbursement of development costs from KHK, the achievement of milestones, and royalties and profits from our product sales, if any, derived from future products developed from our research. Collaboration agreements are often complex relationships intended to last for a long term; as a result, we may have disagreements, or our collaborations may be reprioritized by us or our collaborators or renegotiated from time to time to change economic and other terms. If we are unable to successfully advance the development of our product candidates or achieve milestones, or, if our collaboration agreements are renegotiated, we may not receive some or all of the revenue currently contemplated under our collaboration agreements. A significant portion of the milestone payments that could occur under our existing contractual arrangements arise from our KHK agreement.\nPayments under the instruments governing our indebtedness may reduce our working capital. In addition, a default under our Restated Loan Agreement could cause a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nIn June 2018, we entered into the Restated Loan Agreement, under which the Lenders agreed to lend us up to $125.0 million, issuable in two separate tranches of $80.0 million (Term A Loan) and $45.0 million (Term B Loan). In March 2017, we borrowed $20.0 million and, in June 2018, we borrowed the remaining $60.0 million from the Term A Loan. The Company may, at its sole discretion, borrow an additional $45.0 million under the Term B Loan, upon the achievement of one of two milestones by the earlier of 30 days after the achievement of a milestone or December 31, 2019.\nOur obligations under the Restated Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our current and future assets, including our owned intellectual property. All outstanding Term Loans will mature on June 1, 2023. We will make interest-only payments for 24 months through June 1, 2020; however, if we draw the Term B Loan, we will make interest-only payments for 36 months through June 1, 2021. The interest-only payment period will be followed by 36 equal monthly payments, or 24 equal monthly payments if we draw the Term B Loan, of principal and interest payments. Payments under the Restated Loan Agreement could result in a significant reduction of our working capital.\nThe Restated Loan Agreement requires us, and any debt arrangements we may enter into in the future may require us, to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness;\n\u2022\nencumber assets;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\ncomplete mergers or acquisitions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions to holders of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake specified investments; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with our affiliates.\nThese restrictions could inhibit our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we default under our obligations under the Restated Loan Agreement, the Lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our indebtedness or declare all obligation under the Restated Loan Agreement to be due and payable. In certain circumstances, procedures by the Lenders could result in a loss by us of all of our equipment and inventory, which are included in the collateral granted to the Lenders. If any indebtedness under the Restated Loan Agreement were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness. In addition, upon any distribution of assets pursuant to any liquidation, insolvency, dissolution, reorganization, or similar proceeding, the holders of secured indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full from the proceeds of the collateral securing our secured indebtedness before the holders of other indebtedness or our common stock will be entitled to receive any distribution with respect thereto.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidates, Bard and Omav.\nTo date, we have invested a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources in the research and development of Bard and Omav, which are currently our lead product candidates. These are our lead product candidates that have advanced into registrational clinical development, and it may be years before the trials required for their approval are completed, if ever. Our other clinical and preclinical programs are less advanced in development and may never enter into registrational clinical trials. Although we believe that Nrf2 activators have many potential clinical applications, we may fail to pursue successful indications and may miss opportunities for development in other indications as a result of limited resources. We also may fail to focus our efforts by attempting to develop single product candidates in multiple indications and formulations without success.\nOur near-term prospects are dependent upon successful interactions with global regulatory authorities and on successful registrational development and commercialization of Bard and Omav. We may need to complete larger and more extensive controlled clinical trials to validate the results observed in clinical trials to date to continue further development of these product candidates. In addition, although there may be many potentially promising indications beyond those we are currently investigating, we are still exploring indications for which further development of, and investment for, our lead product candidates may be appropriate. Accordingly, the costs and time to complete development and the related risks are currently unknown.\nThe clinical and commercial success of Bard and Omav will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe clinical and commercial success of Bard and Omav will depend on a number of factors, including the following, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nthe timely initiation, continuation, and completion of our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials for Bard and Omav, which will depend substantially upon requirements for such trials imposed by the FDA and other regulatory agencies and bodies;\n\u2022\nour ability to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of the relevant regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nwhether we are required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to conduct additional clinical trials, and the scope and nature of such clinical trials, prior to approval to market our products;\n\u2022\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, including pricing and reimbursement determinations;\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates for marketing and sale, if approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nour ability and the ability of third-party manufacturers to manufacture the quantities of our product candidates with quality attributes necessary to meet regulatory requirements and at a scale and yield sufficient to meet anticipated demand at a cost that allows us to achieve profitability;\n\u2022\nour success in educating health care providers and patients about the benefits, risks, administration, and use of our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance of our product candidates, if approved, as safe and effective by patients and the healthcare community;\n\u2022\nthe achievement and maintenance of compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our product candidates, our third-party manufacturers, and our internal operations;\n\u2022\nthe maintenance of an acceptable safety profile of our products, if any, following any approval;\n\u2022\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety, and relative efficacy of alternative and competitive treatments;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide approved product with a convenient and patient-friendly capsule configuration;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights for our product candidates and against the products of potential competitors; and\n\u2022\nour ability to avoid or succeed in third-party patent interference or patent infringement claims.\nWe cannot assure you that we will ever be able to achieve profitability through the sale of, or royalties from, our product candidates. If we or our collaborators are not successful in obtaining approval for and commercializing our product candidates, or are delayed in completing those efforts, our business and operations would be adversely affected.\nIf our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements and we may face future development, manufacturing, and regulatory difficulties.\nOur product candidates, if approved, will also be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, submission of safety and other post-market approval information, importation, and exportation. In addition, approved products, manufacturers, and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA, EMA, MHRA, Japanese PMDA, and Australian TGA requirements and the requirements of other similar agencies, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to CGMP requirements. As such, we and our potential future contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with CGMPs. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work will be required to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, EMA, PMDA, TGA, and other similar agencies and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our product candidates. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs also are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Accordingly, once approved, we may not promote our products, if any, for indications or uses for which they are not approved.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing, or labeling of a product, it may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nrequest voluntary product recalls;\n\u2022\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022\nrequire us or our potential future collaborators to enter into a consent decree or obtain a permanent injunction against us or our potential future collaborators, which can include shutdown of manufacturing facilities, imposition of fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, taking of specific actions by required due dates, and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\nimpose other administrative or judicial civil or criminal penalties or pursue criminal prosecution;\n\u2022\nwithdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or by our collaborators or potential collaborators;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products.\nSuccess in earlier Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for our product candidates, Bard and Omav, may not be indicative of the results that may be obtained in larger registrational clinical trials, which may delay or prevent obtaining regulatory approval.\nClinical development is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Success in preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results in larger clinical trials, and successful results from early or small clinical trials may not be replicated or show as favorable an outcome in larger clinical trials, even if successful. For example, we have previously endeavored to develop Bard for the treatment of T2D CKD. While Bard appeared to be safe and effective throughout Phase 2 clinical development for kidney disease, we encountered heart failure related to fluid overload during the pivotal Phase 3 trial, known as BEACON, that resulted in the termination of the T2D CKD program. Heart failure appeared to occur at a very low rate in only a particular type of patient studied during BEACON, which was not observed during Phase 2. Our other clinical programs with Bard and Omav have involved a relatively small number of patients exposed for a relatively short period of time compared to the Phase 3 clinical trials that we may need to conduct. Accordingly, the Phase 2 clinical trials that we have conducted may not have uncovered safety issues, even if they exist. The biochemical pathways that we believe are affected by Bard and Omav are implicated in a variety of biological processes and disease conditions, and it is possible that the use of our product candidates to treat larger numbers of patients will demonstrate unanticipated adverse effects, including possible drug-drug interactions, which may negatively affect their safety profile.\nIn addition, we cannot assure that any potential advantages that we believe Bard may have for our current clinical programs will be substantiated by our registrational clinical trials or that we will be able to include a discussion of any advantages in our labeling should we obtain approval. We cannot assure you that our previous data in our Phase 2 trial and our trials in T2D CKD may predict effects in our registrational trial in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, ADPKD, or other forms of CKD. In addition, based on the data from our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in PAH, we believe that Bard, combined with current standard of care, may have benefits compared to treatment with current standard of care. However, our belief that Bard may offer those benefits is based on a limited amount of data from our Phase 2 trial and our understanding of the likely mechanisms of action for Bard, and such data may not be replicated in our Phase 3 trial. Additionally, we have discussed the PAH and CKD caused by Alport syndrome trial data with the FDA, EMA and the PMDA and ADPKD trial data with the FDA. Preliminary discussions with the EMA have indicated that additional discussion will be needed and additional nonclinical and clinical studies may be required in advance of a MAA for CKD caused by Alport syndrome in that territory. We have had limited or no discussions of these trial data with other global regulatory health authorities, and these regulatory bodies may not concur that these studies would be adequate to support a marketing application or that the benefits would translate to approvable trial endpoints or be reflected on our product label.\nIn addition, we cannot assure that the potential advantages that we believe Omav may have will be substantiated by our registrational clinical trials or that we will be able to include a discussion of such advantages in our labeling should we obtain approval. Additionally, we have discussed FA and melanoma trial data with the FDA and FA with the EMA. Preliminary discussions with the EMA have indicated that additional discussion will be needed and additional nonclinical or clinical studies may be required in advance of a MAA for FA in that territory. We have had limited or no discussions of these data with other global regulatory health authorities, and these regulatory bodies may not concur that these studies would be adequate to support a marketing application or that the benefits would translate to approvable trial endpoints or be reflected on our product label.\nMany companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early stage development, and we have had, and may face, similar setbacks. In addition, the patient populations under investigation with Bard and Omav have many co-morbidities that may cause severe illness or death, which may be attributed to Bard and Omav in a manner that negatively affects the safety profile of our product candidate. If the results of our ongoing or future clinical trials for Bard and Omav are inconclusive with respect to efficacy, if we do not meet our clinical endpoints with statistical significance, or if there are unanticipated safety concerns or AEs that emerge during clinical trials, we may be prevented from or delayed in obtaining marketing approval, and even if we obtain marketing approval, any sales may suffer.\nWe may face delays in completing our ongoing or planned clinical trials with Bard and Omav due to a number of factors, or these studies may not be completed at all.\nClinical trials can be delayed, suspended, or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:\n\u2022\nreach timely agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nmanufacture sufficient quantities of product candidate with acceptable quality attributes for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtain required regulatory or IRB approval or guidance;\n\u2022\nmaintain clinical sites in compliance with clinical trial protocols and GCP;\n\u2022\ninitiate or add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nrecruit, enroll, and retain patients through the completion of the trial; and\n\u2022\naddress any physician or patient safety concerns that arise during the course of the trial.\nIn addition, we could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the relevant IRBs at the sites at which such studies are being conducted, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. A suspension or termination of clinical trials, including imposition of a clinical hold, may result from any number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, changes in laws or regulations, or a principal investigator\u2019s determination that an SAE could be related to our product candidates. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase the costs of the trial, delay or prevent the product candidate\u2019s development and approval, and jeopardize our ability to commence marketing and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may materially and adversely harm our business and operations and prospects.\nOur product candidates may cause or have attributed to them undesirable side effects or have other properties that delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit their commercial potential.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates or that may be identified as related to our product candidates by investigators conducting our clinical trials or even related to competing products in development that utilize a similar mechanism of action or act through a similar biological disease pathway could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and potential product liability claims. AEs and SAEs that emerge during treatment with our product candidates or other compounds acting through similar biological pathways may be deemed to be related to our product candidate. This may require longer and more extensive Phase 3 clinical development, or regulatory authorities may increase the amount of data and information required to approve, market, or maintain our product candidates and could result in negative labeling or a restrictive REMS. This may also result in an inability to obtain approval of our product candidates.\nThe occurrence of any or all of these events may cause the development of our product candidates to be delayed or terminated, which could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects. Our product candidates have in the past and may in the future be deemed to cause adverse effects and SAEs.\nClinical trials of our product candidates may not uncover all possible adverse effects that patients may experience.\nClinical trials are conducted in representative samples of the potential patient population, which may have significant variability. By design, clinical trials are based on a limited number of subjects and are of limited duration of exposure to the product, to determine whether the product candidate demonstrates the substantial evidence of efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval. As with the results of any statistical sampling, we cannot be sure that all side effects of our product candidates may be uncovered. It may be the case that only with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the product candidate for a longer duration may a more complete safety profile be identified. Further, even larger clinical trials may not identify rare SAEs, and the duration of such\nstudies may not be sufficient to identify when those events may occur. Other products have been approved by the regulatory authorities for which safety concerns have been uncovered following approval. Such safety concerns have led to labeling changes, restrictions on distribution through use of a REMS, or withdrawal of products from the market, and any of our product candidates may be subject to similar risks.\nAlthough to date we have not seen evidence of significant safety concerns with our product candidates in the patient populations currently undergoing clinical trials with Bard or Omav beyond those seen in BEACON, patients treated with our products, if approved, may experience previously unreported adverse reactions, and it is possible that the FDA or other regulatory authorities may ask for additional safety data as a condition of, or in connection with, our efforts to obtain approval of our product candidates. If safety problems occur or are identified after our products, if any, reach the market, we may make the decision or be required by regulatory authorities to amend the labeling of our products, recall our products, or even withdraw approval for our products.\nWe may fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials in a timely manner, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the rate at which we can recruit and enroll patients in testing our product candidates. Patients may be unwilling to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates for a variety of reasons, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nreal or perceived availability of alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nsize and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022\neligibility criteria for and design of the trial in question;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\nongoing clinical trials of potentially competitive agents;\n\u2022\nphysicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of our product candidates being studied in relation to available therapies or other products under development;\n\u2022\nour CROs\u2019 and our trial sites\u2019 efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u2022\nthe need to monitor patients and collect patient data adequately during and after treatment.\nPatients may be unwilling to participate in our clinical trials for Bard due to the SAEs or AEs we previously detected in a subset of patients with advanced T2D CKD, and patients currently controlling their disease with standard of care may be reluctant to participate in a clinical trial with an investigational drug. Likewise, patients may be unwilling to participate in our clinical trials for Bard and Omav due to unforeseen factors beyond our control. Some of the conditions that we are studying are rare diseases, and enrollment in clinical trials may be limited by the lack of suitable patients with these diseases. We may not be able to successfully initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot rapidly enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by regulatory agencies. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit, or terminate on-going or planned clinical trials, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nIf we, our collaborators, or our third-party manufacturers cannot manufacture our product candidates or products at sufficient yields, we may experience delays in development, regulatory approval, and commercialization.\nCompletion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture our product candidates at sufficient yields and at commercial scale. We have limited direct experience in manufacturing, or managing third parties in manufacturing, certain types of our\nproduct candidates in the volumes that are expected to be necessary to support commercialization. Our efforts to establish these capabilities may not meet our requirements as to scale-up, timeliness, yield, cost, or quality in compliance with CGMP. Our clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under applicable CGMP regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We, our collaborators, or our experienced third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production, which may include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ncosts and challenges associated with scale-up and attaining sufficient manufacturing yields;\n\u2022\nsupply chain issues, including the timely availability and shelf life requirements of raw materials and supplies and the lack of redundant and backup suppliers;\n\u2022\nquality control and assurance;\n\u2022\nshortages of qualified personnel and capital required to manufacture large quantities of product;\n\u2022\ncompeting capacity needs at CMOs supporting product development as quantities for supply increase;\n\u2022\nestablishment of commercial supply capacity through binding supply agreements;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements that vary in each country where a product might be sold;\n\u2022\ncapacity limitations and scheduling availability in contracted facilities; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, cyberattacks, or other force majeure events that affect facilities and possibly limit production or loss of product inventory maintained in third party storage facilities.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we cannot predict the labeling we will obtain, and it may be more narrow than originally sought.\nAlthough we are conducting three registrational trials, specific labeling language has not yet been discussed with regulatory authorities. For both Bard and Omav, regulatory approvals, if obtained at all, may include very narrowly-defined indications for which these products may be marketed, since this limitation is a common outcome of health authority review and approval processes. Alternatively, the specific labeling language could highlight real or potential perceived risks that could limit the use of the product candidates in the marketplace or require a REMS. These labeling limitations may be driven by either preclinical or clinical outcomes, some of which may not yet have been observed in our early studies. Such limitations or warnings may affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products. Due to the rarity of the diseases for which our product candidates are targeted, a narrower than expected indication or other restrictions in labeling could significantly affect our ability to generate revenue.\nWe have never completed a Phase 3 clinical trial or submitted an NDA, MAA, or other marketing applications and may be unable to do so efficiently or at all for Bard, Omav, or any product candidate we are developing or may develop in the future.\nWe have conducted, or are currently conducting, Phase 2 and Phase 3 or other registrational trials for Bard and Omav, and we may need to conduct additional Phase 2 trials before initiating additional Phase 3 or other registrational clinical trials with Bard and Omav. The conduct of Phase 3 trials and the submission of an NDA, MAA, or other marketing application is a complicated process. We have not previously completed a Phase 3 trial, have limited experience in preparing, submitting, and prosecuting regulatory filings, and have not previously submitted an NDA, MAA, or other marketing application. Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete necessary clinical trials and other requirements in a way that leads to the submission of an NDA, MAA, or other marketing application and approval of any product candidate we are developing. We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of product candidates that we develop. Risks related to the successful execution of our trials or successful filing of the NDA exist not only because of the complexity of the process, but also because of our lack of previous experience as an organization.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or fully-developed marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sales, marketing, or distribution of pharmaceutical products in any country. To achieve commercial success for any product for which we obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish sales and increase marketing capabilities or make and maintain our existing arrangements with third parties to perform these services at a level sufficient to support our commercialization efforts.\nTo the extent that we would undertake sales and marketing of any of our products directly, there are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products, if any, include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit, train, and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u2022\nour inability to effectively manage geographically dispersed sales and marketing teams;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nWith respect to Bard and Omav, we are currently dependent in part in certain territories on the commercialization capabilities of our collaborators, AbbVie and KHK. If our collaborators were to fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products, or in any way be unsuccessful in commercializing our products, if any, in their respective appropriate territories, our business and financial condition would suffer.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer. Because the target patient populations of our product candidates are small, we must be able to successfully identify patients and acquire a significant market share to achieve profitability and growth.\nWe focus our research and product development on treatments for rare and ultra-rare diseases. Given the small number of patients who have the diseases that we are targeting, our profitability and growth depend on successfully identifying patients with these rare and ultra-rare diseases. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on our beliefs and internal estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, and market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases, and, as a result, the number of patients with these diseases may turn out to be lower than expected. Our effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in early stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for each of our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Finally, even if we obtain significant market share for our product candidates, because the potential target populations are very small, we may never achieve profitability despite obtaining such significant market share.\nWe face substantial competition. There is a possibility that our competitors may discover and develop drugs and obtain regulatory approval before we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products is highly competitive. Our future success depends on our ability to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our objective is to discover, develop, and commercialize new products\nwith superior efficacy, convenience, tolerability, and safety in areas with unmet medical need. Our current development programs are intended to either significantly complement existing therapies or serve disease states for which there are no satisfactory existing products. However, we expect that in some cases, the products that we commercialize, if any, may compete with existing or future products of companies that have large, established commercial organizations.\nIf Bard is approved and launched commercially for patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, it will likely be the first treatment on the market for the indication. At least one therapy for the treatment of Alport syndrome is currently in clinical development with a Phase 2 injectable product candidate, lademirsen (RG-012), from Sanofi S.A. and Regulus Therapeutics Inc. Additionally, several inhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 protein, such as empagliflozin and dapagliflozin by Boehringer Ingelheim and Johnson and Johnson, are in development for inflammatory and inherited forms of CKD, and TRC101 is in development for the treatment of CKD patients with metabolic acidosis, a complication which may occur in patients with various forms of CKD, including some of the diseases for which we are developing Bard.\nIf Bard is approved and launched commercially for patients with ADPKD, it would launch into a landscape with one approved product and multiple products in commercial development. Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. received marketing authorization for tolvaptan (Jynarque) from the FDA in April 2018 for adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD. Multiple other therapies are reported to be in clinical development for ADPKD, such as tesevatinib, venglustat, and lixivaptan by Kadmon Holdings, Inc., Sanofi Genzyme, and Palladio Biosciences, respectively.\nIf Bard is approved and launched commercially for patients with IgAN, T1D CKD, or FSGS, it could face competition. Other programs that are in clinical development for the treatment of IgAN include OMS-721, nefecon, sparsentan, LNP023, atacicept, APL-2, PBF-677, and cemdisiran by Omeros Corporation, Calliditas Therapeutics AB, Retrophin, Inc., Novartis AG, Merck KgaA, Apellis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Palobiofarma, and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc., respectively. In T1D CKD, we are aware of three ongoing, clinical-stage, development programs including GKT831, BI685509, and empagliflozin by GenKyoTex SA, Eli Lilly and Company, and Boehringer Ingelheim. Sparsentan, CCX140, CXA-10, DMX-200, voclosporin, PF-06730512, and abatacept are reported to be in clinical development for the treatment of FSGS by Retrophin, Inc., ChemoCentryx, Inc., Complexa, Inc., Dimerix Bioscience Ltd., Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer Inc., and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, respectively. These product candidates may be in competition with Bard for patient recruitment and enrollment for clinical trials and may be in competition with Bard if it is approved and launched commercially. Some of these product candidates may enter the market prior to Bard, and some of these product candidates could limit the market or level of reimbursement available for Bard if it is commercialized.\nIf Bard is approved and launched commercially for patients with CTD-PAH, it would launch into a product landscape of numerous approved therapeutics for PAH, including Opsumit\u00ae (macitentan), Adempas\u00ae (riociguat), Orenitram\u2122 (treprostinil), Letairis\u00ae (ambrisentan), Tracleer\u00ae (bosentan), Uptravi\u00ae (selexipag), and others. These agents, used alone or in combination, currently comprise the standard of care in the treatment of patients with PAH. While we expect our anticipated product profile would be complementary to these therapies, and would add to, rather than attempt to displace, these products, it may be difficult to encourage treatment providers and patients to add our product to their treatment paradigm. We may also face competition from potential new therapies currently in clinical development. For example, ralinepag, GS-4997, BIA-5-1058, and KAR5585 are purported to be in development by such companies as Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Bial-Portela & Ca., SA, and Karos Pharmaceuticals, Inc., respectively. These product candidates may be in competition with Bard for patient recruitment and enrollment for clinical trials and may be in competition with Bard if it is approved and launched commercially. Some of these product candidates may enter the market prior to Bard, and some of these product candidates could limit the market or level of reimbursement available for Bard if it is commercialized.\nOmav may face similar competitive risks as Bard. For our development program in FA, if Omav is approved and launched commercially it may face market competition. Although there are no currently approved therapies for these conditions, there are several competitors who purport to be developing products in this space, including TAK-831, RT001, epicatechin, JOT101, and vatiquinone. These candidates are being developed by such companies as Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Retrotope Inc., Cardero Therapeutics Inc., Jupiter Orphan Therapeutics, Inc., and BioElectron Technology Corporation, respectively. These product candidates may be in competition with Omav for patient recruitment and enrollment for clinical trials and may be in competition with Omav if it is approved and launched commercially. Some of these product candidates may enter the market prior to Omav, and some of these product candidates could limit the market or level of reimbursement available for Omav if it is commercialized.\nRTA 901 may face similar competitive risks as Bard and Omav. Other HSP90 inhibitors are being developed for neurological indications, including arimoclomol and PUH-AD by such companies as Orphazyme AS and Samus Therapeutics Inc.\nRTA 1701 may face similar competitive risks as Bard, Omav, and RTA 901. Other RORgT modulators are in various stages of clinical development, including BOS172767, JTE451, AZD0284, JNJ3534, and others. These candidates are being developed by such companies as Boston Pharmaceuticals, Japan Tobacco Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Aurigene, Escalier Biosciences, BV, respectively.\nThe success of any of these potential competitive products may negatively affect the development and potential for success of our product candidates. In addition, any competitive products that are on the market or in development may compete with our product candidates for patient recruitment and enrollment for clinical trials or may force us to add or change our clinical trial comparators, whether placebo or active, to compare our product candidates against another drug, which may be the new standard of care.\nMoreover, many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, recruiting patients, manufacturing pharmaceutical products, and commercialization. Such large and established companies compete aggressively to maintain their market shares. In particular, these companies have greater experience and expertise in securing reimbursement, government contracts, and relationships with key opinion leaders; conducting testing and clinical trials; obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and distribution relationships to market products; and marketing approved products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in later stages of development. If we and our collaborators are not able to compete effectively against existing and potential competitors, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the health care community.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, these product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, third-party payors, patients, and others in the health care community. Market acceptance of any approved product depends on a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product is approved and the labeling required by regulatory authorities for use with the product, including any warnings, testing, and other qualifying criteria for patient use, that may be required in the labeling;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment and the willingness of physicians to prescribe new therapies and of the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u2022\nthe cost, safety, efficacy, and convenience of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe completion of any genetic tests that are required by the product labeling or third party payors and formulary committees;\n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications, if any;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate coverage and adequate reimbursement or pricing by third-party payors and government authorities; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued clinical testing, potential approval, and commercialization of our existing product candidates, the success of our business also depends upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Our research programs or licensing efforts may fail to yield additional product candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nour research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire, discover, or develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may not succeed in preclinical or clinical testing;\n\u2022\nour potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u2022\nproduct candidates we develop may be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022\nthe market for a product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community, or third-party payors.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nIt is difficult to predict the reimbursement or insurance coverage of our products, if approved. Failure to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement, or obtaining limited reimbursement, from third-party payors may render our products less attractive to patients and healthcare providers.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Market acceptance and sales of any approved products will depend significantly on obtaining adequate coverage and sufficient reimbursement of our products by third-party payors and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures or the prices of related products for which third-party reimbursement applies. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022\nsafe, effective, and medically necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient, including requiring genetic testing;\n\u2022\ncost-effective; and\n\u2022\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical, and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the third-party payor, which we may not be able to provide. Furthermore, the reimbursement policies of third-party payors may significantly change in a manner that renders our clinical data insufficient for adequate reimbursement or otherwise limits the successful marketing of our products. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such payor will pay for the drug product. Even if we obtain coverage for our product candidates, third-party payors may not establish adequate reimbursement amounts, which may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products, if any. Further, one payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our products, if any. Payors may also add additional requirements, including genetic testing and requiring less expensive generic therapy first. New laws may be enacted or regulations may be promulgated in the United States that decrease the price at which products, if approved, are sold. For example, there are proposals to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, allow drugs approved for sale in the United States to be purchased in Canada, and price certain drugs based on the average price of the drug in certain European countries.\nIn countries outside of the United States, price controls may limit the price at which products, if approved, are sold. For example, reference pricing is often used by various EU member states. Parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available products to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of our products, if any, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unacceptable levels, we or our collaborators may elect not to commercialize our products, if any, in such countries, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nthe demand for any products that may be approved for sale;\n\u2022\nthe price and profitability of our products;\n\u2022\ncoverage and reimbursement applicable to our products;\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully position and market any approved product; and\n\u2022\nthe taxes applicable to our pharmaceutical product revenue.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing, manufacturing, and commercialization of our product candidates. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in a product, negligence, strict liability, or breach of warranty. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we are unable to obtain insurance coverage at levels that are appropriate to maintain our business and operations, or if we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or otherwise cease operations. Product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ntermination of further development of unapproved product candidates or significantly reduced demand for any approved products;\n\u2022\nmaterial costs and expenses to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of time and resources across the entire organization, including our executive management;\n\u2022\nvoluntary product recalls, withdrawals, or labeling restrictions;\n\u2022\ntermination of our collaboration relationships or disputes with our collaborators; and\n\u2022\nreputational damage negatively affecting our other product candidates in development.\nWe maintain product liability insurance in a customary amount for the stage of development of our product candidates. We have product liability and clinical trial insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate to cover this risk. The amount of such insurance coverage may not be adequate, we may be unable to maintain such insurance, or we may not be able to obtain additional or replacement insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. Although we believe that we have sufficient coverage based on the advice of our third-party advisors, there can be no assurance that such levels will be sufficient for our needs. Moreover, our insurance policies have various exclusions, and we may be in a dispute with our carrier as to the extent and nature of our coverage, including whether we are covered under the applicable product liability policy. If we are not able to ensure coverage or are required to pay substantial amounts to settle or otherwise contest the claims for product liability, our business and operations would be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nIf our collaborators do not participate in the development and commercialization of our product candidates or prioritize other initiatives over their collaborations with us, our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates could suffer.\nWe have entered into an agreement with KHK with respect to the development and commercialization of Bard for renal, cardiovascular, diabetes, and certain related metabolic indications in certain territories in Asia. We have also entered into a license agreement with respect to the development and commercialization of Bard for renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular indications with AbbVie in certain territories outside the United States that are not covered by the KHK agreement. However, AbbVie is not currently participating in the development of Bard in CKD caused by Alport syndrome, ADPKD, CTD-PAH, or other rare kidney diseases, and KHK is not currently participating in the development of Bard in CTD-PAH, ADPKD, or other rare kidney diseases but is reimbursing us the majority of the costs for our registrational trial in CKD caused by Alport syndrome in Japan. Additionally, we have entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie with respect to the development and commercialization of Omav and other Nrf2 activator product candidates globally, and currently AbbVie is not participating in the development of Omav. These agreements contain various provisions related to cost-sharing of product development in certain instances and also provide for commercialization and revenue recognition terms for certain products throughout the major territories of the world.\nOur agreements with AbbVie and KHK provide them with certain rights and responsibilities related to participation in product development and commercial product supply of given products in specific territories. If AbbVie or KHK were to continue to elect not to participate in the development and commercialization of our product candidates or to determine that their collaborations with us are no longer a strategic priority, were unable to perform their obligations under the collaboration agreements, or if a successor were to reduce their level of commitment to their collaborations with us, our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates could suffer. In addition, some of our collaborations are exclusive and preclude us from entering into additional collaboration agreements with other parties in the area or field of exclusivity. AbbVie and KHK have allowed us to make regulatory filings and conduct clinical trials in its exclusive territory in order to generate clinical trial data that we may use in connection with seeking approval of our product candidates in the United States. There can be no assurance that one or more of these authorizations will not be withdrawn.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain strategic collaborations related to our product candidates, we could bear all of the risk and costs related to the development and commercialization of any such product candidate, and we may need to seek additional financing, hire additional employees, and otherwise develop expertise at our cost. This in turn may negatively affect the development of our other product candidates as we direct resources to our most advanced product candidates.\nConflicts with our collaborators could jeopardize our collaboration agreements and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nOur collaborator AbbVie has certain rights to control decisions and activity regarding the development or commercialization of various product candidates with respect to certain territories. If we have any disagreements with AbbVie with respect to those matters, our plans for obtaining approval may be revised and negatively affect the anticipated timing and potential for success of our product candidates. We have the right under our collaboration agreement with AbbVie to designate Omav as a product candidate for one indication and two related indications, and pursue further development of Omav in such indications, without AbbVie\u2019s consent. However, we are required to obtain AbbVie\u2019s consent to pursue the development of additional indications for Omav, once it is designated as a product candidate, which may not be obtainable. Even if Omav or another product candidate is approved, we may remain substantially dependent outside the United States on the commercialization strategy and efforts of our collaborator outside the United States, and our collaborator may not have experience in the areas we elect to pursue.\nWith respect to the AbbVie collaboration agreement, additional complexities exist. For example, if the agreement permits and AbbVie did opt back in to development of Omav, we and AbbVie must reach a consensus on our registrational development program with respect to jointly developed product candidates. Alternately, depending upon what point, if any, AbbVie opts back in, we could be responsible for commercializing Omav globally. Similarly, our collaboration with KHK for Bard requires cooperation between the parties, and failure to do so can negatively affect the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates or result in termination of the KHK agreement. Multi-party decision-making is complex and involves significant time and effort. There can be no assurance that the parties will cooperate or reach consensus, or that one or both of our collaborators will not ask to proceed independently in some or all of their respective territories or functional areas of responsibility in which the applicable collaborator would otherwise be obligated to cooperate with us. Any disputes or lack of cooperation with AbbVie or KHK may negatively affect the timing or success of our planned clinical trials or commercialization plans.\nCertain of our collaborators could also become our competitors in the future. If our collaborators develop competing products, or if we fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, or fail to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, the development and commercialization of our product candidates and products could be delayed.\nWe are also conducting proprietary research programs with molecules and programs that are not covered by our collaboration agreements. Our pursuit of such opportunities could result in conflicts with our collaborators in the event that they take the position that our internal activities overlap with those areas that are exclusive to our collaboration agreements, and we should be precluded from participating, or they should be permitted to participate, in such internal activities. Moreover, disagreements with our collaborators could develop over rights to our intellectual property. In addition, our collaboration agreements may have provisions that give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. Any conflict with our collaborators could delay collaborative activities, reduce our ability to renew agreements or obtain future collaboration agreements, result in termination of agreements, or result in litigation or arbitration and would negatively affect our relationship with existing collaborators.\nWe rely on third parties for the conduct of most of our preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, and if our third-party contractors do not properly and successfully perform their obligations under our agreements with them, we may not be able to obtain or may be delayed in receiving regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nWe rely heavily on universities, hospitals, and other institutions and third parties, including the principal investigators and their staff, to carry out our preclinical studies and clinical trials in accordance with our protocols and designs. We also rely on a number of third-party CROs to assist in undertaking, managing, monitoring, and executing our ongoing clinical trials. We expect to continue to rely on CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, and clinical investigators to conduct our development efforts in the future, including our Phase 3 development programs. We compete with many other companies for the resources of these third parties, and large pharmaceutical companies often have significantly more extensive agreements and relationships with such third-party providers, and such providers may prioritize the requirements of such large pharmaceutical companies over ours. The third parties upon whom we rely may terminate their engagements with us at any time, or we may terminate the engagements, which may cause delay in the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If any\nsuch third party terminates its engagement with us or fails to perform as agreed or if we terminate the engagement, we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements, or perform various functions ourselves, which could result in significant cost and delay to our product development program. Moreover, our agreements with such third parties generally do not provide assurances regarding employee turnover and availability, which may cause interruptions in the research on our product candidates by such third parties.\nWhile our reliance on these third parties for certain development and management activities will reduce our control over these activities, it will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require compliance with regulations and standards, including GCP requirements, for designing, conducting, monitoring, recording, analyzing, and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results from studies are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Although we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of these clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol under legal and regulatory requirements. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials prior to any marketing approval, if granted.\nWe cannot assure that, upon inspection by a regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP requirements. Similarly, we rely on certain CROs that conduct nonclinical studies, some of which must be conducted in compliance with GLP requirements for designing, conducting, monitoring, recording, analyzing, and reporting the results of such studies. If we or any of the CROs that perform nonclinical studies for us fail to comply with applicable GLP requirements, the data generated in those studies may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to repeat or to perform additional studies before an IND application becomes effective or prior to any marketing approval, if granted.\nIf CROs and other third parties do not successfully carry out their duties under their agreements with us, if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to trial protocols or to regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail to comply with regulations and trial protocols or meet expected standards or deadlines, the studies of our product candidates may not meet regulatory requirements. If studies do not meet regulatory requirements or if these third parties need to be replaced, the development of our product candidates may be delayed, suspended, or terminated, or the results may not be acceptable. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost, or at all.\nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct many aspects of our product candidate manufacturing activities, and we intend to rely on third parties for potential commercial product manufacturing. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not own any facility that may be used to conduct clinical-scale manufacturing and processing, and we must rely on collaborators and outside vendors to manufacture supplies and process our product candidates. We have not yet caused our product candidates to be manufactured or processed on a commercial scale and may not be able to do so for any of our product candidates. In addition, our anticipated reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to certain risks.\nIf a replacement contractor is needed, we may be unable to identify manufacturers, especially with acceptable terms, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. Additionally, the FDA or an equivalent foreign regulatory agency must evaluate any replacement contractor added after initial approval, and we must demonstrate comparability of product produced at any new manufacturer added after completion of Phase 3 clinical trials or initial product approval. This process would require additional development work, testing, and compliance inspections. A new manufacturer would also have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our product candidates and products, if any.\nOur third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely formulate and manufacture our product candidates or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any. Contract manufacturers may not be able to execute our manufacturing procedures and other logistical support requirements appropriately. Our contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed, may not devote sufficient resources to our product candidates, or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store, and distribute our products.\nManufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA or corresponding agencies in other geographic locations, to ensure strict compliance with CGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. Although we do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our product candidates are manufactured in accordance with CGMP.\nFailure of any third-party manufacturer to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in sanctions by the FDA, including request for a voluntary recall, warning letter, seizure of products, injunctions prohibiting some or all further sales and/or recalling product on the market, possible consent decree imposing substantial fines, preclusion of government contracts, import alerts, and criminal liability. In addition, failure of a third-party manufacturer for a product undergoing review by the FDA to maintain an acceptable CGMP compliance status could result in a decision by the FDA not to approve a pending NDA.\nWe may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our product candidates and products, if any. Our third-party manufacturers could misappropriate our proprietary technology, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nOur third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreements with us in a manner or at a time that may negatively affect our planned development and commercialization activities or the timelines for the achievement of development and commercialization activities.\nRaw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier, may not be available or may not be suitable or acceptable for use due to material or component defects. Our contract manufacturers and critical reagent suppliers may be subject to inclement weather, as well as natural or man-made disasters. Disruptions to the operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers unrelated to our product candidates could occur, including the bankruptcy of a manufacturer or supplier or a catastrophic event or another type of force majeure event affecting a manufacturer or supplier.\nEach of the risks discussed could delay our clinical trials, the approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA, or the commercialization of our product candidates, and could result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenue. In addition, we will rely on third parties to perform release tests on our product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not appropriately done and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm, and the FDA could place significant restrictions on our company until deficiencies are remedied to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction.\nOur product candidates and certain of the components of our product candidates are currently acquired from single-source suppliers and have been purchased without long-term supply agreements. The loss of any of these suppliers, or their failure to supply us with supplies of sufficient quantity and quality to obtain and complete manufacture of drug substance or finished drug product of acceptable quality at an acceptable price, would materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe do not have agreements with suppliers of drug substance, a drug product intermediate, or final drug product candidates. Additionally, we do not have agreements with suppliers of certain components of our product candidates. To date, we have used purchase orders for the supply of key materials that we use in our product candidates. We may be unable to enter into long-term commercial supply arrangements with our vendors or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business. In addition, we rely on our contract manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers some of the materials necessary to produce our product candidates. In certain instances, we do not have direct control over the acquisition of those materials by our contract manufacturers. Moreover, we do not have any agreements for the commercial production of those materials. If a key\nsupplier became unable to supply a key intermediate, the drug substance, or a key component, the lead time required to reinitiate supply source from the alternative suppliers presents risk of delay and potential shortages of supply of our product candidates. The logistics of our product candidate supply chains, which includes shipment of non-FDA regulated materials and intermediates from countries such as China, Japan, and Spain, adds additional time and risk to the manufacture of our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe rely on adequate protection of our proprietary technologies to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of intellectual property rights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and contractual arrangements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. We will only be able to protect our products and proprietary information and technology by preventing unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and contractual position allow us to do so. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our trade secrets or confidential information could compromise our competitive position. Moreover, we may in the future be involved in legal or administrative proceedings involving our intellectual property that are initiated by us or by third parties. As our product candidates continue in development, third parties may infringe or misappropriate, or attempt to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and proprietary information and technologies. In addition, third parties may accuse our product candidates of infringement of third party intellectual property. Any of these proceedings can result in significant costs and commitment of management time and attention.\nWe also may in the future be involved in initiating legal or administrative proceedings involving our intellectual property and the product candidates of our competitors. These proceedings can result in significant costs and commitment of management time and attention, and there can be no assurance that our efforts would be successful in preventing or limiting the ability of our competitors to market competing products.\nComposition-of-matter patents relating to the active pharmaceutical ingredient are generally considered to be the strongest form of patent protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection not limited to a particular method of use or formulation. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified purpose(s) or indication(s), and do not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Bard, Omav, and RTA 901 are protected by granted United States and foreign patents claiming compositions of matter and methods of use. RTA 1701 is protected by granted United States and foreign patents claiming compositions of matter. Each compound is the subject of pending United States and foreign patent applications claiming compositions of matter or methods of use. We rely on a combination of these and other types of patents to protect our product candidates, and there can be no assurance that our intellectual property will create and sustain the competitive position of our product candidates. We may choose not to file patent applications to protect certain technologies, and may also choose to allow certain patents or patent applications to lapse or expire based on cost-benefit considerations.\nPharmaceutical product patents involve highly complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Patent laws vary from country to country, and may change over time. In addition, the interpretation of patent law by the court systems in a country may change over time. This variability adds uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of our patents and the likelihood that our patent applications will result in granted patents. Pending patent applications that we own or license, and new applications filed by us or our licensors, may fail to result in issued patents. Third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our issued patents or patents resulting from our pending or future applications, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. Even if our patents and patent applications are not challenged by third parties, those patents and patent applications may not prevent others from designing around our claims and may not otherwise adequately protect our product candidates. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, competitors with significantly greater resources could threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Discoveries are generally published in the scientific literature well after their actual development. Patent applications in the United States and other countries are typically not published until 18 months after filing and in some cases are never published. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection covering such inventions. Subject to meeting other\nrequirements for patentability, for United States patent applications filed prior to March 16, 2013, the first to invent the claimed invention is entitled to receive patent protection for that invention while, outside the United States, the first to file a patent application encompassing the invention is entitled to patent protection for the invention. The United States moved to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), effective March 16, 2013. Effects of this change and other elements of the AIA are evolving, as the USPTO is still implementing associated regulations, and the applicability of the AIA and associated regulations to our patents and patent applications have not been fully determined. Creating further uncertainty, provisions under the AIA also include procedures for challenging issued patents and pending patent applications. We may become involved in opposition, inter partes review, or interference proceedings challenging our patents and patent applications or the patents and patent applications of others, and the outcome of any such proceedings are highly uncertain. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology and compete directly with us, or result in our inability to manufacture, develop, or commercialize our product candidates without infringing the patent rights of others.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by our patents. Although our agreements require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors, and any third parties who have access to our trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and other confidential information and technology to enter into appropriate confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and other confidential information and technology will not be subject to unauthorized disclosure or that our competitors will not otherwise gain access to or independently develop substantially equivalent trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and other information and technology. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property globally. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized disclosure of our intellectual property related to our product candidates and technology to third parties, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe may be involved in intellectual property disputes with third parties and competitors that could be costly and time consuming and negatively affect our competitive position.\nOur commercial success may depend on our avoiding infringement of the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties as well as on enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights against third parties. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology intellectual property disputes are characterized by complex, lengthy, and expensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights. We may initiate, become a party to, or be threatened with future litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and competing products.\nAs our product candidates advance toward commercialization, we or our collaborators may be subject to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims from third parties. We attempt to ensure that our product candidates do not infringe third-party patents and other proprietary rights. However, the patent landscape in competitive product areas is highly complex, and there may be patents of third parties of which we are unaware that may result in claims of infringement. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our product candidates do not infringe proprietary rights of third parties, and parties making claims against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could potentially block further efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Any litigation involving defense against claims of infringement, regardless of the merit of such claims, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management time.\nIf we succeed in commercializing one or more of our product candidates under United States law, the approved product would likely be considered a NCE and, if so, would benefit from a period of data exclusivity in which no competitor could receive marketing approval for a product containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient. Similar laws provide various periods of data exclusivity for new chemical entities in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions. Once the applicable period of regulatory exclusivity has expired, competitors may seek to market generic versions of our products even though issued patents protecting those products are still in force. In the event that a generic competitor seeks such approval, it may be necessary for us to take legal action to enforce our patents. In addition, the generic competitor may seek to invalidate our patents or to obtain a ruling of non-infringement in a\ncourt proceeding or by challenging our patents through interference, reexamination, inter partes review, and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO or through other comparable proceedings, such as oppositions or invalidation proceedings, before foreign patent offices. Any such resulting litigation or administrative proceedings would involve substantial expense, would be a substantial diversion of management time, and could create uncertainty regarding future sales of our products. Findings of invalidity or non-infringement with respect to our patents could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, third parties, including generic competitors or others, may initiate judicial or administrative proceedings in the United States and foreign jurisdictions to challenge our patents from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may consider initiating administrative proceedings and other means for challenging third-party patents and patent applications. Third parties may also challenge our patents and patent applications, through interference, reexamination, inter partes review, and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO, or through other comparable proceedings, such as oppositions or invalidation proceedings, before foreign patent offices. An unfavorable outcome in any such challenge could result in loss of patent protection for our technology or require us to cease using the related technology and to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing third party, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, in which case our business could be harmed. Even if we are successful, participation in administrative proceedings before the USPTO or a foreign patent office may result in substantial costs and time on the part of our management and other employees.\nFurthermore, there is a risk that any public announcements concerning the existence, status, or outcomes of intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings may adversely affect the price of our stock. If securities analysts or our investors interpret such existence, status, or outcomes as negative or otherwise creating uncertainty, our Class A common stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur reliance on third parties and our agreements with collaborators require us to share our trade secrets. Confidentiality agreements may not prevent a competitor from discovering, misappropriating, or disclosing them.\nOur reliance on third-party contractors to develop and manufacture our product candidates is based upon agreements that limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets and know-how. Despite the contractual provisions, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets and information are disclosed or used, even if unintentionally, in violation of these agreements. In the highly competitive markets in which our product candidates are expected to compete, protecting our trade secrets, including our strategies for addressing competing products, is imperative, and any unauthorized use or disclosure could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIn addition, our collaborators are larger, more complex organizations than ours, and the risk of inadvertent disclosure of our proprietary information may be increased despite their internal procedures and the contractual obligations in place with our collaborators. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, a competitor\u2019s discovery of such trade secrets and information could impair our competitive position and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our business.\nIn addition, while we require our employees or contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nWe have an extensive worldwide patent portfolio. The cost of maintaining our patent protection is high and requires continuous review and compliance. We may not be able to effectively maintain our intellectual property position throughout the major markets of the world.\nThe USPTO and foreign patent authorities require maintenance fees and payments as well as continued compliance with a number of procedural and documentary requirements. Non-compliance may result in abandonment or lapse of the subject patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance may result in reduced royalty payments for lack of patent coverage in a particular jurisdiction from our collaborators or may result in increased competition, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, certain strategic decisions in balancing costs and the potential protection afforded by the patent laws of certain countries. As a result, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries throughout the world or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other countries. Third parties may use our technologies in territories in which we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may infringe our patents in territories which provide ineffective or inadequate enforcement mechanisms, even if we have patent protection. Such third-party products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in securing and defending our intellectual property rights outside the United States.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain countries. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not always favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to pharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our patents, misappropriation of our trade secrets, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign countries could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and put our patents in these territories at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, or our patent applications at risk of not being granted, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in all legal or other proceedings that we may initiate and, if we were to prevail, the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIntellectual property rights do not prevent all potential threats to competitive advantages we may have.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage.\nThe following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nOthers may be able to make compounds that are the same as or similar to our current or future product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nWe or any of our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nWe or any of our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nThe prosecution of our pending patent applications may not result in granted patents;\n\u2022\nGranted patents that we own or have licensed may not cover our products or may be held not infringed, invalid, or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022\nWith respect to granted patents that we own or have licensed, especially patents that we either acquire or in-license, if certain information was withheld from or misrepresented to the patent examiner, such patents might be held to be unenforceable;\n\u2022\nPatent protection on our product candidates may expire before we are able to develop and commercialize the product or before we are able to recover our investment in the product;\n\u2022\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for such activities, as well as in countries in which we do not have patent rights, and may then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in markets where we intend to market our product candidates;\n\u2022\nWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022\nThe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and\n\u2022\nWe may choose not to file a patent application for certain technologies, trade secrets, or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nAdditionally, competitors could enter the market with generic versions of our product candidates, which may adversely affect sales of our product candidates, if approved. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may submit an ANDA seeking approval of a generic copy of an approved innovator product. A manufacturer may also submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA that references the FDA\u2019s finding of safety and effectiveness of a previously approved drug. An NDA product submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (a 505(b)(2) NDA) may be a new or improved version of the original innovator product. Innovative small molecule drugs may be eligible for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity (e.g., five years for new chemical entities, three years for changes to an approved drug requiring a new clinical trial, and seven years for orphan drugs), which precludes FDA approval of, or in some circumstances, the FDA filing and review of, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA relying on the FDA\u2019s finding of safety and effectiveness for the innovative drug. In addition to the benefits of regulatory exclusivity, an innovator NDA holder may have patents claiming the active ingredient, product formulation, or an approved use of the drug, which would be listed with the product in the FDA publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d also known as the Orange Book. If there are patents listed in the Orange Book, a generic applicant that seeks to market its product before expiration of the patents listed in the Orange Book must include in the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA what is known as a \u201cParagraph IV certification,\u201d challenging the validity or enforceability of, or claiming non-infringement of, the listed patent or patents. Notice of the certification must also be given to the innovator and, if within 45 days of receiving notice the innovator sues to protect its patents, approval of the ANDA will be stayed for 30 months or a longer or shorter period determined by the court.\nInnovator pharmaceutical patents are particularly vulnerable in the complex milieu of administrative, regulatory, and legal challenge. Specifically, a patent that might become or already is the subject of litigation related to Paragraph IV certification can be challenged by any party, such as a generic competitor, at the United States PTO in an inter partes review (IPR). If an IPR is instituted by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) at the United States PTO, a court could stay the litigation pending a decision by the United States PTO in the IPR because the decision could affect substantive and procedural aspects at trial. Under these circumstances, however, and some litigation to date indicates, a court may decline to toll the 30-month stay for ANDA approval when staying the litigation. Thus, for instance, a decision by the PTAB not reversed on any appeal and invalidating all relevant claims of a patent-in-suit, could prompt a generic competitor to motion for lifting of the litigation stay, and thereafter motion for summary judgement in the litigation before expiration of the 30-month stay.\nAccordingly, if our product candidates are approved, competitors could file ANDAs for generic versions of our product candidates that reference our product candidates. If there are patents listed for our product candidates in the Orange Book, those ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs would be required to include a certification as to each listed patent indicating whether the ANDA applicant does or does not intend to challenge the patent. We cannot predict whether any patents issuing from our pending patent applications will be eligible for listing in the Orange Book, how any generic competitor would address such patents, whether we would sue on any such patents, or the outcome of any such suit.\nWe may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for products and technologies we develop or license. Moreover, if any patents that are granted and listed in the Orange Book are successfully challenged by way of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent litigation, the affected product could more immediately face generic competition and its sales would likely decline materially. Should sales decline, we may have to write off a portion or all of the intangible assets associated with the affected product and our results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will need to obtain approval of any proposed product names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely affect our business.\nAny proprietary name or trademark we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA, and similar health authorities outside the United States, regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the USPTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product name if it believes the name inappropriately implies certain medical claims or contributes to an overstatement of efficacy. If the FDA objects to any product names we propose, we may be required to adopt an alternative name for our product candidates. If we adopt an alternative name, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties, and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nIf we do not obtain additional protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation extending the terms of our patents and obtaining data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA regulatory approval for our product candidates, one or more of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, is limited to a maximum of five years and cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval by the FDA. In addition, only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension.\nThe application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the USPTO, in conjunction with the FDA. It takes at least six months to obtain approval of the application for patent term extension. We may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened, our competitors may obtain earlier approval of competing products, and our ability to generate revenue could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property and other rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of intellectual property license agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, we may be required to make certain payments to the licensor, we may lose the exclusivity of our license, or the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market products covered by the license. Additionally, the milestone and other payments associated with these licenses will make it less profitable for us to develop our drug candidates. See \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property- Licenses\u201d for a description of our license agreements with Dartmouth, M.D. Anderson, and the University of Kansas, which include descriptions of the termination provisions of these agreements.\nDisputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our collaborators; and\n\u2022\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over intellectual property and other rights that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, and we may not obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe time required to obtain approval, if any, by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our current or future product candidates we may discover, in-license, or acquire and seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could be delayed in receiving or fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ninadequate design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022\nfailure of clinical trials to meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required for approval;\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nFDA refusal to accept efficacy results from clinical trial sites outside the United States where the standard of care is potentially different from that in the United States;\n\u2022\nthe insufficiency of data collected from preclinical studies and clinical trials of our present or future product candidates to support the submission and filing of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\ninadequate manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval;\n\u2022\nthe CROs that conduct clinical trials on our behalf may take actions outside of our control that materially adversely affect our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not perform or complete their activities contributing to our development programs in a timely manner or at all; or\n\u2022\none or more SAEs may be related or possibly related to one of our product candidates, and any such determination may adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval, whether or not the determination is correct.\nThe FDA or other regulatory authorities may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development program altogether. In addition, future shutdowns of the United States federal government may result in delays in the review or approval, if any, of our NDAs. Even if we do obtain regulatory approval, our product candidates may be approved for fewer or more limited indications than we request, approval may be contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or approval may require labeling that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. In addition, if our product candidates produce undesirable side effects or safety issues, the FDA may require the establishment of a REMS, or other regulatory authorities may require the establishment of a similar strategy, that may restrict distribution of our approved products, if any, and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nEven if we believe our current or planned clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may not agree that our completed clinical trials provide adequate data on safety or efficacy. Certain of our Phase 3 clinical trials are designed to permit us to file an application for accelerated approval based on positive interim data. Even if we believe the interim data will support an application for accelerated approval, the regulatory authorities may not agree, which could delay approval. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by any other regulatory authority. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. We may not be able to submit for regulatory approvals, and even if we submit, the applications may not be filed by the FDA or comparable regulatory agency, and we may not receive the necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market.\nWe may be unable to obtain orphan drug designations for some of our product candidates or to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation status, including market exclusivity, which may cause our revenue, if any, to be reduced.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the\nFDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In the EU, the EMA\u2019s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products may grant orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product. In the EU, orphan drug designation provides a range of potential incentives for medicines that have been granted an orphan designation by the European Commission, including protocol assistance, access to the centralized authorization procedure, 10 years of market exclusivity, and fee reductions.\nIf a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including an NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan product exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan product exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. A product may obtain orphan drug exclusivity for each indication that has been designated upon approval of the indication, subject to the qualifications above. Any orphan drug exclusivity granted for second or subsequent indications applies only to those subsequent indications and does not block approval of a product for the first indication once the initial period of exclusivity has expired. Moreover, even if one of our drug candidates receives orphan product exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease.\nWe have received orphan drug designation by the FDA for Bard for the treatment of CKD caused by Alport syndrome and for the treatment of PAH. We have also received orphan drug designation in Europe for Bard for the treatment of Alport syndrome. We have also received orphan drug designation by the FDA and in Europe for Omav for the treatment of FA. We may seek orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe for some of our other product candidates in specific orphan indications in which there is a medically plausible basis for the use of these products, including other rare kidney diseases. In the future, exclusive marketing rights in the United States, if granted, may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan drug designated indication and may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for the orphan drug designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. In addition, although we have sought or intend to seek orphan drug designation, we may never receive approval for such designations.\nWe may fail to obtain breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA or comparable accelerated development pathways from foreign regulatory authorities for some or all of our product candidates.\nIn 2012, the United States Congress established a breakthrough therapy designation, which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases when \u201cpreliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.\u201d The designation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and help to ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support approval, more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about such things as the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1, organizational commitment involving senior managers, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Breakthrough therapy designation does not change the standards for product approval.\nIf our product candidates obtain marketing approval, we will be subject to more extensive healthcare laws, regulation, and enforcement, and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we obtain approval for any of our product candidates, the regulatory requirements applicable to our operations, in particular our sales and marketing efforts, will increase significantly with respect to our operations. Also, the potential for civil and criminal enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments will increase with respect to the conduct of our business. The laws that may affect our operations in the United States, currently and in the future, include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims that are false or fraudulent to the federal government;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of entities, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal legislation commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members (information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives will also need to be reported);\n\u2022\nfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or which otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information relating to drug price increases; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and from HIPAA in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nOur clinical trial programs and research collaborations may implicate international data protection laws, including the GDPR in the EU. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018 and governs the collections and use of personal data in the EU. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several obligations and restrictions concerning the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EU, data breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data, and imposition of substantial potential fines or penalties for breaches or noncompliance of the data protection obligations. Data protection authorities from the different EU member states may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance, including the new risk of substantial financial penalties for data breach or improper processing of personal data under the GDPR. Failure by our collaborators to comply with the GDPR on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU into the United States may result in the imposition of criminal and administrative sanctions on such collaborators, which could adversely affect our business and could create liability for us.\nThe scope of these laws and our lack of experience in establishing the compliance programs necessary to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment increase the risks that we may violate the applicable laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and imprisonment, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nThe full effect of recent United States healthcare reform and other changes in the healthcare industry, laws, and regulations and in healthcare spending is currently unknown, and the reform and other changes may adversely affect our business model.\nThe commercial potential for our approved products, if any, could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry. New laws, regulations, or judicial decisions or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations, or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery, or payment for healthcare products and services could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition.\nFor example, the PPACA was enacted in 2010 with a goal, among others, of reducing the cost of healthcare and substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both government and private insurers. The PPACA, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs. The PPACA also created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the manufacturer\u2019s subsidy under this program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price, beginning in 2019. The PPACA also expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed in to law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of health care providers.\nIn addition, the Trump Administration has indicated an intent to address prescription drug pricing and recent Congressional hearings have brought increased public attention to the costs of prescription drugs. The Trump Administration has proposed a regulation intended to eliminate the rebate-oriented model used for pricing pharmaceutical products under Medicare Part D and Medicaid Managed Care, with the policy objective of lower costs to consumers. If this proposal is finalized, a similar approach might be adopted by commercial insurance plans as well. In addition, the Trump Administration has proposed to base drug payment under Medicare Part B on an index of prices for the drug in certain specified foreign countries, which are typically lower than priced in the United States. Numerous bills have been introduced in Congress by members of both parties seeking to reduce drug prices using a variety of approaches. These actions and the uncertainty about the future of the PPACA and healthcare laws are likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nIt is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and foreign governments will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation. For example, the PPACA has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented. More recently, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law, which eliminated certain requirements of the PPACA, including the individual mandate, and the current administration has further suggested that it may seek repeal of all or portions of the PPACA. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. In addition, our development and commercialization activities could be harmed or delayed by a shutdown of the United States government, including the FDA. For example, a prolonged shutdown may significantly delay the FDA\u2019s ability to timely review and process any submissions we have filed or may file or cause other regulatory delays, which could materially and adversely affect our business. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nthe demand for any products that may be approved for sale;\n\u2022\nthe price and profitability of our products;\n\u2022\ncoverage and reimbursement applicable to our products;\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully position and market any approved product; and\n\u2022\nthe taxes applicable to our pharmaceutical product revenue.\nWe are subject to United States and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations, which can harm our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the United States Export Administration Regulations, United States Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), the United States domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the United States Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States to sell our products abroad once we enter a commercialization phase and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could result in significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions, delays in clinical trials, or serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct for our directors, officers, and employees (the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct), but it is not always possible to\nidentify and deter employee misconduct. The precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, including through the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and also produce hazardous waste products. We contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes, but we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous, or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations in the United States and foreign countries. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development, or manufacturing efforts.\nWe are also subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local laws, including employment and labor laws, tax laws, and other regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties, or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we and any potential collaborators in those jurisdictions will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nprice controls on our drug products;\n\u2022\ndifferent standards of care in various countries that could complicate the evaluation of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndifferent United States and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent reimbursement systems and different competitive drugs indicated to treat the indications for which our product candidates are being developed;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by foreign distributors;\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from natural disasters or geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or systems failure including cybersecurity breaches; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with evolving and expansive international data privacy laws, such as the EU GDPR.\nFor example, in June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to voluntarily depart from the EU, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d, which is expected to occur in March 2019. As a result of the referendum, the British government has been negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the EU. We do not know to what extent Brexit will impact the business and regulatory environment in the U.K., the EU, or other countries. Changes impacting our ability to conduct business in the U.K., or other EU countries, or changes to the regulatory regime in those countries, may impact certain portions of our research and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU. However, we do not expect Brexit to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we seek to advance our product candidates through clinical trials and, if approved, through commercialization, we will likely need to expand our development, regulatory, quality assurance, manufacturing, commercialization, compliance, and administration capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to increase the responsibilities on members of management and manage any future growth effectively. Our failure to effectively manage our growth in this regard could prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy and maintaining the confidence of investors in our company.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key personnel, in particular our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer, we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates, conduct our clinical trials, and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are highly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer, Warren Huff, and our Chief Medical Officer, Colin Meyer. The loss of the services of Mr. Huff or Dr. Meyer could significantly negatively affect the development and commercialization of our product candidates, our existing collaborative relationships, and our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified commercial, development, scientific, clinical, and manufacturing personnel is and will continue to be critical to our success. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of, and commercialize product candidates. We may be unable to hire, train, retain, or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous companies for similar personnel. This may be particularly the case in the Dallas area, which does not possess as large a talent base of pharmaceutical professionals as that found in some other areas of the country.\nIf we are unable to continue to attract and retain personnel with the quality and experience applicable to our product candidates, our ability to pursue our strategy will be limited and our business and operations would be adversely affected.\nOur business and operations may be materially adversely affected in the event of computer system failures or security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and interrupt our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, loss of trade secrets or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including protected health information or personal data of employees or former employees, access to our clinical data, or disruption of the manufacturing process, we could incur liability, the further development of our drug candidates could be delayed, and we may be subject to regulatory actions, including fines or other penalties. We may also be vulnerable to cyber-attacks by hackers or other malfeasance. This type of breach of our cybersecurity may compromise our confidential information and/or our financial information and adversely affect our business or result in legal proceedings. Further, these cybersecurity breaches may inflict reputational harm upon us that may result in decreased market value and erode public trust.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, including a tornado, an earthquake, fire, or any other catastrophic event, could disrupt our operations or the operations of third parties who provide vital support functions to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe and the third-party service providers on which we depend for various support functions, such as data storage, are vulnerable to damage from catastrophic events, such as power loss, natural disasters, terrorism, and similar unforeseen events beyond our control. Our corporate offices and other facilities are located in the Dallas area, which in the past has experienced damaging storms including tornadoes. Natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage, or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our offices or other facilities, damaged critical infrastructure such as our data storage facilities, financial systems, or manufacturing resource planning and quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, parties in our supply chain may be operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen, and severe adverse events. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile, which may affect the value of your investment in our Class A common stock.\nOur IPO occurred in May 2016. Therefore, there has only been a public market for our Class A common stock for a short period of time. Although our Class A common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, an active trading market for our Class A common stock may not be sustained, and you may not be able to sell your shares quickly. Shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our IPO at $11.00 per share.\nIn August 2017, we closed a follow-on underwritten public offering of 3,737,500 shares of our Class A common stock at $31.00 per share. In November 2017, we entered into an at-the-market equity offering sales agreement with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, that established a program pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to $50.0 million of our Class A common stock from time to time in at-the-market transactions. No shares have been sold under this program. In July 2018, we closed on a follow-on underwritten public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our Class A common stock at $72.00 per share. Since our IPO in May 2016, our closing stock price has reached a high of $99.50 and a low of $11.03 through February 22, 2019.\nIn general, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences company stocks have been highly volatile in the current market. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences company stocks is sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and stocks often respond to trends and perceptions rather than financial performance. In particular, the market price of shares of our Class A common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors:\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the release of results of and regulatory updates regarding our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nsafety issues with respect to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our product candidates and any approved products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nadverse developments concerning our third-party collaborations and our manufacturers;\n\u2022\nthe termination of a third-party collaboration, significant difficulties with an established collaboration, or the inability to establish additional collaborations;\n\u2022\nthe publication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved drug product or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nthe ineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u2022\nour failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nannounced strategic decisions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation or other regulatory developments affecting our product candidates or our industry;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of the pharmaceutical industry and particular companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nsales of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock by us, our insiders, or our other stockholders;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022\nannouncements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nterrorist acts, acts of war, or periods of widespread civil unrest;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters such as earthquakes and other calamities;\n\u2022\nchanges in market conditions for pharmaceutical stocks;\n\u2022\nchanges in general market and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nAs a result of fluctuations caused by these and other factors, comparisons of our operating results across different periods may not be accurate indicators of our future performance. Any variances that we report in the future may differ from the expectations of market analysts and investors, which could cause the price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate significantly. Moreover, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and the existing ownership of capital stock by our executive officers and directors, together with their respective affiliates, have the effect of concentrating the voting power of our common stock and will limit your control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nEach share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share, and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to three votes per share. As of February 22, 2019, our executive officers and directors, together with their respective affiliates, collectively owned shares representing approximately 95.5% of our total Class B common stock, including shares subject to outstanding options that are exercisable within 60 days of such date, and approximately 18.7% of our total Class A common stock. Because of the greater number of votes per share attributed to our Class B common stock, our executive officers and directors, together with their respective affiliates, collectively beneficially own shares representing approximately 53.9% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nAccordingly, these stockholders will be able to exert control over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our board of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of those stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders, and they may vote their shares in a way that is contrary to the way other stockholders vote their shares. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of entrenching our management or the board of directors, delaying or preventing a change in our control, or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the market value of our Class A common stock. Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting on a 1 for 1 basis to Class A common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long-term, which may include our executive officers, directors, and affiliates.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and for so long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Specifically, the JOBS Act:\n\u2022\neliminates the requirement to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nremoves the requirement to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB;\n\u2022\nreduces disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nexempts us from the requirements of holding a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K is based upon the reduced reporting burdens under the JOBS Act, and we expect to continue reporting at these reduced levels for so long as we are permitted under the JOBS Act. Specifically, we could be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2021, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including any of the following: if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of June 30 in any calendar year before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the end of such year or, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. If any investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold, which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to drop significantly and impede our ability to raise future capital, even if our business is doing well.\nAs of February 22, 2019, we have 5,702,052 shares of Class B common stock outstanding representing 19.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock, all of which are currently restricted as a result of securities laws, but may be converted into shares of Class A common stock and sold, subject to any applicable volume limitations under federal securities laws with respect to affiliate sales, in the near future.\nAdditionally, our Seventh Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement dated as of November 10, 2010, entered into with certain of our investors in connection with our Series A through H preferred stock financings, provides certain registration rights for 4,744,362 shares of Class B common stock and 2,091,585 shares of Class A common stock as of February 22, 2019. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market.\nIn addition, as of February 22, 2019, there are approximately 4,224,053 shares subject to outstanding options to purchase Class B common stock that will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and Rule 144 under the Securities Act. We have registered all shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock that we issue under our employee benefit plans, including our Amended and Restated 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan. Once they are issued in accordance with the terms of the plans, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the restrictions imposed on our affiliates under Rule 144 and, in the case of Class B common stock, conversion to Class A common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock. If the market price of our Class A common stock is low, we may not be able to raise additional equity in amounts sufficient to fund our business plans or we may issue significant additional shares to raise funds, resulting in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and we devote substantial resources to public company compliance programs.\nAs a public company, and particularly after we cease to be an emerging growth company, we incur significant legal, insurance, accounting, and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in resources to comply with laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment will result in increased general and administrative expenses and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from product development activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. As a public company, it is more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nSpecifically, to comply with the requirements of being a public company, we are undertaking various actions, including implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring new accounting or internal audit staff. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the price of our Class A common stock could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The NASDAQ Global Market and could be subject to fines, sanctions, and other regulatory action, and potentially civil litigation.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This assessment includes the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we continue to dedicate internal resources and utilize outside consultants and continue to execute a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If material weaknesses are identified in the future or we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our reported financial results could be materially misstated, we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal controls over financial reporting from our accounting firm, if and when required, and we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources, which could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting in the future. For so long as we remain as an emerging growth company, our accounting firm will not be required to provide an opinion regarding our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders, and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and future prospects.\nWhile we have no specific plans to acquire any other businesses, we may, in the future, make acquisitions of, or investments in, companies that we believe have products or capabilities that are a strategic or commercial fit with our present or future product candidates and business or otherwise offer opportunities for our company. In connection with these acquisitions or investments, we may:\n\u2022\nissue stock that would dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership;\n\u2022\nincur debt and assume liabilities; and\n\u2022\nincur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs.\nWe may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete an acquisition, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen our competitive position or that it will be viewed positively by customers, financial markets, or investors. Furthermore, future acquisitions could pose numerous additional risks to our operations, including:\n\u2022\nproblems integrating the purchased business, products or technologies, or employees or other assets of the acquisition target;\n\u2022\nincreases to our expenses;\n\u2022\ndisclosed or undisclosed liabilities of the acquired asset or company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from their day-to-day responsibilities;\n\u2022\nreprioritization of our development programs and even cessation of development and commercialization of our current product candidates;\n\u2022\nharm to our operating results or financial condition;\n\u2022\nentrance into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired entity.\nWe may not be able to complete any acquisitions or effectively integrate the operations, products, or personnel gained through any such acquisition.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current directors or management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in control or changes in our management. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock, thereby depressing its market price. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our executive management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide for a dual class common stock structure, as a result of which our current Class B common stock holders, who also own a substantial number of shares of Class A common stock, will have control over matters requiring stockholder approval, including significant corporate transactions such as a merger;\n\u2022\nauthorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\ncreate a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed prior to the end of their term only for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nrequire a supermajority vote of the holders of our common stock or the majority vote of our board of directors to amend our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nrequire a supermajority vote of the holders of our common stock to amend the classification of our board of directors into three classes and to amend certain other provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law which may discourage, delay, or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who acquires in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting power without the prior approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting power, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our second amended and restated bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nBecause we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future, stockholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock for any return on their investment.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our Restated Loan Agreement preclude, and any future debt agreements may preclude, us from paying dividends. As a result, we expect that only appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock, if any, will provide a return to holders of our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and research and development credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs or Credits, to offset future taxable income or taxes. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation\u2019s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. Our existing NOLs or Credits may be subject to substantial limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs or Credits could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Our NOLs or Credits may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs or Credits. Furthermore, our ability to utilize our NOLs or Credits is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating United States federal and state taxable income. As described above under \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to our Financial Condition,\u201d we have incurred significant net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; and, therefore, we do not know whether or when we will generate the United States federal or state taxable income necessary to utilize our NOL or credit carryforwards that are subject to limitation by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (4) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine including any action to interpret, apply, or enforce our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to\nhave consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 16068, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RETA"}
