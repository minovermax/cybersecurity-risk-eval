{"cik": "1489979", "company": "Fresh Market, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations can be impacted by a number of risk factors, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock or other securities.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed merger.\nOn March 11, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Pomegranate Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cParent\u201d), and Pomegranate Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger Agreement provides for our acquisition by Parent in a two-step all cash transaction, consisting of a tender offer (the \u201cOffer\u201d), followed by a subsequent back-end merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The proposed Merger is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nUncertainties as to the timing of the Offer and the Merger;\n\u2022\nThe risk that the Offer or the Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nUncertainties as to the percentage of our stockholders tendering their shares in the Offer;\n\u2022\nThe possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals will be made;\n\u2022\nThe possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the Offer or the Merger may not be satisfied or waived, including the failure to receive any required regulatory approvals from any applicable governmental entities (or any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on such approvals);\n\u2022\nThe occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement, including in circumstances which would require us to pay a termination fee or other expenses;\n\u2022\nRisks regarding the failure to obtain the necessary financing to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nRisks related to the debt financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nThe effect of the announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on our ability to retain and hire key personnel, our ability to maintain relationships with our customers, suppliers and others with whom we do business, or our operating results and business generally;\n\u2022\nRisks related to diverting management\u2019s attention from our ongoing business operations; and\n\u2022\nThe risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability.\nIf the Merger is not consummated for any reason, our stockholders will not receive the consideration that Parent has agreed to pay upon the consummation of the Merger, and the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that its current market price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be consummated. Such decline may be significant.\nWe face intense competition in our industry, and our failure to compete successfully may have an adverse effect on our profitability and operating results.\nFood retail is a large and competitive industry. Our competition varies and includes national, regional and local conventional supermarkets, national superstores, alternative food retailers, natural foods stores, smaller specialty stores, and farmers\u2019 markets. Each of these stores competes with us on the basis of product selection and quality, customer service, store format, location and price, or a combination of these factors. Some of these competitors may have been in business longer or may have greater financial or marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing,\npromoting and selling their products. We have seen an increase in pricing pressure on our products and, due to overall competition from traditional supermarkets as well as other specialty retail stores, we may face continued pricing pressure on our products, which could have a material negative impact on our gross margin.\nSome competitors are aggressively expanding their number of stores or their product offerings, including within our core markets in the southeastern United States where competition in the past had been less intense. In their new or remodeled stores, our competitors often increase the space allocated to perishable food and specialty food categories, which are our core categories, and are lowering the prices of many of those items. If these competitors are able to offer perishable and specialty products comparable to those we sell, while also offering a wide range of traditional grocery and non-food items that we do not sell, customers may reduce the number of trips they make to our stores. In addition, if competitors offer lower prices than we do, and we do not make competitive price changes in response, consumers may perceive us as a higher-priced merchant and shop us only on \u201cspecial occasions,\u201d or not at all. Increased competition in proximity to our existing or future stores also may make obtaining suitable sites for new stores and employee retention more difficult and could raise our occupancy costs and our cost of hiring and retaining qualified employees.\nAs competition intensifies or competitors open stores within close proximity to our stores, our results of operations may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, reduction in margin from competitive price changes and greater operating costs, including increased marketing expense. Our response, or failure to respond effectively, to these competitive actions could adversely affect our profitability and operating results. Further, any attempt by a competitor to copy or mimic our smaller-box format or operating model could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition by causing a decrease in our market share and our sales and operating results.\nFailure to effectively execute or to realize the anticipated benefits of our announced strategic and financial review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOn October 20, 2015, we announced that we and our Board of Directors are conducting a strategic and financial review of our business. In conjunction with the strategic and financial review, we have developed a long-term plan and identified certain strategic actions and initiatives to increase customer transactions and engagement, including pricing, customer service, marketing, and shrink reduction initiatives. The cost associated with these initiatives may have an impact on our results of operations before any benefits are realized, and the effort involved in implementing such initiatives may affect other areas of the business. There is no guarantee that we will be able to effectively implement these initiatives on the anticipated timeline or at all, or that the initiatives will have the intended effect. The inability to successfully implement these initiatives, or failure to do so as timely as we anticipate, could impact or may harm our business and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur inability to improve levels of comparable store sales growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may not be able to improve the levels of comparable store sales growth that we have experienced in the past. In addition, our overall comparable store sales have fluctuated in the past and will likely fluctuate in the future. In fiscal 2015, our comparable store sales declined. A variety of factors affect comparable store sales, including consumer preferences, buying trends and spending levels, competition, economic conditions, product pricing and availability, in-store merchandising-related activities, consumer perceptions of our stores, the frequency with which consumers visit our stores, and our ability to source and distribute products efficiently. In addition, many specialty retailers have been unable to sustain high levels of comparable store sales growth during and after periods of substantial expansion. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to be materially lower than in past periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy on a timely basis or at all. Additionally, new stores may place a greater burden on our existing resources and adversely affect our existing business.\nOur continued growth depends, in large part, on our ability to open new stores and to operate those stores successfully. Successful implementation of this strategy depends upon, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe identification of suitable and available sites for store locations, including sites in new markets;\n\u2022\nthe negotiation of acceptable lease terms for store sites;\n\u2022\nthe ability to continue to attract customers to our stores largely through favorable word-of-mouth publicity, supplemented by targeted marketing activities;\n\u2022\nthe hiring, training and retention of skilled store personnel;\n\u2022\nthe identification and relocation of experienced store management personnel;\n\u2022\nthe effective management of inventory to meet the needs of our stores on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe availability of sufficient levels of cash flow or necessary financing to support our expansion; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully address competitive merchandising, distribution and other challenges encountered in connection with expansion into new geographic areas and markets.\nAlthough we have modified our real estate process, to include greater emphasis on existing markets, we may not be able to identify suitable and available sites to support our growth strategy. The sites that are identified may not produce the levels of sales we predict or that are necessary for a new store to operate profitably. Further, new store openings in markets where we have existing stores may result in reduced sales volumes at our existing stores in those markets.\nWe, or our third-party vendors, may not be able to adapt our distribution, management information and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores at competitive prices so that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner. We rely significantly on favorable word-of-mouth publicity to drive sales and we cannot assure you that we will continue to grow through new store openings or through favorable word-of-mouth publicity in the future. Additionally, store expansion over time into geographic areas in which we currently do not operate may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause us to operate our existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our existing stores. If we experience a decline in performance, or new stores or new markets do not meet our expectations, we may slow or discontinue store openings, or we may decide to close individual stores or exit a market, as we did in exiting the California market in March 2015. In the past fifteen years, we have closed nine stores before the expiration of their primary lease terms, three of which were closed during fiscal 2015 and four of which were closed during fiscal 2014, and all of which were in new markets outside our historical footprint. If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, including by opening new stores, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur new store base, or stores opened or acquired in the future, may negatively impact our financial results in the short term and may not achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our mature store base on a timely basis or at all.\nWe have actively pursued new store growth and plan to continue doing so in the future. Our growth continues to depend, in part, on our ability to open and operate new stores successfully. New stores may not achieve sustained sales and operating levels consistent with our mature store base on a timely basis or at all. This may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we acquire stores in the future, we may not be able to successfully integrate those stores into our existing store base and those stores may not be as profitable as our existing stores. We cannot assure you that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the Company. New stores build their sales volume and their customer base over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margin rates and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, than our more mature stores. New store openings may negatively impact our financial results in the short term due to the effect of pre-opening and applicable store management relocation costs and lower sales and contribution to overall profitability. In addition, our comparative results from one fiscal period to another may be impacted by the relative timing of new store openings within those fiscal periods. Any failure to successfully open and operate new stores in the time frames and at the costs estimated by us could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and result in a decline of the price of our common stock.\nAnother factor is our success in developing stores in new markets over time. There are inherent risks in opening new stores, especially in new markets, including the lack of experience, logistical support, and brand awareness. Some of our new stores may be located in areas where we have little or no brand recognition in local markets. Those markets may have different competitive and market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, as well as higher costs of entry, which may cause our new stores to be less successful than stores in existing markets. These factors may result in lower than anticipated sales and cash flow for stores in new markets along with higher pre-opening costs. In the event\nthat stores in new markets do not achieve the sales that we expect, we may expend additional resources through advertising, promotions or service offerings in order to improve sales performance. Further, if expected sales are not achieved and our efforts to increase sales and store profitability do not succeed, we may be forced to take an impairment charge, if future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group do not exceed the carrying value of that asset group, or close the underperforming store.\nOur inability to maintain or increase our operating margins could adversely affect our results of operations and the price of our stock.\nWe may not be able to maintain or increase our operating margins. If we are unable to successfully manage the potential difficulties associated with store growth, we may not be able to capture the scale efficiencies that we expect from expansion. If we are not able to capture scale efficiencies, improve our systems, continue our cost discipline and enhance our merchandise offerings, we may not be able to achieve our goals with respect to operating margins. In addition, if we do not adequately refine and improve our various ordering, tracking and allocation systems, we may not be able to increase sales and reduce inventory shrinkage. As a result, our operating margins may stagnate or decline, which could adversely affect the price of our stock. Further, strategic pricing changes or promotions may reduce operating margins if we are unsuccessful in increasing customer transactions and overall sales.\nWe are substantially dependent on a few key third-party vendors to provide logistical services for our stores, including services related to inventory replenishment and the storage and transportation of many of our products. A disruption in these relationships or a key distribution center, or a failure to renew or replace existing contractual relationships, may have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently rely upon independent third-party service providers for all product shipments to our stores. In particular, we rely on one third-party service provider, Burris Logistics, to provide key services related to inventory management, warehousing and transportation, and, as a result, much of the product is stored at warehouses maintained by Burris Logistics. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Sourcing and Distribution.\u201d Products sourced and distributed through Burris Logistics accounted for approximately 58% of the merchandise we purchased during fiscal 2015.\nThe provisions of our current agreement with Burris Logistics that relate to the distribution center that handles the majority of the products that are sourced for and distributed to us by Burris Logistics expire in August, 2017. We are pursuing multiple possible distribution arrangements, including renewing or extending our agreement with Burris Logistics. If we do not put alternative arrangements into place by August, 2017, we may not be able to renew or extend our agreement with Burris Logistics on favorable terms or at all. Although we have not experienced significant difficulty in our inventory management, warehousing and transportation to date with Burris Logistics, interruptions could occur as a result of the expiration of the current agreement or for other reasons in the future, including risks associated with a transition to a new provider. Further, although we expect that Burris Logistics, and our other key vendors, will have sufficient capacity to accommodate our anticipated growth, they may not have the resources to do so. Any significant disruptions in our relationship with Burris Logistics to service our stores prior to the end of the current term of our agreement, or significant disruptions in our relationships with our other key vendors, including due to their inability to accommodate our growth, would make it difficult for us to continue to operate our existing business or pursue our growth plans until we execute replacement agreements or develop and implement self-distribution processes. In addition, if our vendors fail to comply with transportation or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted.\nWhile we believe that other third-party service providers could provide similar services on reasonable terms, they are limited in number and we cannot assure you that we would be able to find a replacement distributor on a timely basis or that such distributor would be able to fulfill our demands on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also believe that other distribution strategies may be available, but any such strategies could require significant time to implement, and there is no assurance that such strategies would result in cost savings or adequate service levels. In addition, labor shortages in the transportation industry, long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure, reduction in capacity and industry-specific regulations such as hours-of-service rules that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business.\nEconomic conditions that impact consumer spending could materially affect our business.\nOngoing economic uncertainty continues to negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Our results of operations may be materially affected by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence\nand spending, including discretionary spending. This risk may be exacerbated if customers choose lower-cost alternatives to our product offerings in response to economic conditions, or if consumers perceive our stores as destinations for special occasions rather than regular shopping. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of consumer credit, interest rates, tax rates, and fuel and energy costs, could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors. In addition, inflation or deflation can impact our business. Food deflation could reduce sales growth and earnings, while food inflation, combined with reduced consumer spending, could reduce gross profit margins. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business could be harmed by a failure of our information technology, administrative or outsourcing systems, including a security breach.\nWe rely on our information technology, administrative and outsourcing systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes, such as our financial and reporting systems. The failure of our information technology, administrative or outsourcing systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business to suffer. In addition, our information technology, administrative and outsourcing systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, viruses and other malware, security breaches, including breaches of our transaction processing or other systems that could result in the compromise of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company data, and usage errors or other actions by an employee. Further, we process a large number of credit and debit card transactions each year. We may also collect and store personal information relating to our employees and customers. Such cardholder and personal information may be processed or stored by third parties, and we rely on those third parties to protect the security of such information in their possession or control. Third parties may also have access to our secured systems for business purposes. A security breach, whether of our systems or those of key third parties, may compromise the security of such systems, credit and debit card transactions, or personal information, as well as confidential or sensitive corporate information, and may continue undetected for a period of time, increasing the potential impact on such data. Due to the evolving nature of cyber security threats, the scope and impact of any incident cannot be predicted. While we actively manage information technology security risks within our control to protect against data security breaches, there can be no assurance that such breaches will not occur, be detected in a timely manner or be covered by insurance. Any such breach, damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, result in the disclosure of confidential, sensitive, or proprietary business information, cause us to face significant fines, customer notice obligations or costly litigation, harm our reputation with our customers, reduce customers\u2019 willingness to use credit and debit cards in our stores, require us to expend significant time and expense developing, maintaining or upgrading our information technology, administrative or outsourcing systems or prevent us from paying our suppliers or employees, receiving payments from our customers or performing other information technology, administrative or outsourcing services on a timely basis. Data security breaches are increasing in frequency and sophistication and breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting new federal and state laws and legislative proposals addressing data privacy and security, as well as increased data protection obligations imposed on merchants by credit card issuers. As a result, we may become subject to more extensive requirements to protect the financial and personal information that we handle, and incur significant compliance costs.\nWe may be unable to protect or maintain our intellectual property, including The Fresh Market trademark, which could result in customer confusion and adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our intellectual property has substantially contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered The Fresh Market, Experience the Food and TFM trademarks, are valuable assets that reinforce our customers\u2019 favorable perception of our stores.\nFrom time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from using such names and trademarks, the value of our registered trademarks may be diluted and customer confusion may result. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. The outcomes of these actions have included both negotiated out-of-court settlements and litigation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we evaluate the branding of our stores and products and how they are perceived by our customers. As part of this evaluation, we regularly develop new marks and explore using existing marks in new ways.\nWhether or not our The Fresh Market trademark rights are challenged in the future, we may decide (1) to continue to use The Fresh Market name and related design, (2) to use our other existing trademarks on a wider or different basis or (3) to develop new trademarks, which could also incorporate The Fresh Market name. If we undertake such an effort, we cannot assure you that it would be successful in strengthening our brand or improving our brand recognition or image to our customers. However, we believe that the strength of our business is driven by the distinct and superior food shopping experience we offer our customers. We therefore believe that we will be able to expand our business and pursue our growth strategy even if The Fresh Market trademark and related design mark are impaired.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify, source and market new products that meet our high standards and customer preferences and our ability to offer our customers an aesthetically pleasing shopping environment.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify, source and market new products that both meet our standards for quality and appeal to customers\u2019 preferences. Consumer preferences may change rapidly and without warning. A change in consumer preferences away from our offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business. A small number of our employees, including our in-house merchants, are primarily responsible for both sourcing products that meet our high specifications and identifying and responding to changing customer preferences. Failure to source and market such products, or to accurately forecast changing customer preferences, could lead to a decrease in the number of customer transactions at our stores and a decrease in the amount customers spend when they visit our stores. In addition, the sourcing of our products is dependent, in part, on our relationships with our vendors. If we are unable to maintain these relationships we may not be able to continue to source products at competitive prices that both meet our standards and appeal to our customers. We also attempt to create a pleasant and appealing shopping experience. If we are not successful in creating a pleasant and appealing shopping experience we may lose customers to our competitors. If we do not succeed in maintaining good relationships with our vendors and in introducing and sourcing new products that consumers want to buy, or if we are unable to provide a pleasant and appealing shopping environment or maintain our level of customer service, our sales, operating margins and market share may decrease, resulting in reduced profitability.\nOur stores rely heavily on sales of perishable products, and ordering errors or product supply disruptions may have an adverse effect on our profitability and operating results.\nWe have a significant focus on perishable products. Sales of perishable products accounted for approximately two-thirds of our total sales in fiscal 2015. We rely on various suppliers and vendors to provide and deliver our perishable product inventory on a continuous basis. We could suffer significant product inventory losses in the event of the loss of a major supplier or vendor, disruption of our distribution network, extended power outages, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences. We have implemented certain systems to ensure our ordering is in line with demand. We cannot assure you, however, that our ordering systems will always work efficiently, in particular in connection with the opening of new stores, which have no, or a limited, ordering history. If we were to over-order, we could suffer inventory losses, which would negatively impact our operating results, while under-ordering could leave us unable to meet consumer demand.\nIncreased commodity prices may impact profitability.\nMany of our products include inputs such as wheat, corn, oils, milk, sugar, cocoa and other commodities. Commodity prices worldwide may fluctuate widely. While commodity prices do not typically represent the substantial majority of our product costs, any increase in commodity prices may cause our vendors to seek price increases from us (including, for example, prices for proteins and the ingredients for prepared foods). Although we typically are able to resist vendor efforts to increase costs to us, we may be unable to continue to do so, either in whole or in part. In the event we are unable to resist our vendors\u2019 requests to obtain price increases, we may in turn consider raising our prices, and our customers may resist any such price increases. Our profitability may be impacted through increased costs to us which may impact gross margins or through reduced revenue as a result of a decline in the number and average size of customer transactions.\nThe current geographic concentration of our stores creates an exposure to local economies, regional downturns or severe weather or catastrophic occurrences that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of January 31, 2016, we operated 42 stores in Florida, making Florida our largest market and representing approximately 23% of our total stores. We also have store concentration in North Carolina, Virginia and Georgia, operating 22 stores, 14 stores, and 14 stores in those states, respectively. As a result, our business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and we are vulnerable to economic downturns in\nthose regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. These factors include, among other things, changes in demographics and population.\nSevere weather conditions and other catastrophic occurrences in areas in which we have stores or from which we obtain products may materially adversely affect our results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to our stores, loss of inventory, closure of one or more of our stores, inadequate work force in our markets, temporary disruption in the supply of products, delays in the delivery of goods to our stores and a reduction in the availability of products in our stores. Any of these factors may disrupt our businesses and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant lease obligations, which may require us to continue paying rent for store locations that we no longer operate.\nAll of our stores are leased and we are subject to risks associated with our current and future real estate leases for our stores. Our costs could increase because of changes in the real estate markets, entry into new, higher cost markets and supply or demand for real estate sites. We generally cannot cancel our leases, so if we decide to close or relocate a location, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the remaining lease term, and we may not be able to find acceptable assignees or sublessees for such locations. As each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or any terms at all and we may not be able to find replacement locations that will provide for the same success as current store locations.\nOur high level of fixed lease obligations could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur high level of fixed lease obligations will require us to use a portion of cash generated by our operations to satisfy these obligations, and could adversely impact our ability to obtain future financing, if required, to support our growth or other operational investments. We will require substantial cash flows from operations to make our payments under our leases, which generally provide for periodic increases in rent. If we are not able to make the required payments under the leases, the owners of the relevant properties may, among other things, repossess those assets, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations. In addition, our failure to make payments under certain leases could trigger defaults under agreements governing our indebtedness, which could cause the counterparties under those agreements to accelerate the obligations due thereunder.\nFuture consumer, employment or other litigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur retail operations are characterized by transactions involving a wide array of product selections, including prepared food. These operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in many other industries. Consequently, we have been, are, and may in the future become a party to individual personal injury, products liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. While these actions are generally routine in nature, incidental to the operation of our business and immaterial in scope, if our assessment of any action or actions should prove inaccurate, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we are occasionally exposed to industry-wide or class-action claims arising from the products we carry or industry-specific business practices. Products that we sell may carry claims, whether stated or implied, as to their origin, ingredients or health benefits, including, by way of example, the use of terms such as \u201cnatural.\u201d The use of these terms may not be subject to uniform standards. The resulting uncertainty has led to consumer confusion, distrust and legal challenges. Plaintiffs have commenced legal actions, including class actions, against a number of food companies, asserting claims for alleged false, misleading and deceptive advertising and labeling, including claims related to genetically modified ingredients. Should we become subject to similar claims, consumers may avoid purchasing products from us or seek alternatives, even if the basis for the claim is unfounded. Adverse publicity about these matters may discourage consumers from buying our products. Due to the nature of class action litigation, the cost of defending against any such claims could be significant. Any loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the truthfulness of our labeling or ingredient claims would be difficult and costly to overcome and may significantly reduce our brand value. Any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and brand and decrease our sales, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also have been, are, and may in the future become subject to claims for discrimination, harassment, wages and hours, and other federal and or/state employment matters, including claims that may be brought on behalf of a putative class of employees. For example, we are party to a lawsuit that was filed against us in U.S. District Court in Connecticut alleging that\nthe manner in which we previously implemented and applied the fluctuating workweek method for calculating overtime due to our department managers violated the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Certain claims asserted in such lawsuits, if resolved against us, could give rise to substantial damages. Our defense costs and any resulting damage awards or settlement amounts are not covered by insurance. Thus, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations in a particular period or periods.\nWe have recorded store asset impairment charges in the past and we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future.\nPursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we are required to recognize an impairment charge when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Our judgment regarding the existence of circumstances that indicate an asset\u2019s carrying value may not be recoverable, and therefore potentially impaired, is based on several factors, including a decision to close a store or negative or declining operating cash flows. If a determination is made that the asset\u2019s carrying value is not recoverable over its estimated useful life, the asset is written down to estimated fair value, if lower. We recognized impairment charges related to under-performing stores of approximately $5.6 million, $9.0 million and $26.8 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions concerning variables such as the potential impact of operational changes, competitive factors, inflation and the economy. Our estimate of fair value used in calculating an impairment loss is based on market values, if available, or our estimated future cash flow projections discounted to their present value. If these estimates or projections change, we may be required to record impairment charges on certain of these assets, which would negatively impact our results.\nChanges in accounting standards and estimates could materially impact our results of operations.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business, such as accounting for inventories, impairment of long-lived assets, insurance reserves, closed store reserves, leases, unclaimed property laws, income taxes and share-based compensation, are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying estimates, assumptions or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected earnings.\nAlso, new accounting guidance may require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs or change our financial statements. Implementing future accounting guidance related to leases and other areas may be impacted by the newly issued accounting pronouncements and standards.\nRisks associated with insurance plan claims and actuarial estimates could increase future expenses.\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liability, product liability, director and officers\u2019 liability, employee health care benefits, and other risks, including casualty and property risks. The liability for these claims has been determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, on an undiscounted basis. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect the level of reserves required and could cause material future expense to maintain reserves at appropriate levels.\nHealth care reform could adversely affect our business.\nOur expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. The Affordable Care Act requires employers to provide employees with insurance coverage that meets minimum eligibility and coverage requirements or face penalties. The legislation includes provisions that impact the number of individuals with insurance coverage, the types of coverage and the level of health benefits that are required and the amount of payment health care providers will receive. Our compliance with such provisions may increase our employee healthcare-related costs and therefore our operating expenses.\nEnergy costs are a significant component of our operating expenses and increasing energy costs, unless offset by more efficient usage or other operational responses, may impact our profitability.\nWe utilize natural gas, water, sewer and electricity in our stores and our third-party logistics providers use gasoline and diesel fuel in the trucks that deliver products to our stores. Increases in energy costs, whether driven by increased demand,\ndecreased or disrupted supply or an anticipation of any such events will increase the costs of operating our stores and may increase the costs of our products. We may not be able to recover such rising costs, should they occur, through increased prices charged to our customers, and any increased prices may exacerbate the risk of customers choosing lower-cost alternatives. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attempts to protect against increases in energy costs through energy contracts, improved energy procurement, improved efficiency and other operational improvements, the overall costs of operating our stores will increase, which would impact our profitability.\nProducts we sell could cause unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits, either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation.\nThere is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death caused by products we sell, whether food or non-food, could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or prevent us from achieving market acceptance of the affected products. Such side effects, illnesses, injuries and death could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits. In particular, the sale of food products entails an inherent risk of product liability claims, product recalls and the resulting negative publicity. Food products containing contaminants or allergens could be inadvertently manufactured, prepared or distributed by us and, if processing at the consumer level does not eliminate them, these contaminants or allergens could result in illness or death. We cannot assure you that product liability claims will not be asserted against us or that we will not be obligated to perform product recalls in the future, whether on food or other products. Any such claims, recalls or adverse publicity with respect to our private-label products may have an even greater negative effect on our sales and operating results, in addition to generating adverse publicity for our private-label brand.\nAny claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits, or not be covered by any rights to indemnity or contribution we have against others. Our insurance carriers may contest their coverage obligations. Any judgment against us that is in excess of our available insurance coverage would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. Further, we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment, in which case our creditors could levy against our assets. The real or perceived sale of contaminated or harmful products would cause negative publicity regarding the Company, or our brand or products, which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may experience negative effects to our reputation from real or perceived quality or health issues with our food products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe believe customers count on us to provide them with fresh, high-quality food products. Concerns regarding the quality or safety of our food products or our food supply chain could cause consumers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of food, even if the basis for the concern is unfounded, has been addressed or is outside of our control. Adverse publicity about these concerns, whether or not ultimately based on fact, and whether or not involving products sold at our stores, could discourage consumers from buying our products which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand and operating results.\nAny lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. Any such adverse effect could be exacerbated by our position in the market as a purveyor of fresh, high-quality food products and could significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any food items sold by us, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain our reputation and the value of our brand, our sales may decline.\nWe believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value of The Fresh Market brand. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity.\nThe occurrence of a widespread health epidemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be severely impacted by a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic, such as pandemic flu. Such an epidemic could materially adversely affect our business by disrupting production and delivery of\nproducts to our stores, by impacting our ability to appropriately staff our stores and by causing customers to avoid public gathering places, such as our stores, or otherwise change their shopping behaviors.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain employees, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business.\nThe food retail industry is labor intensive, and our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture, are mobile in order to support our growth, and are able to represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. Our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees in existing stores while also staffing new stores. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling wage and labor-related costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the workforce in the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, unionization of the available workforce, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages.\nIncreasingly, our wage and labor-related costs are potentially affected by federal, state, and local legislative or administrative actions. The U.S. Department of Labor has proposed regulations, expected to take effect during 2016, that would more than double the existing salary threshold for exempt status under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) and may, in addition, revise the requirements relating to the types of duties that exempt employees must perform. The effect of these changes, if they become effective, would be to raise the salary levels for certain positions at our stores, or to expand the number of employees who are entitled to overtime compensation under the FLSA. If we reduce labor hours in response, customer service in our stores may suffer. Furthermore, various movements have sought to increase retail employee wages, with some effect on minimum wage rates in certain localities, which may also cause wage rates above the minimum to increase in those markets. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image and our ability to pursue growth opportunities may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnion attempts to organize our employees could negatively affect our business.\nNone of our employees are currently subject to a collective bargaining agreement. As we continue to grow and enter different regions, unions may attempt to organize all or part of our employee base at certain stores or within certain regions. Responding to such organization attempts may distract management and employees and may have a negative financial impact on individual stores, or on our business as a whole.\nVarious aspects of our business are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our compliance with these laws and regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as planned.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to matters such as product labeling, weights and measures, zoning, land use, environmental protection, workplace safety, food safety, public health, and alcoholic beverage sales. States in which we operate and several local jurisdictions regulate the licensing of supermarkets and the sale of alcoholic beverages. In addition, certain local regulations may limit our ability to sell alcoholic beverages at certain times. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, benefits such as paid sick leave, immigration, disabled access and work permit requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies may impose additional regulations that raise the cost of operating our business or cause us to make changes to our operations. Such regulations may include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s proposed changes to the standards for exempt status under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s rulemaking regarding menu labeling and the various rules promulgated under the Food Safety Modernization Act, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s rulemaking on recordkeeping related to raw beef products ground in stores. In addition, state or local legislatures have passed or may pass laws regarding the labeling of products made with genetically modified organisms and other laws that would impact our operations, including but not limited to increasing the costs associated with our supply chain, packaging and labeling, employee compensation and benefits, and store operations. Compliance with new laws in these areas, or with new or stricter interpretations of existing requirements, could reduce the revenue and profitability of our stores and could otherwise\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Such changes in applicable law also may cause us to alter the types of products or services that we offer, or affect our ability to profitably operate stores in certain jurisdictions. Further, our new store openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. Our stores are subject to unscheduled inspections on a regular basis, which, if violations are found, could result in the assessment of fines, suspension of one or more needed licenses and, in the case of repeated \u201ccritical\u201d violations, closure of the store until a re-inspection demonstrates that we have remediated the problem. We cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our business in the future.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations.\nOur revolving credit facility contains, and any additional debt financing we may incur would likely contain, covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to grant liens, incur additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. A failure by us to comply with the covenants or financial ratios contained in our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies as set forth in our revolving credit facility. If the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility were to be accelerated, our future financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe will require significant capital to fund our expanding business, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all.\nTo support our expanding business and pursue our growth strategy, we will utilize significant amounts of cash generated by our operations to pay our lease obligations, build out new store space, purchase inventory, pay personnel, further invest in our infrastructure and facilities, and pay for the costs associated with operating as a public company. We primarily depend on cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund our business and growth plans. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund these activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us under our revolving credit facility, we may need additional equity or debt financing. If such financing is not available to us, or is not available to us on satisfactory terms, our ability to operate and expand our business or to respond to competitive pressures would be limited and we could be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate planned store openings or operations or other elements of our growth strategy.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes to our business.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Any increase in the amount of our indebtedness could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Our level of indebtedness has important consequences to you and your investment in our common stock.\nFor example, our level of indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, including new store growth, relocations, remodels, and refreshes, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pay future dividends;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may limit our ability to implement our business strategy;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the food retail industry or in the general economy and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the food retail industry; or\n\u2022\nprevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our store base and product offerings.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make payments on our indebtedness or to fund our operations.\nA failure of our internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business or stock price.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAny failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2016. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures - Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\u201d\nPrior to our initial public offering, we were treated as an S-corporation under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an S-corporation could harm us.\nPrior to November 2010, we were treated as an S-corporation. If the unaudited, open tax years in which we were an S-corporation are audited by the Internal Revenue Service, and we are determined not to have qualified for, or to have violated, our S-corporation status, we will be obligated to pay back taxes, interest and penalties, and we do not have the right to reclaim tax distributions we have made to our stockholders during those periods. These amounts could include taxes on all of our taxable income while we were an S-corporation. Any such claims could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into a tax indemnification agreement with certain stockholders and could become obligated to make payments to them for any additional federal, state or local income taxes assessed against them for fiscal periods prior to the initial public offering.\nPrior to November 2010, we were treated as an S-corporation. In the event of an adjustment to our reported taxable income for a period or periods prior to termination of our S-corporation status, our stockholders at that time could be liable for additional income taxes for those prior periods. Pursuant to a tax indemnification agreement into which we entered with certain stockholders, we agreed that upon filing any tax return (amended or otherwise), or in the event of any restatement of our taxable income, in each case for any period during which we were an S-corporation, we will make a payment to each stockholder on a pro rata basis in an amount sufficient so that the stockholder with the highest incremental estimated tax liability (calculated as if the stockholder would be taxable on its allocable share of our taxable income at the highest applicable federal, state and local tax rates and taking into account all amounts we previously distributed in respect of taxes for the relevant period) receives a payment equal to its incremental tax liability. Depending on the respective tax rates of such stockholders, the aggregate amount that we would be required to pay to the stockholders may be greater than the total amount of additional income taxes assessed. We also agreed to indemnify the stockholders for any interest, penalties, losses, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) arising out of any claim under the agreement.", "PERMNO": 12410, "SIC": 5411, "TIC": "TFM"}
