Risk Factors\nRisk Factor Summary\nIn the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in our industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The risk factors summarized below could materially harm our business, operating results and/or financial condition, impair our future prospects and/or cause the price of our common stock to decline. These risks are discussed more fully in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n\u2022We may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\u2022Certain executive officers and members of our Board of Directors have or will have interests and positions that could present potential conflicts.\n\u2022The Management Service Agreement was negotiated between related parties and the terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if it were negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.\n\u2022Our executive officers, directors and Manager may allocate some of their time to other businesses, thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022Conflicts of interest could arise in connection with certain of our directors\u2019 and executive officers\u2019 discharge of fiduciary duties to our shareholders.\n\u2022Our Manager and members of our management team may engage in activities that compete with us or our businesses.\n\u2022We cannot remove our Manager solely for poor performance, which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our shares.\n\u2022Our Manager can resign on 180 days\u2019 notice, subject to a limited extension, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as the market price of our shares.\n\u2022We must pay our Manager the management fee regardless of our performance.\n\u2022We cannot determine the amount of the management fee that will be paid over time with any certainty, nor are we able to determine with any certainty the amount of carried interest that will be paid over time, and our payment of such fees and carried interest to the Manager may significantly reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\n\u2022Our profit allocation may induce our Manager to make suboptimal decisions regarding our operations.\n\u2022The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the business of our Restaurant Group, which has and could continue to materially affect our Restaurant Group's operations, financial condition and results of operations for an extended period of time.\n\u2022General macroeconomic factors, including unemployment, energy prices and interest rates, and certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant and bakery industries that are largely out of our restaurant businesses' control may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022The Restaurant Group companies face significant competition for customers, real estate and employees and competitive pressure to adapt to changes in conditions driving customer demand. The Restaurant Group companies' inability to compete effectively may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022If our restaurant businesses are unable to effectively grow revenue and profitability, our Restaurant Group companies may be required to record additional impairment charges to restaurant assets, the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Increased commodity, energy and other costs could decrease our Restaurant Group companies' profit margins or cause the Restaurant Group companies to limit or otherwise modify their menus, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Negative customer experiences or negative publicity surrounding our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or other restaurants could adversely affect sales in one or more of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants and\nmake our concepts less valuable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our restaurant businesses could suffer due to reduced demand for our restaurant businesses' brands or specific menu offerings if our restaurant businesses are the subject of negative publicity or litigation regarding allegations of food-related contaminations or illnesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our investment in D&B may expose us to certain risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n\u2022We share certain directors with D&B or its affiliated entities, which may lead to conflicting interests.\n\u2022D&B's ability to implement and execute its strategic plans to transform the business may not be successful and, accordingly, D&B may not be successful in achieving its goals to transform its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Data security and integrity are critically important to D&B's business, and cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks, breaches of security, unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information, business disruption, or the perception that confidential information is not secure, could result in a material loss of business, regulatory enforcement, substantial legal liability and/or significant harm to its reputation.\n\u2022D&B's substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and its ability to operate its business or react to changes in the economy or its industry, prevent them from fulfilling its obligations and could divert its cash flow from operations for debt payments.\n\u2022An outbreak of disease, global or localized health pandemic or epidemic or a similar public health threat, or the fear of such an event, could have a material adverse effect on Dun & Bradstreet's business, financial condition and results operations.\n\u2022If Optimal Blue is unable to protect its information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches; are unable to provide adequate security in the electronic transmission of sensitive data; or are unable to prevent system failures or service interruptions, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, our investment.\n\u2022The outbreak of COVID-19 and resulting government response have negatively affected the global economy, the United States economy and the global financial markets, and may disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our Corporate and Other businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We share certain directors and officers with FNF, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report and other filings we have made and make in the future with the SEC, you should carefully consider the following risk factors and uncertainties, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Structure\nWe may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe do not believe that we are subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"40 Act\"). We engage primarily in the business of managing and operating our controlled subsidiaries that make up a majority of our portfolio of companies. Our officers, Manager and any employees who provide services to us pursuant to the terms of our corporate services agreement with FNF devote their activities to the businesses of these portfolio companies. Our interest in controlled portfolio companies comprises a substantial majority of our assets. Based on these factors, we believe that we are not an investment company under the 40 Act, including under Section 3(b)(1) of the 40 Act. If, at any time, we become primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, we could become subject to regulation under the 40 Act. Following any such change in our business and after giving effect to any applicable grace periods, we may be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to our corporate governance structure and financial reporting, and could restrict our activities going forward. In addition, if we were to become inadvertently subject to the 40 Act, any violation of the 40 Act could subject us to material adverse consequences, including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that certain of our contracts would be deemed unenforceable.\nCertain executive officers and members of our Board of Directors have or will have interests and positions that could present potential conflicts.\nCertain executive officers and members of our Board serve on the boards of directors of other entities or are employed by other entities, including D&B, Trasimene, FNF or Black Knight.\nAs a result of the foregoing, there may be circumstances where certain executive officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to, among other things: (i) our ongoing relationships with D&B, Trasimene or FNF; (ii) business opportunities arising for any of us, D&B, Trasimene, FNF or Black Knight; and (iii) conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us.\nWe have in place a code of business conduct and ethics prescribing procedures for managing conflicts of interest and our chief compliance officer and audit committee are responsible for the review, approval or ratification of any potential conflicts of interest transactions. Additionally, we expect that interested directors will abstain from decisions with respect to conflicts of interest as a matter of practice. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective, that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party.\nRefer to Note R to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our related party relationships and transactions with FNF and our Manager.\nRisks Relating to the Externalization and Our Manager\nThe Management Service Agreement was negotiated between related parties and the terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if it were negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.\nBecause our Manager is owned by certain of our directors and executive officers, the Management Services Agreement was developed by related parties, although our independent directors reviewed and approved the Management Services Agreement. The terms of the Management Services Agreement, including fees payable, may not reflect the terms we may have received if it was negotiated with an unrelated third party. In addition, particularly as a result of our relationship with the principal owners of the Manager, who are certain directors and members of our management team, our independent directors may determine that it is in the best interests of our shareholders not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under the Management Services Agreement because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with our Manager.\nOur executive officers, directors and Manager may allocate some of their time to other businesses, thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile the members of our management team anticipate devoting a substantial amount of their time to the affairs of the Company, our executive officers, directors, Manager and other members of our management team may engage in other business activities. This may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our management and the operations of other businesses. Their other business endeavors may involve related or unrelated parties. Conflicts of interest that arise over the allocation of time may not always be resolved in our favor and may materially adversely affect our results of operations. See the section entitled \u201cFactors Relating to the Split-Off\u201d included in Item 1A of our Annual Report for further discussion of risks associated with our split-off from, and relationship with, FNF.\nConflicts of interest could arise in connection with certain of our directors\u2019 and executive officers\u2019 discharge of fiduciary duties to our shareholders.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers are members of the Manager. Such persons, by virtue of their positions with us, have fiduciary duties to us and our shareholders. The duties of such persons as directors or executive officers to us and our shareholders may conflict with the interests of such persons in their capacities as members or employees of the Manager.\nOur Manager and members of our management team may engage in activities that compete with us or our businesses.\nWhile the members of our management team intend to devote a substantial majority of their time to the affairs of the Company, and while our Manager currently does not manage any other businesses that are in lines of business similar to our businesses, neither our management team nor our Manager is expressly prohibited from investing in or managing other entities, including those that are in the same or similar line of business as our businesses, or required to present any particular investment or business opportunity to the Company. In this regard, the Management Services Agreement and the obligation thereunder to provide management services to us will not create a mutually exclusive relationship between our Manager, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other.\nWe cannot remove our Manager solely for poor performance, which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nUnder the terms of the Management Services Agreement, our Manager may not be removed as a result of underperformance. Instead, the Company may only remove our Manager in certain limited circumstances or upon a vote by a majority of the Company\u2019s board of directors to terminate the Management Services Agreement. This limitation could adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nOur Manager can resign on 180 days\u2019 notice, subject to a limited extension, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as the market price of our shares.\nOur Manager has the right, under the Management Services Agreement, to resign at any time on 180 days\u2019 written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not, subject to the Company\u2019s right to extend such period by an additional 180 days or until a replacement manager has been in place for 30 days, if no replacement manager has been found by the 150th day following the Manager\u2019s notice of resignation. If our Manager resigns, we may not be able to contract with a new manager or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 180 days (subject to possible extension), or at all, in which case our operations are likely to experience a disruption; our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected; and the market price of our shares may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management, acquisition activities and supervision of our businesses is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our Manager. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our businesses may result in additional costs and time delays that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nWe must pay our Manager the management fee regardless of our performance.\nOur Manager is entitled to receive a management fee that is based on our cost of invested capital, as defined in the Management Services Agreement, regardless of the performance of our businesses. The calculation of the management fee is unrelated to the Company\u2019s results of operations. As a result, the management fee may incentivize our Manager to increase the amount of invested capital.\nWe cannot determine the amount of the management fee that will be paid over time with any certainty, nor are we able to determine with any certainty the amount of carried interest that will be paid over time, and our payment of such fees and carried interest to the Manager may significantly reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nUnder the Management Services Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay a management fee to and, subject to certain exceptions, reimburse the costs and out-of-pocket expenses of our Manager incurred on behalf of the Company in connection with the provision of services to the Company. The management fee is calculated by reference to the Company\u2019s cost of invested capital, which will be impacted by the acquisition or disposition of, and additional capital contributions and investments in, businesses, which can be significantly influenced by our Manager, as well as the performance of our businesses and other businesses we may acquire in the future. Changes in cost of invested capital and in the resulting management fee could be significant, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, if the performance of the Company declines, assuming cost of invested capital remains the same, management fees will increase as a percentage of the Company\u2019s net income.\nFurthermore, we cannot determine the amount of carried interest with respect to liquidity events involving investments of the Company that will be paid over time with any certainty. Such determination would be dependent on the potential sale proceeds received for any of our businesses and the performance of the Company and its businesses over a multi-year period of time, among other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. Such factors may have a significant impact on the amount of any carried interest to be paid to the Manager. Likewise, such determination would be dependent on whether certain hurdles were surpassed giving rise to a payment of carried interest. Any amounts paid in respect of the carried interest are unrelated to the management fee earned for performance of services under the Management Services Agreement.\nWhile it is difficult to quantify with any certainty the actual amount of any such payments in the future, such amounts could be substantial. The management fee and carried interest will be payment obligations of the Company and, as a result, will be paid, along with other Company obligations, prior to the payment of distributions to shareholders. As a result the payment of these amounts may significantly reduce the amount of cash flow available for distribution to our shareholders. If we do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the management fee and carried interest when such payments are due, we may be required to liquidate assets or incur debt in order to make such payments. This circumstance could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nOur profit allocation may induce our Manager to make suboptimal decisions regarding our operations.\nOur Manager will receive carried interest based on profits in excess of an annualized hurdle rate upon a liquidity event involving a Company investment. In this respect, a calculation and payment of carried interest may be triggered upon the sale of\none of our businesses. As a result, our Manager may be incentivized to recommend the sale of one or more of our businesses to our Board of Directors at a time that may not be optimal for our shareholders.\nRisks Relating to the Restaurant Group\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the business of our Restaurant Group, which has and could continue to materially affect our Restaurant Group's operations, financial condition and results of operations for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak, the federal, state and local government responses to COVID-19 and our responses to the outbreak have all disrupted and will continue to disrupt our Restaurant Group businesses. In the United States, individuals are being encouraged to practice social distancing, in most places are restricted from gathering in groups and in many cases, placed on complete restriction from non-essential movements outside of their homes. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak and these changing conditions, we closed the dining rooms in substantially all of our restaurants in late March 2020 with substantially all remaining closed through early May 2020. Beginning in March 2020 and lasting into May 2020, in most of our restaurants we were solely operating to-go and delivery services in the jurisdictions where government regulations permit restaurants to continue to operate and where the guest demand makes such operations sustainable. We temporarily closed certain restaurants, modified work hours for our Restaurant Group employees and identified and implemented cost savings measures throughout our Restaurant Group operations. If the COVID-19 outbreak deteriorates again, we may again be required to close the dining rooms in substantially all of our restaurants and solely operate to-go and delivery services, which would further adversely affect the results of operations of our Restaurant Group.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and these responses have affected and will continue to adversely affect our Restaurant Group brands' guest traffic, sales and operating costs and we cannot predict how long the outbreak will last or what other government responses may occur.\nSuppliers of our Restaurant Group could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. If our Restaurant Group's suppliers\u2019 access to resources is constrained or their employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our Restaurant Group businesses could face shortages of food items or other restaurant supplies and our Restaurant Group's operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the financial results of our Restaurant Group and depending on the duration and scope, such impact could continue to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nSee further discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our Restaurant Group's results in the Results of Operations subsection in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report.\nGeneral macroeconomic factors, including unemployment, energy prices and interest rates, and certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant and bakery industries that are largely out of our restaurant businesses' control may materially and adversely affect consumer behavior and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may materially and adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our restaurant businesses, which we also refer to as our Restaurant Group companies. Recessionary economic cycles, a protracted economic slowdown, a worsening economy, increased unemployment, increased energy prices, rising interest rates, a downgrade of the United States (\"U.S.\") government's long-term credit rating, financial market volatility and unpredictability or other national, regional and local regulatory and economic conditions or other industry-wide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and result in increased pressure with respect to our Restaurant Group companies' pricing, guest count levels and commodity costs, which could lead to a further decline in our Restaurant Group companies' sales and earnings, beyond those that resulted in the Blue Ribbon Reorganization. Job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause customers to make fewer discretionary purchases, and any significant decrease in our Restaurant Group companies' guest counts or profit will negatively impact their financial performance. In addition, if gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs increase, or credit card, home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our Restaurant Group companies' customers may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine at restaurants, may spend less during each visit at our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or may choose more inexpensive restaurants. These factors could also cause the Restaurant Group companies to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings, close additional restaurants, delay the reimaging of the Restaurant Group companies' existing restaurant locations, or impede our ability to successfully execute, and achieve the goals contemplated by, the Blue Ribbon Reorganization.\nThe business results of our Restaurant Group companies depend on a number of industry-specific factors as well, many of which are beyond the Restaurant Group companies' control. The full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer confidence, consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences,\nincluding changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits, and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands. The performance of individual restaurants may also be materially and adversely affected by factors applicable to those restaurants, such as demographic trends, severe weather, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.\nThe quarterly results of our Restaurant Group companies have been and may continue to be affected by restaurant closures and exit-related costs, labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel, changes in borrowings and interest rates, changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions, fluctuations in food and commodity prices, fluctuations in costs attributable to public company compliance and impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and property, fixtures and equipment. As a result of these and other factors, the Restaurant Group companies' financial results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nUnfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our Restaurant Group companies' customers or industry could increase costs, reduce guest counts in some or all restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Restaurant Group companies face significant competition for customers, real estate and employees and competitive pressure to adapt to changes in conditions driving customer demand. The Restaurant Group companies' inability to compete effectively may affect guest counts, sales and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive with a substantial number of restaurant operators that compete directly and indirectly with the Restaurant Group companies with respect to price, service, ambiance, brand, customer service, dining experience, location, food quality and variety and value perception of menu items and there are other well established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than the Restaurant Group companies. Some of our Restaurant Group companies' competitors advertise on national television, which may provide customers with greater awareness and name recognition than our Restaurant Group companies can achieve through their advertising efforts. There is also active competition for management personnel and attractive suitable real estate sites. Consumer tastes and perceptions, nutritional and dietary trends, guest count patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants often affect the restaurant business, and our Restaurant Group companies' competitors may react more efficiently and effectively to those conditions. For instance, prevailing health or dietary preferences or perceptions of our Restaurant Group companies' products may cause consumers to avoid certain menu items or products our Restaurant Group companies offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy, and such choices by consumers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our Restaurant Group companies face growing competition from the supermarket industry, with the improvement of their \"convenient meals\" in the deli and prepared food sections, from quick service and fast casual restaurants and online food delivery services as a result of food and beverage offerings by those food providers. As our Restaurant Group companies' competitors expand operations in markets where our restaurant businesses operate or expect to operate, we expect competition to intensify. If our Restaurant Group companies are unable to continue to compete effectively, including following the completion of the Blue Ribbon Reorganization, their guest counts, sales and profit margins could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our restaurant businesses are unable to effectively grow revenue and profitability, our Restaurant Group companies may be required to record additional impairment charges to restaurant assets, the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Restaurant Group companies assess the potential impairment of their long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is being used, an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our Restaurant Group companies annually review and compare the carrying value of intangible assets, including goodwill, to the fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $7.8 million, $10.4 million and $26.7 million, respectively, of impairment to goodwill in our Restaurant Group segment as a result of deteriorating operating results and cash flow resulting from declining same store sales and increased costs. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recorded $11.8 million, $17.1 million, and $5.8 million, respectively, of impairment expense related to other intangible assets within our Restaurant Group.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any future recorded impairment to our Restaurant Group companies' assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible or long-lived assets become further impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased commodity, energy and other costs could decrease our Restaurant Group companies' profit margins or cause the Restaurant Group companies to limit or otherwise modify their menus, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost, availability and quality of ingredients restaurant operations use to prepare their food is subject to a range of factors, many of which are beyond their control. A significant component of our restaurant businesses' costs will be related to food commodities, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, poultry, dairy products, oils, produce, fruit, flour and other related costs such as energy and transportation over which we may have little control, that can be subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, changes in international commodity markets and other factors. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these commodities, our Restaurant Group companies' results of operations may be negatively affected. In addition, the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants are dependent upon frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet certain specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality, and cost of ingredients, which would likely lower revenues, damage the Restaurant Group companies' reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nNegative customer experiences or negative publicity surrounding our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or other restaurants could adversely affect sales in one or more of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants and make our concepts less valuable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we believe our Restaurant Group companies' success depends significantly on their ability to provide exceptional food quality, outstanding service and an excellent overall dining experience, adverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to food quality, public health concerns, illness, safety, injury or government or industry findings concerning our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants, restaurants operated by other food service providers or others across the food industry supply chain could affect our Restaurant Group companies more than it would other restaurants that compete primarily on price or other factors. If customers perceive or experience a reduction in the food quality, service or ambiance at our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or in any way believe our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants have failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, the value and popularity of one or more of our Restaurant Group companies' concepts could suffer. Further, because our restaurant businesses rely heavily on \"word-of-mouth,\" as opposed to more conventional mediums of advertisement, to establish concept recognition, our restaurant businesses may be more adversely affected by negative customer experiences than other dining establishments, including those of our restaurant businesses' competitors.\nOur restaurant businesses could suffer due to reduced demand for our restaurant businesses' brands or specific menu offerings if our restaurant businesses are the subject of negative publicity or litigation regarding allegations of food-related contaminations or illnesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFood safety is a top priority, and our Restaurant Group companies dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that their customers enjoy safe, quality food products. Food-related contaminations and illnesses may be caused by a variety of food-borne pathogens, such as E. coli or salmonella, which are frequently carried on unwashed fruits and vegetables, from a variety of illnesses transmitted by restaurant workers, such as hepatitis A, which may not be diagnosed prior to being infectious, and from contamination of food by foreign substances. Contamination and food borne illness incidents could also be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers and distributors. As a result, we cannot control all of the potential sources of contamination or illness that can be contained in or transmitted from our Restaurant Group companies' food. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our Restaurant Group companies' brands and have a negative impact on their sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our Restaurant Group companies' competitors or at one of our Restaurant Group companies' suppliers could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our Restaurant Group companies' sales.\nIf any person becomes injured or ill, or alleges becoming injured or ill, as a result of eating our Restaurant Group companies' food, our Restaurant Group companies may temporarily close some restaurants or their bakery facilities, which would decrease their revenues, and our restaurant businesses may be liable for damages or be subject to governmental regulatory action, either of which could have long-lasting, negative effects on our restaurant businesses' reputation, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether our restaurant businesses are found liable. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.\nOur Restaurant Group companies' failure to comply with government regulation, and the costs of compliance or non-compliance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Restaurant Group companies are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting their business. Each of their restaurants and their bakery division are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of federal, state and local governmental authorities, which may include, among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety, nutritional menu labeling, health care, environmental and fire agencies. Difficulty in obtaining or failure to obtain the required licenses, including liquor or other licenses, permits or approval could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area. Additionally, difficulties or inabilities to retain or renew licenses, or increased compliance costs due to changed regulations, could adversely affect operations at existing restaurants.\nThere is also a potential for increased regulation of certain food establishments in the U.S., where compliance with Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (\"HACCP\") management systems may now be required. HACCP refers to a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of potential hazards from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Many states have required restaurants to develop and implement HACCP programs and the U.S. government continues to expand the sectors of the food industry that must adopt and implement HACCP programs. For example, the Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law in January 2011, granted the FDA new authority regarding the safety of the entire food system, including through increased inspections and mandatory food recalls. We anticipate that the new requirements may impact the restaurant industry. Additionally, our Restaurant Group companies' suppliers may initiate or otherwise be subject to food recalls that may impact the availability of certain products, result in adverse publicity or require the Restaurant Group companies' to take actions that could be costly for them or otherwise harm their business.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our Restaurant Group companies' cost structure or lessen their operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase the Restaurant Group companies' exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nRestaurant companies, including our restaurant companies, are the target of claims and lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Proceedings of this nature, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial costs and damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Restaurant Group companies and other restaurant companies have been subject to claims and lawsuits alleging various matters from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including those that follow. Claims and lawsuits may include class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, the sharing of tips amongst certain employees, overtime eligibility of assistant managers and failure to pay for all hours worked. Although our restaurant businesses will maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these matters. Accordingly, if our restaurant businesses are required to pay substantial damages and expenses as a result of these types or other lawsuits, such payments or expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOccasionally, our Restaurant Group companies' customers may file complaints or lawsuits against the Restaurant Group companies alleging that they are responsible for some illness or injury the customers suffered at or after a visit to one of the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illness and relating to notices with respect to chemicals contained in food products required under state law. Our Restaurant Group companies may also be subject to a variety of other claims from third parties arising in the ordinary course of their business, including personal injury claims, contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state laws. In addition, most of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants are subject to state \"dram shop\" or similar laws that generally allow a person to sue our restaurant businesses if that person was injured by a legally intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages at one of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers. In addition, the Restaurant Group companies may also be subject to lawsuits from their employees or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits in the restaurant industry have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants.\nRegardless of whether any claims against the Restaurant Group companies are valid or whether they are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from their operations. In addition, such claims may generate negative publicity, which could reduce customer traffic and sales. Although our restaurant businesses will maintain what they believe to\nbe adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. Defense costs, even for unfounded claims, or a judgment or other liability in excess of our restaurant businesses' insurance coverage for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Restaurant Group companies rely heavily on information technology and any material failure, interruption, or security breach in their systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Restaurant Group companies rely heavily on information technology systems across their operations and corporate functions, including for order and delivery from suppliers and distributors, point-of-sale processing in their restaurants, management of their supply chains, payment of obligations, collection of cash, bakery production, data warehousing to support analytics, finance or accounting systems, labor optimization tools, gift cards, online business and various other processes and transactions, including the storage of employee and customer information. The Restaurant Group companies' ability to effectively manage their business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of their products will depend significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our restaurant businesses' operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. In addition, customers and employees have a high expectation that our restaurant businesses will adequately protect their personal information. The majority of our restaurant businesses' restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. We and other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their customers has been stolen.\nIn addition, any breach in customer payment information could result in investigations by the U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force (\"ECTF\") and increased cost in our restaurant businesses' efforts to cooperate with the ECTF.\nThe Restaurant Group companies also maintain certain personal information regarding their employees. In addition to government investigations, the Restaurant Group companies may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of their customers' credit or debit card information or if customer or employee information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately. If the Restaurant Group companies fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a significant breach of customer, employee or company data, their reputation could be damaged and they could experience lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Additionally, if a person is able to circumvent the security measures intended to protect our Restaurant Group companies' employee or customer private data, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information and disrupt our restaurant businesses' operations. The Restaurant Group companies may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance their systems in order to prevent or remediate any such attacks.\nThe success of the Restaurant Group depends, in part, on its intellectual property, which we may be unable to protect.\nWe regard our Restaurant Group's service marks, including \"O'Charley's\", \"Ninety Nine\", \"Village Inn\", \"Legendary Baking\", and \"Bakers Square\", and other service marks and trademarks as important factors in the marketing of our restaurants. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our brand's menu items and for various advertising slogans. We are aware of names and marks similar to our Restaurant Group's service marks and trademarks used by other persons in certain geographic areas where we have restaurants. We believe such uses will not adversely affect us and our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks.\nWe license the use of our registered trademarks and service marks to franchisees and third parties through franchise arrangements and licenses. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees' and licensees' activities with respect to the use of our trademarks and service marks, and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks and service marks.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Investment in Dun & Bradstreet\nOur investment in D&B may expose us to certain risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nD&B\u2019s transformation strategy is based on several strategic initiatives and growth strategies. The achievement of its strategic initiatives and growth strategies depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to its ability to maintain the integrity of its brand and reputation, client demand for its solutions, the effect of macro-economic challenges on its clients and vendors, its reliance on third parties to provide data and certain operational services and its ability to protect its information technology. D&B may not be able to successfully implement its strategic initiatives in accordance with its expectations, or in\nthe timeframe it desires, which may result in us not realizing our expected return on our investment in D&B, or result in a negative return on investment.\nWe record our investment in D&B using the equity method of accounting, through which we record our proportionate share of their net earnings or loss in our consolidated financial statements. Equity-method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If our equity-method investment is not recoverable, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe share certain directors with D&B or its affiliated entities, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nOne of our directors, Bill Foley, and our CEO and director, Richard N. Massey, also serve on the board of directors of D&B. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with D&B and/or its respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, D&B or any of our or its respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping director.\nD&B's ability to implement and execute its strategic plans to transform the business may not be successful and, accordingly, D&B may not be successful in achieving its goals to transform its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nD&B may not be successful in developing and implementing its strategic plans to transform its businesses, including realigning management, simplifying and scaling technology, expanding and enhancing data and optimizing its client services. If the development or implementation of D&B's plans are not successful, they may not produce the revenue, margins, earnings or synergies that we expect, including offsetting the impact of adverse economic conditions that may exist currently or develop in the future. D&B may also face delays or difficulties in implementing technological, organizational and operational improvements, including its plans to leverage our data insights in new functional areas and utilize existing data architecture to generate high contribution incremental revenue streams, which could adversely affect its ability to successfully compete. In addition, the costs associated with implementing such plans may be more than anticipated and D&B may not have sufficient financial resources to fund all of the desired or necessary investments required in connection with its plans. The existing and future execution of D&B's strategic and operating plans to transform its business will, to some extent, also be dependent on external factors that they cannot control. In addition, these strategic and operational plans need to be continually reassessed to meet the challenges and needs of its business in order for D&B to remain competitive. The failure to implement and execute its strategic and operating plans in a timely manner or at all, realize or maintain the cost savings or other benefits or improvements associated with such plans, have financial resources to fund the costs associated with such plans or incur costs in excess of anticipated amounts, or sufficiently assess and reassess these plans could have a material adverse effect on D&B's business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our investment in D&B.\nD&B's brand and reputation are key assets and a competitive advantage, and its business may be affected by how it is perceived in the marketplace.\nD&B's brand and reputation are key assets of its business and a competitive advantage. D&B's ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of its level of data quality, effective provision of solutions, business practices, including the actions of its employees, third-party providers, members of D&B's world-wide network of partners and other brand licensees, some of which may not be consistent with its policies and standards. Negative perception or publicity regarding these matters could damage D&B's reputation with clients and the public, which could make it difficult for it to attract and maintain clients. Adverse developments with respect to its industry may also, by association, negatively impact its reputation, or result in higher regulatory or legislative scrutiny. Negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on D&B's business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our investment in D&B.\nData security and integrity are critically important to D&B's business, and cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks, breaches of security, unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information, business disruption, or the perception that confidential information is not secure, could result in a material loss of business, regulatory enforcement, substantial legal liability and/or significant harm to its reputation.\nD&B collects, stores and transmits a large amount of confidential company information on over 420 million total businesses as of December 31, 2020, including financial information and personal information. D&B operates in an environment of significant risk of cybersecurity incidents resulting from unintentional events or deliberate attacks by third parties or insiders, which may involve exploiting highly obscure security vulnerabilities or sophisticated attack methods. These cyberattacks can take many forms, but they typically have one or more of the following objectives, among others: (1) obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, (2) manipulate or destroy data or (3) disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on D&B's systems.\nD&B has experienced and expects to continue to experience numerous attempts to access its computer systems, software, networks, data and other technology assets on a daily basis. The security and protection of its data is a top priority for D&B.\nD&B devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade the wide array of physical, technical and contractual safeguards that it employs to provide security around the collection, storage, use, access and delivery of information D&B has in its possession. Despite D&B's physical security, implementation of technical controls and contractual precautions to identify, detect and prevent the unauthorized access to and alteration and disclosure of its data, D&B cannot be certain that third party systems that have access to its systems will not be compromised or disrupted in the future, whether as a result of criminal conduct or other advanced, employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Due to the sensitive nature of the information D&B collects, stores and transmits, it is not unusual for efforts to occur (coordinated or otherwise) by unauthorized persons to attempt to obtain access to its systems or data, or to inhibit D&B's ability to deliver products or services to a consumer or a business customer.\nD&B must continually monitor and develop its information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. The preventive actions D&B takes to address cybersecurity risk, including protection of its systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of cyberattacks as it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to its systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all cybersecurity risks. This is because, among other things: (1) the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may not be recognized until after the attacks have succeeded; (2) cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including sophisticated threat actors involved in organized crime, sponsored by nation-states, or linked to terrorist or hacktivist organizations; and (3) third parties may seek to gain access to D&B's systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, clients, third-party service providers or other users.\nAlthough D&B has not incurred material losses or liabilities to date as a result of any breaches, unauthorized disclosure, loss or corruption of its data or inability of its clients to access its systems, such events could disrupt D&B's operations, subject it to substantial regulatory and legal proceedings and potential liability and fines, result in a material loss of business and/or significantly harm its reputation.\nD&B may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a cybersecurity incident because a successful breach of its computer systems, software, networks or other technology assets could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to, among other things: (1) the breadth and complexity of its operations and the high volume of transactions that is processes; (2) the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which D&B does business with; (3) the proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks; and (4) the possibility that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.\nThe extent of a particular cybersecurity incident and the steps that D&B may need to take to investigate it may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, D&B may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident.\nDue to concerns about data security and integrity, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted breach notification and other requirements in the event that information subject to such laws is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy and security of such data are possible. In the United States, D&B is subject to laws that provide for at least 50 disparate notification regimes. Complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of unauthorized access would be expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could subject D&B to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability.\nIf D&B is unable to protect its computer systems, software, networks, data and other technology assets it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our investment in D&B.\nD&B's substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and its ability to operate its business or react to changes in the economy or its industry, prevent them from fulfilling its obligations and could divert its cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nD&B has a substantial amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest and principal payments. As of December 31, 2020, D&B has $3,255.8 million in total long-term debt outstanding. In addition, subject to the limitations contained in the credit agreements governing certain of D&B's credit facilities, D&B may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. If D&B does so, the risks related to its high level of debt could increase. This substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences to D&B, including the following: (1) it may be difficult for D&B to satisfy its obligations, including debt service requirements under its outstanding indebtedness; (2) D&B's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes may be impaired; (3) requiring a\nsubstantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing D&B's ability to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes; (4) D&B will be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and its flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in its business or industry will be more limited; (5) D&B's ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to its competitors, may be compromised due to its high level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in its credit agreements and indentures; (6) D&B's ability to borrow additional funds or to refinance indebtedness may be limited; and (7) it may cause potential or existing clients or vendors to not contract with D&B due to concerns over its ability to meet its financial obligations.\nAn outbreak of disease, global or localized health pandemic or epidemic or a similar public health threat, or the fear of such an event, could have a material adverse effect on Dun & Bradstreet's business, financial condition and results operations.\nA significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population, such as COVID-19, could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could have an adverse effect on demand for Dun & Bradstreet's solutions and access to its data sources. Disruptions in the financial markets could limit the ability or willingness of D&B's clients to extend credit to their customers or cause its clients to constrain budgets, which could adversely impact demand for D&B's data and analytics solutions. The U.S. and other governments abroad have implemented enhanced screening, broad shelter-in-place orders and social distancing requirements, business closures, quarantine requirements and travel restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 global pandemic. In addition to governmental measures, companies, including Dun & Bradstreet, are imposing, or may impose, temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to employees, customers and communities, including requiring that employees work remotely and restricting non-essential travel. Additionally, many businesses permanently reduced employee headcount and many others have permanently ceased operations as a result of the pandemic. Given the breadth of Dun & Bradstreet's data, the large number of countries the data is sourced from and system requirements necessary to process and analyze such data, many of D&B's employees and employees of its partners may be limited or unable to effectively work remotely. Further, D&B's employees travel frequently to maintain relationships with and sell solutions to its clients. Continued mandates that employees work remotely, prolonged travel restrictions or general economic uncertainty could negatively impact D&B's suppliers\u2019 ability to provide it with data and services, D&B's ability to deliver or market its solutions and client demand for D&B's solutions. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on D&B's operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the global pandemic, related travel advisories, business closures and quarantine or social distancing restrictions, the speed of recovery once the pandemic subsides, the impact of any resurgence of the pandemic once measures to slow the spread of the virus have been lifted and impacts to the global markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Preventing the effects from and responding to this market disruption or any other public health threat, related or otherwise, could further impact demand for D&B's solutions and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nD&B has elected to take advantage of the \u2018\u2018controlled company\u2019\u2019 exemption to the corporate governance rules for publicly listed companies, which could make their common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm their stock price.\nBecause D&B qualifies as a \u2018\u2018controlled company\u2019\u2019 under the corporate governance rules for publicly listed companies, D&B is not required to have a majority of its Board of Directors be independent under the applicable rules of the NYSE, nor is it required to have a compensation committee or a corporate governance and nominating committee comprised entirely of independent directors, and its audit committee is not required to be comprised entirely of independent directors for a period of one year following its initial public offering. Accordingly, should the interests of the Investor Consortium differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. D&B's status as a controlled company could make its common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm its stock price and, thus, the value of our investment.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Investment in Optimal Blue\nIf Optimal Blue is unable to protect its information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches; are unable to provide adequate security in the electronic transmission of sensitive data; or are unable to prevent system failures or service interruptions, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, our investment.\nOptimal Blue is highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Optimal Blue depends heavily upon its computer systems and cloud computing and system interruptions or events beyond its control could interrupt or terminate the delivery of its solutions and services to its clients and may interfere with its suppliers' ability to provide necessary data to it and its employees' ability to perform their responsibilities.\nSecurity breaches of Optimal Blue\u2019s infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, and the evolving threat landscape can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized\ndisclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, consumer data and proprietary business information. Cyber-based attacks, including those to extort payment in return for the release of sensitive information, are increasing. Unauthorized access, including through use of fraudulent schemes such as \"phishing\" schemes, could jeopardize the security of information stored in Optimal Blue\u2019s systems. In addition, malware or viruses could jeopardize the security of information stored or used in a user's computer. If Optimal Blue is unable to prevent or detect such security or privacy breaches, its operations could be disrupted, or it may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss, lawsuits and regulatory-imposed restrictions and penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive consumer data, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately the value of our investment.\nIf Optimal Blue fails to adapt its solutions to technological changes or evolving industry standards and regulations, or if its ongoing efforts to upgrade, modernize or innovate its technology are not successful, Optimal Blue may not be able to achieve its growth strategies and could lose clients and have difficulty attracting new clients for its solutions.\nThe markets for Optimal Blue\u2019s solutions are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards and regulations. Optimal Blue\u2019s growth strategies and future success will be significantly affected by its ability to successfully enhance its current solutions, and to develop and introduce new solutions and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its clients and their customers. These initiatives carry the risks associated with any new product or service development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance issues. There can be no assurance that Optimal Blue will be successful in developing, marketing and selling new solutions and services that meet these changing demands, that it will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these solutions and services or that Optimal Blue\u2019s new solutions and services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. If Optimal Blue\u2019s efforts are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, the value of our investment.\nOptimal Blue relies upon proprietary technology and information rights, and if it is unable to protect its rights, it could have a material adverse effect on it and ultimately our investment value. Similarly, if Optimal Blue\u2019s applications, solutions, including those that contain \"open source\" software, or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or fail to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses, Optimal Blue may be required to change its business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties.\nOptimal Blue\u2019s success depends, in part, upon its intellectual property rights. Optimal Blue relies primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying, distribution and creation of derivative products to protect its proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and its intellectual property could be used by others without Optimal Blue\u2019s consent. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of or failure to protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on Optimal Blue\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, the value of our investment. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect its intellectual property rights, to protect its trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, the value of our investment.\nAs Optimal Blue\u2019s information technology applications and services develop, it may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend, cause Optimal Blue to cease providing solutions that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require Optimal blue to redesign its solutions, if feasible, divert management's attention and resources; or require Optimal Blue to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Any one or more of the foregoing outcomes could have a material adverse effect on Optimal Blue\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, the value of our investment.\nOptimal Blue\u2019s reliance on third parties subjects it to risk and may disrupt or adversely affect its operations. In addition, it may not realize the full benefit of its third-party arrangements, which may result in increased costs, or may adversely affect the service levels Optimal Blue is able to provide its clients.\nOptimal Blue relies upon third parties for various business process and technology-related products and services, including cloud-based providers. Although Optimal Blue has contractual provisions with its providers that specify performance requirements, Optimal Blue does not ultimately control their performance, which may make its operations vulnerable to third-party performance failures. In addition, Optimal Blue\u2019s failure to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of its third-party vendors could subject it to additional risk. Reliance on third parties also makes Optimal blue vulnerable to changes in its vendors' businesses, financial condition and other matters outside of Optimal Blue\u2019s control, including their violations of laws or regulations, which could increase Optimal Blue\u2019s exposure to liability or otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of its business. If for any reason Optimal Blue\u2019s relationship with any of these third parties, including cloud-based\nproviders, were to end unexpectedly, it could require a significant amount of cost and time to transition to new third-party service providers. The failure of Optimal Blue\u2019s providers to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in significant disruptions and costs to Optimal Blue\u2019s operations and to the services it provides to its clients, or could result in loss of revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, the value of our investment.\nOptimal Blue and its clients are subject to various governmental regulations, including regulations over the mortgage loan industry or which address the mortgage loan market, and a failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes in these regulations, including changes that may result from changes in the political landscape or the use of consumer data and public records, could result in penalties, restrict or limit Optimal Blue or its clients' operations or make it more burdensome to conduct such operations.\nMany of Optimal Blue\u2019s clients' and its businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Optimal Blue\u2019s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could restrict its ability to provide certain services or result in imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties, substantial regulatory and compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity and loss of revenues. As a provider of electronic data processing to financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, Optimal Blue is subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Counsel.\nA portion of Optimal Blue\u2019s Compass Analytics, LLC (\"Compass Analytics\") business provides risk management, loan sales (best execution) and general secondary marketing advisory and hedge execution services in concert with licensing Compass Analytics\u2019 mortgage loan valuation and risk management analytics to its clients. Through this business, Compass Analytics may advise clients regarding their best practices, strategic relationships and workflow, but earns no commission or compensation for any trade execution or volume and does not have custody of any client funds or securities. Compass Analytics offers these advisory services to mortgage loan originators and servicers, including mortgage banks, community and commercial banks, credit unions, mortgage loan insurers, government agencies, investors, Federal Home Loan Banks and real estate investment trusts. As a result, Compass Analytics is registered with and regulated by the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (\"Investment Advisers Act\"). The failure by Compass Analytics to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions, any of which could have a negative impact on Compass Analytic\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, the value of our investment. Even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a fine or sanction or the fine or sanction imposed against Compass Analytics or its employees by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to an investigation, proceeding or imposition of these fines or sanctions could harm Compass Analytic\u2019s reputation and cause it to lose existing clients.\nIn addition, Optimal Blue\u2019s businesses are subject to an increased degree of compliance oversight by regulators and by its clients. Specifically, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \"CFPB\") has authority to write rules affecting the business of, supervise, conduct examinations of and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial laws and regulations with respect to certain \"non-depository covered persons\" determined by the CFPB to be \"larger participants\" that offer consumer financial products and services. The CFPB and the prudential financial institution regulators such as the OCC also have the authority to examine Optimal Blue in its role as a service provider to large financial institutions. In addition, we believe some of Optimal Blue\u2019s largest bank clients' regulators are requiring the banks to exercise greater oversight and perform more rigorous audits of their key service providers such as Optimal Blue.\nChanges to laws and regulations and regulatory oversight of Optimal Blue and its clients, including those that may result from changes in the political landscape, may cause Optimal Blue to increase its prices in certain situations or decrease its prices in other situations, may restrict its ability to implement price increases or otherwise limit the manner in which Optimal Blue conducts its business. Optimal Blue may also incur additional expense in keeping its software solutions services up to date as laws and regulations change, and it may not be able to pass those additional costs on to its clients. In addition, in response to increased regulatory oversight, participants in the mortgage lending industry may develop policies pursuant to which they limit the extent to which they can rely on any one vendor or service provider. Conversely, in an environment with less stringent regulatory oversight, prospective clients may choose to retain their in-house platforms, or current service providers, or seek alternative service providers who provide services that are less compliance and quality oriented at a lower price point. If Optimal Blue is unable to adapt its products and services to conform to increased or evolving laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations have a negative effect on its clients, Optimal Blue may experience client losses or increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, the value of our investment.\nBecause Optimal Blue\u2019s databases include certain public and non-public personal information concerning consumers, it is subject to government regulation and potential adverse publicity concerning our use of consumer data. Optimal Blue acquires, stores and uses many types of consumer data and related services that are subject to regulation under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and, to a lesser extent, various other federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed\nto protect the privacy of consumers and to prevent security breaches, cyber-based attacks, other unauthorized access and misuse of personal information in the marketplace. Optimal Blue\u2019s failure to comply with these laws, or any future laws or regulations of a similar nature, could result in substantial regulatory penalties, litigation expense or loss of revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, the value of our investment.\nThe mortgage loan industry is heavily regulated and continues to be subject to review by governmental authorities. Inquiries may include federal and state governmental review of all aspects of the mortgage lending business. Such efforts may include actions to address the housing market and the economy in general and to maintain rigorous mortgage loan servicing standards. Additional state and federal government actions directed at housing and the mortgage loan industry may occur and could have a material adverse effect on Optimal Blue\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, the value of our investment.\nBecause Optimal Blue\u2019s revenues from clients in the mortgage lending industry are affected by the strength of the economy and the housing market generally, including the volume of real estate transactions, a change in any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on it.\nOptimal Blue\u2019s revenues are primarily generated from software and hosting solutions and professional services it provides to the mortgage loan industry and, as a result, a weak economy or housing market may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately, the value of our investment. The volume of mortgage loan origination and residential real estate transactions is highly variable and reductions in these transaction volumes could have a direct effect on the revenues of Optimal Blue.\nRisks Relating to the Split-Off\nWe may incur material costs as a result of our separation from FNF, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our separation from FNF, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs and expenses not previously incurred. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting or costs associated with complying with the federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, tax administration and human resources related functions.) FNF provided many of these services for us at no-cost (other than reimbursement of FNF's out-of-pocket costs and expenses) under the CSA until November 2020. In October 2020, we entered into an Extension of Corporate Services Agreement (the \u201cExtension\u201d) with FNF. Pursuant to the Extension, the term of the CSA is extended for two years until November 17, 2022 (the \u201cExtended Term\u201d). During the Extended Term, FNF will provide certain corporate services to Cannae at FNF\u2019s Standard Allocation (as defined in the CSA), plus 10%, and Cannae agrees to pay or reimburse FNF for any fees, costs or other expenses paid by FNF to third parties in connection with the corporate services. The CSA will automatically renew for successive one-year terms, unless the parties mutually agree to terminate the CSA at least 30 days prior to the applicable termination date. No later than 30 days prior to such termination date, the parties shall negotiate mutually agreeable arm\u2019s length terms for each additional one-year term.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not incur third-party vendor costs or out-of-pocket expenses under the CSA that are material to our business. Moreover, we will have to develop internal departments/functions to perform the services at the end of the term of the CSA.\nWe share certain directors and officers with FNF, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nOne of our executive officers, Michael L. Gravelle, is also an executive officer of FNF and one of our directors, Bill Foley, also serves on the boards of directors of FNF or its subsidiaries. Our executive officers and members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at FNF or any other public company have fiduciary duties to that company's stockholders. We also are party to a variety of related party agreements and relationships with FNF and certain of FNF's subsidiaries and FNF and subsidiaries of FNF have an ownership interest in Cannae Holdings. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with FNF and/or its respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, FNF or any of our or its respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nOur agreements with FNF were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of FNF.\nWe have a number of agreements with FNF covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by FNF for certain of our businesses. In addition, we have entered into (i) the CSA, (ii) a voting agreement with FNF, pursuant to which FNF agrees to appear or cause all shares of Cannae Holdings common stock that FNF or its subsidiaries, as applicable, own after the Split-Off to be counted as present at any meeting of the stockholders of Cannae Holdings, for the purpose of establishing a quorum, and agrees to vote all of such Cannae Holdings shares (or cause them to be voted) in the same manner as, and in the same proportion to, all shares voted by holders of Cannae Holdings common stock (other than FNF and its subsidiaries), (iii) a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which FNF or its\nsubsidiaries, as applicable, received registration rights with respect to the shares in Cannae held by FNF and (iv) a revolver note with FNF, pursuant to which Cannae Holdings may borrow revolving loans, the proceeds of which may be used for investment purposes and working capital needs, from FNF from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100.0 million. The terms of all of these agreements were initially established while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of FNF, and hence may not be the result of arm's length negotiations.\nWe believe that the terms of these agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements after the Split-Off.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and resulting government response have negatively affected the global economy, the United States economy and the global financial markets, and may disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our Corporate and Other businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and United States economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 and resulting government imposed restrictions on many activities has resulted in an overarching reduction in business activity and financial transactions, an increase in unemployment, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. If such disruption persists for an extended period of time, the businesses comprising our Corporate and Other segment and our ability to consummate new investments could be adversely affected, which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition and technology may erode the Corporate and Other business franchises and result in lower earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEach of the Corporate and Other businesses face intense competitive pressures within markets in which they operate. While we will manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including market and technology changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, future operating results will depend to some degree on whether our Corporate and Other businesses are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages. If our Corporate and Other businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline from current levels.\nThe Corporate and Other businesses, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, are involved in legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporate and Other businesses, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, are involved in pending and threatened litigation matters, some of which include claims for punitive or exemplary damages. These companies are also subject to compliance with extensive government laws and regulations related to employment practices and policies. The Corporate and Other businesses may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to their satisfaction, and these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to their business or operations. The defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive and their outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty. Determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant legal judgment. It is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporate and Other businesses' cash flows in a particular period or on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with, or changes in, laws or regulations applicable to the Corporate and Other businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporate and Other businesses will be subject to certain laws, such as certain environmental laws, takeover laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, escheat or abandoned property laws, and antitrust laws, that may impose requirements on us and them as an affiliated group. As a result, we could become jointly and severally liable for all or part of fines imposed on our Corporate and Other businesses or be fined directly for violations committed by these businesses, and such fines imposed directly on us could be greater than those imposed on such businesses. Compliance with these laws or contracts could also require us to commit significant resources and capital towards information gathering and monitoring thereby increasing our operating costs.\nSimilarly, the Corporate and Other businesses may be subject to contractual obligations that may impose obligations or restrictions on their affiliates. The interpretation of such contractual provisions will depend on local laws. Given that we do not control all of the Corporate and Other businesses and that they generally operate independently of each other, there is a risk that we could contravene one or more of such laws, regulations and contractual arrangements due to limited access and\nopportunities to monitor compliance. In addition, compliance with these laws or contracts could require us to commit significant resources and capital towards information gathering and monitoring thereby increasing our operating costs.\nWe need qualified personnel to manage and operate our Corporate and Other businesses, and any inability to adequately satisfy these needs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our Corporate and Other businesses. Our Corporate and Other businesses also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Changes in demographics, training requirements and the unavailability of qualified personnel could negatively impact our Corporate and Other businesses' ability to meet demands of customers to supply goods and services. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is important to all of our Corporate and Other businesses' operations. Although our Corporate and Other businesses have adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for goods and services may exacerbate the risk of not having sufficient numbers of trained personnel, which could have a negative impact on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur management may seek growth through acquisitions in lines of business that will not necessarily be limited to our current areas of focus or geographic areas. This expansion of our business subjects us to associated risks, such as the diversion of management's attention and lack of experience in operating such businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may make acquisitions in lines of business that are not directly tied to or synergistic with our current portfolio companies. Accordingly, we may in the future acquire businesses in industries or geographic areas with which management is less familiar than we are with our current businesses.\nThe acquisition and integration of any business we may acquire involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired business. Furthermore, acquisitions may: (1) involve our entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience; (2) involve difficulties in retaining the customers of the acquired business; (3) involve difficulties and expense associated with regulatory requirements, competition controls or investigations; (4) result in a delay or reduction of sales for both us and the business we acquire; and (5) disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our current business.\nTo complete future acquisitions, we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions. Moreover, we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings, would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition.\nFurther, an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation and amortization of deferred compensation charges, may require the amortization, write-down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs.\nWe may often pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal or other complexities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an element of our investment strategy, we may pursue unusually complex investment opportunities. This could often take the form of substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity. Our tolerance for complexity may present risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute; it may be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions; and such transactions may sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. Any of these risks could harm our performance.\nThe lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\nWe invest, and will continue to invest, in companies whose securities are not publicly traded and whose securities will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired. In addition, if we are required or otherwise choose to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments. Our investments are often subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale or are otherwise illiquid because there is usually no established trading market for such investments. Because certain of our investments are illiquid, we may be unable to dispose of them timely or we may be unable to do so at a favorable price, and, as a result, we may suffer losses.\nThe loss of key personnel could impair our operating abilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will substantially depend on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management team and officers. If we lose one or more of these key employees, our operating results and in turn the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we will have employment agreements with many of our officers, there can be no assurance that the entire term of the employment agreement will be served or that the employment agreement will be renewed upon expiration.\nThe due diligence process that we undertake in connection with new acquisitions may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment.\nBefore making acquisitions, we will conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an acquisition, we will rely on the resources available to us, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. The due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such opportunity. Moreover, such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment being successful.\nOur commitments to invest in Paysafe/FTAC II, Alight/FTAC, and Trebia may expose us to certain risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have an aggregate commitment of $975.0 million to purchase equity of Paysafe/FTAC II; Alight/FTAC; and Trebia (collectively, such future investment commitments, the \u201cSPAC Commitments\u201d). See discussion under the header Special Purpose Acquisition Companies in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report and under Forward Purchases of Equity of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information on each of our investment commitments.\nThe SPAC Commitments represent a significant portion of the Company\u2019s available working capital and total assets as of December 31, 2020. Our obligation to fund the SPAC Commitments could require the Company to forgo alternative investment opportunities which may arise in the near term. Additionally, while the Company currently has sufficient cash and liquid investments to fulfill our funding obligations, funding the SPAC Commitments could require the Company to raise additional funds through equity financing, liquidating certain of our current investments or by drawing on our available corporate debt facilities in the future. Despite our current financial position and capital resources, we cannot guarantee that the Company will be able to fulfill our obligations to fund the SPAC Commitments.\nFurthermore, we cannot guarantee the success of our ultimate investments in Paysafe, Alight or the ultimate target of Trebia if our obligations to fund these entities pursuant to the SPAC Commitments are fulfilled. Neither our participation as investors in the sponsors and in the common stock of FTAC, FTAC II and Trebia nor the historical performance of our or our Manager\u2019s other investments should be relied upon as an indication of the future performance or potential success of our investments in Paysafe, Alight or the ultimate target of Trebia. We can make no assurances that our investments in these entities upon consummation of their initial business combinations will be successful or that the value of the Company\u2019s investments will appreciate.\nThrough the Company\u2019s initial investments in the sponsors of FTAC, FTAC II and Trebia, and our forward purchase agreements with each, the Company will receive warrants representing the right to purchase common shares of each of Paysafe, Alight and the ultimate target of Trebia at an exercise price of $11.50 per share upon consummation of their initial business combinations. There is no guarantee that such warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless.\nWe expect to enter into similar forward purchase commitments with other SPACs in the near term. Accordingly, such commitments once legally consummated would also be subject to the aformentioned risks.\nOur charter, bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our charter and bylaws and provisions of the Delaware General Corporate Law (\"DGCL\"), could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, as applicable, even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our charter and bylaws: (1) authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by us upon approval of our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive; (2) provide that directors may be removed from office only for cause and that any vacancy on our board of directors may only be filled by a majority of our directors then in office, which may make it difficult for other stockholders to reconstitute our board of directors; (3) provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only upon the request of a majority of our board of directors or by our executive chairman, chief executive officer or president, as applicable; (4) require advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominees; (5) provide that directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by stockholders, which results in each director nominee elected by a plurality winning his or her seat upon receiving one \"for\" vote; and (6) provide that the board of directors is divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with one class being elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, control of Cannae.\nThese restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of our company.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by the occurrence of a catastrophe, including natural or man-made disasters.\nAny catastrophic event, such as pandemic diseases, terrorist attacks, floods, severe storms or hurricanes or computer cyber-terrorism, could have a material and adverse effect on our business in several respects: (1) the outbreak of a pandemic disease, like the novel coronavirus COVID-19, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and the operating results of the Company and our underlying businesses due to its impact on the economy and financial markets; (2) the occurrence of any pandemic disease, natural disaster, terrorist attack or any other catastrophic event that results in our workforce being unable to be physically located at one of our facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our corporate operations; (3) the value of our investment portfolio may decrease if the securities in which we invest are negatively impacted by climate change, pandemic diseases, severe weather conditions and other catastrophic events.", "PERMNO": 17036, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "CNNE"}
