{"cik": "1413837", "company": "First Foundation Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could prevent us from achieving our business objectives and could hurt our future financial performance and the price performance of our common stock. Such risks and uncertainties also could cause our future financial condition and future financial performance to differ significantly from our current expectations, which are described in the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Those risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our ability to control or prevent, include the following:\nRisks Affecting our Business\nWe could incur losses on the loans we make.\nLoan defaults and the incurrence of losses on loans are inherent risks in our business. The incurrence of loan losses necessitate loan charge-offs and write-downs in the carrying values of a banking organization\u2019s loans and, therefore, can adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, our results of operations will be directly affected by the volume and timing of loan losses, which for a number of reasons can vary from period to period. The risks of loan losses are exacerbated by economic recessions and downturns, as evidenced by the substantial magnitude of the loan losses which many banks incurred as a result of the economic recession that commenced in 2008 and continued into 2010, or by other events that can lead to local or regional business downturns. Although an economic recovery in the U.S. has begun, unemployment remains relatively high, as compared to the pre-recessionary period, and there continue to be uncertainties about the strength and sustainability of that economic recovery. If the economic recovery were to remain weak or economic conditions were again to deteriorate, more of our borrowers may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans, in which event loan charge-offs and asset write-downs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur allowance for loan losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors, and may not prove to be adequate to absorb fully the loan losses we incur, in which event our earnings may suffer.\nLike virtually all banks, we follow the practice of maintaining a reserve or allowance for possible loan losses, or ALLL, to absorb loan losses. When it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely, the carrying value of the loan is reduced (\u201cwritten down\u201d) to what management believes is its realizable value or, if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value, the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety (a loan \u201ccharge-off\u201d). Loan write-downs and charge-offs are charged against the ALLL. The amount of the ALLL is increased periodically (i) to replenish the ALLL after it has been reduced due to loan write-downs and charge-offs, (ii) to reflect increases in the volume of outstanding loans, and (iii) to take account of changes in the risk of potential loan losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or adverse changes in economic conditions. Increases in the ALLL are made through a charge, recorded as an expense in the statement of income, referred to as the \u201cprovision for loan losses\u201d and, therefore, can adversely affect earnings.\nOn a quarterly basis, we make determinations with respect to the sufficiency of the ALLL, and the amount of the provisions for loan losses that we believe will be necessary to maintain the sufficiency of the ALLL. We employ economic and loss migration models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines, industry standards and our own historical loan loss experience, as well as a number of more subjective qualitative factors in order to make these determinations. However, making these determinations involve judgments about changes and trends in current economic conditions and other events that can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations to us and a weighting among the quantitative and qualitative factors we consider in determining the sufficiency of the ALLL. If, as a result, or due to the occurrence of unexpected events or circumstances outside of our control or otherwise, those judgments subsequently prove to have been incorrect and, as a result, it becomes necessary to increase the amount of the ALLL, we would have to increase the provisions we make for loan losses, which would reduce our earnings, possibly significantly. In addition, the FDIC and the DBO, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the adequacy of our ALLL. These agencies may require us to make additional provisions for loan losses, over and above the provisions that we have already made, the effect of which also would be to reduce our earnings.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in Southern California could disproportionately harm us.\nThe substantial majority of our clients and the properties securing a large proportion of the loans we make are located in Southern California, where foreclosure rates and unemployment have remained high relative to most other regions of the country. A downturn in economic conditions, or even the continued weakness of the economic recovery in California, or the occurrence of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or fires, which are more common in Southern California than in other parts of the country, could harm our business by:\n\u25cf\nreducing loan demand which, in turn, would lead to reductions in our net interest margins and net interest income;\n\u25cf\nadversely affecting the financial capability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations to us, which could result in increases in loan losses and require us to make additional provisions for loan losses, which would reduce our earnings; and\n\u25cf\ncausing reductions in real property values that, due to our reliance on real properties to collateralize many of our loans, could make it more difficult for us to prevent losses from being incurred on nonperforming loans through the foreclosure and sale of those real properties.\nAdverse changes in economic and market conditions, and changes in government regulations and government monetary policies could materially and negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations are directly affected by factors such as political, economic and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are outside of our ability to control. Deterioration in economic conditions, whether caused by global, national, regional or local concerns or problems, or a further downgrade in the United States debt rating, could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects:\n\u25cf\na deterioration in the credit quality of our banking clients;\n\u25cf\nan increase in loan delinquencies and loan losses;\n\u25cf\nan increase in problem assets and foreclosures\n\u25cf\ndeclines in the values of real properties collateralizing the loans we make;\n\u25cf\nthe need to increase our ALLL;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the value of, or impairment losses which may be incurred with respect to, FFB\u2019s investment securities;\n\u25cf\ndecreases in the demand for our services or financial products;\n\u25cf\nincreases in competition for low cost or non-interest bearing deposits; and\n\u25cf\ndecreases in the investment management and advisory fees we generate.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce our net interest margins and net interest income.\nIncome and cash flows from our banking operations depend to a great extent on the difference. \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cmargin\u201d between the interest we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the rates at which we pay interest on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. However, interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including (among others) general and regional and local economic conditions, the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, bank regulatory requirements, competition from other banks and financial institutions and a change over time in the mix of our loans, investment securities, on the one hand, and on our deposits and other liabilities, on the other hand. Changes in monetary policy will, in particular, influence the origination and market value of and the yields we can realize on loans and investment securities and the interest we pay on deposits. Additionally, sustained low levels of market interest rates, as we have experienced during the past five years, could continue to place downward pressure on our net interest margins and, therefore, on our earnings. Our net interest margins and earnings also could be adversely affected if we are unable to adjust our interest rates on loans and deposits on a timely basis in response to changes in economic conditions or monetary policies. For example, if the rates of interest we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities increase faster than we are able to increase the rates of interest we charge on loans or the yields we realize on investments and other interest-earning assets, our net interest income and, therefore, our earnings will decrease. On the other hand, increasing interest rates generally lead to increases in net interest income; however, such increases also may result in a reduction in loan originations, declines in loan prepayment rates and reductions in the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations, which could result in increased loan defaults and charge-offs and could require increases to our ALLL, thereby offsetting either partially or totally the increases in net interest income resulting from the increase in interest rates. Additionally, we could be prevented from increasing the interest rates we charge on loans or from reducing the interest rates we offer on deposits due to \u201cprice\u201d competition from other banks and financial institutions with which we compete. Conversely, in a declining interest rate environment, our earnings could be adversely affected if the interest rates we are able to charge on loans or other investments decline more quickly than those we pay on deposits and borrowings.\nReal estate loans represent a high percentage of the loans we make, making our results of operations vulnerable to downturns in the real estate market.\nAt December 31, 2014, loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate represented approximately 70% of FFB\u2019s outstanding loans. The repayment of such loans is highly dependent on the ability of the borrowers to meet their loan repayment obligations to us, which can be adversely affected by economic downturns that can lead to (i) declines in the rents and, therefore, in the cash flows generated by those real properties on which the borrowers depend to fund their loan payments to us, and (ii) decreases in the values of those real properties, which make it more difficult for the borrowers to sell those real properties for amounts sufficient to repay their loans in full. As a result, our operating results are more vulnerable to adverse changes in the real estate market than other financial institutions with more diversified loan portfolios and we could incur losses in the event of changes in economic conditions that disproportionately affect the real estate markets.\nLiquidity risk could adversely affect our ability to fund operations and hurt our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our banking business, as we use cash to make loans and purchase investment securities and other interest-earning assets and to fund deposit withdrawals that occur in the ordinary course of our business. Our principal sources of liquidity include earnings, deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank (or FHLB) borrowings, sales of loans or investment securities held for sale, repayments by clients of loans we have made to them, and the proceeds from sales by us of our equity securities or from borrowings that we may obtain. If the ability to obtain funds from these sources becomes limited or the costs of those funds increase, whether due to factors that affect us specifically, including our financial performance, or due to factors that affect the financial services industry in general, including weakening economic conditions or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, then our ability to grow our banking and investment advisory and wealth management businesses would be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur 6 largest deposit clients account for 36% of our total deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our 6 largest bank depositors accounted for, in the aggregate, 36% of our total deposits. As a result, a material decrease in the volume of those deposits by a relatively small number of our depositors could reduce our liquidity, in which event it could became necessary for us to replace those deposits with higher-cost deposits, lower-yielding securities or FHLB borrowings, which would adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, our results of operations.\nAlthough we plan to grow our business by acquiring other banks, there is no assurance that we will succeed in doing so.\nOne of the key elements of our business plan is to grow our banking franchise and increase our market share, and for that reason, we intend to take advantage of opportunities to acquire other banks. However, there is no assurance that we will succeed in doing so. Our ability to execute on our strategy to acquire other banks may require us to raise additional capital and to increase FFB\u2019s capital position to support the growth of our banking franchise, and will also depend on market conditions, over which we have no control. Moreover, any bank acquisitions will require the approval of our bank regulators and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approvals on acceptable terms, if at all.\nGrowing our banking business may not increase our profitability and may adversely affect our future operating results.\nSince we commenced our banking business in October 2007, we have grown our banking franchise by establishing three new wealth management offices in Southern California and one in Las Vegas, Nevada and acquiring two new offices in Palm Desert and El Centro, California as part of our acquisition of Desert Commercial Bank, or DCB, in August 2012. We plan to continue to grow our banking business both organically and through acquisitions of other banks. However, the implementation of our growth strategy poses a number of risks for us, including:\n\u25cf\nthe risk that any newly established wealth management offices will not generate revenues in amounts sufficient to cover the start-up costs of those offices, which would reduce our earnings;\n\u25cf\nthe risk that any bank acquisitions we might consummate in the future will prove not to be accretive to or may reduce our earnings if we do not realize anticipated cost savings or if we incur unanticipated costs in integrating the acquired banks into our operations or if a substantial number of the clients of any of the acquired banks move their banking business to our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe risk that such expansion efforts will divert management time and effort from our existing banking operations, which could adversely affect our future financial performance; and\n\u25cf\nthe risk that the additional capital which we may need to support our growth or the issuance of shares in any bank acquisitions will be dilutive of the investments that our existing shareholders have in the shares of our common stock that they own and in their respective percentage ownership interests they have in the Company.\nWe have obtained, from an unaffiliated bank, a $30.0 million term loan that is secured by a pledge of all of FFB\u2019s shares, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and results of operations and future prospects if we are not able to meet financial covenants applicable to that loan or to repay the loan when it becomes due.\nIn April 2013, we entered into a five year term loan agreement pursuant to which we obtained $7.5 million of borrowings from another bank. We have increased our borrowings under that loan agreement on two occasions: (i) first to $21,875,000 in March 2014, and (ii) then on February 27, 2015 to $30,000,000, at which time the maturity date of the loan was extended from May 1, 2018 to May 1, 2022. We have used the proceeds of the loan primarily to support and fund the growth of our businesses, which included making contributions of equity to FFB and otherwise for working capital purposes. In order to obtain the loan, we were required to pledge 100% of the shares of FFB capital stock to the bank lender as security for our payment obligations under that loan agreement. Additionally, the loan agreement contains a number of financial and other covenants which we are required to meet over the remaining term of the loan. As a result, such borrowings may make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and competitive pressures that could cause us to fail to meet one or more of those financial covenants. If we are unable to meet any of those covenants, we could be required to repay the loan sooner than its maturity date in May 2022; and, if we are unable to repay the loan in full when due, whether at maturity or earlier, the lender will become entitled to sell our FFB shares to recover the amounts that are due it under the loan agreement. Since the stock of FFB comprises our largest and most important asset on which our success is dependent, an inability on our part to repay the loan when due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and would cause us to incur significant losses. See the section below in this report entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Term Loan\u201d for additional information about this loan.\nWe face intense competition from other banks and financial institutions and other wealth and investment management firms that could hurt our business.\nWe conduct our business operations primarily in Southern California, where the banking business is highly competitive and is dominated by large multi-state and in-state banks with operations and offices covering wide geographic areas. We also compete with other financial service businesses, including investment advisory and wealth management firms, mutual fund companies, and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive banking and financial products and services as well as products and services that we do not offer. Larger banks and many of those other financial service organizations have greater financial and marketing resources that enable them to conduct extensive advertising campaigns and to shift resources to regions or activities of greater potential profitability. They also have substantially more capital and higher lending limits, which enable them to attract larger clients and offer financial products and services that we are unable to offer, putting us at a disadvantage in competing with them for loans and deposits and investment management clients. If we are unable to compete effectively with those banking or other financial services businesses, we could find it more difficult to attract new and retain existing clients and our net interest margins, net interest income and investment management advisory fees could decline, which would adversely affect our results of operations and could cause us to incur losses in the future.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully attract and retain investment advisory and wealth management clients is dependent on our ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are not successful in retaining existing and attracting new investment management clients, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of key personnel or inability to attract additional personnel could hurt our future financial performance.\nWe currently depend heavily on the contributions and services provided by Rick Keller, our Executive Chairman, Scott Kavanaugh, Chief Executive Officer of FFI and FFB, John Hakopian, President of FFA, and John Michel, Chief Financial Officer of FFI, FFB and FFA, as well as a number of other key management personnel. Our future success also will depend, in part, on our ability to retain our existing, and attract additional, qualified private banking officers, relationship managers and investment advisory personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. If we are not successful in retaining and attracting key personnel, our ability to retain existing clients or attract new clients could be adversely affected and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could as a result be significantly harmed.\nBanking laws and government regulations may adversely affect our operations, restrict our growth or increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by federal and California state bank regulatory agencies. The primary objective of these agencies is to protect bank depositors and not shareholders, whose respective interests often differ. These regulatory agencies have the legal authority to impose restrictions on us if they believe that is necessary in order to protect depositors, even if those restrictions would adversely affect our ability to grow our business, cause our operating costs to increase, or hinder our ability to compete with less regulated financial services companies.\nWe are also subject to numerous laws and government regulations that are applicable to banks and other financial institutions, including the following:\nConsumer Protection Laws and Regulations. We are required to comply with various consumer protection laws, including the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions.\nBank Secrecy Act and other Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Regulations. As a financial institution, we are required by the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nIf the policies, procedures or systems which we have adopted to comply with these laws and regulations are found by any regulatory or other government agencies to be deficient or we fail to comply with any of these banking laws or regulations, we could be subject to penalties and regulatory actions that may lead to the imposition of restrictions on our ability to grow our banking business. Additionally, a failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious reputational consequences for us. Due, moreover, to the complex and technical nature of many of these laws and government regulations, inadvertent violations may and sometimes do occur. In such an event, we would be required to correct and, depending on the nature and seriousness of the violation, we could be required implement measures to prevent a recurrence of such violations, which could increase our operating costs. If more serious violations were to occur or recur, our banking regulators could limit our activities or growth, fine us, or ultimately put FFB out of business if it was to encounter severe liquidity problems or a significant erosion of capital below the minimum amounts required under applicable regulatory capital guidelines. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.\nThe enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, and the adoption of the new Basel III capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, pose uncertainties for our business and are likely to increase the costs of doing business in the future.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, has significantly changed the U.S. banking laws and regulations that apply to banks and other financial services organizations. Those changes include, among others: (i) the establishment of new requirements and restrictions on derivative and investment activities by banking organizations; (ii) the repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on business checking deposits, (iii) the imposition of limitations on debit card interchange fees, (iv) the promulgation of enhanced financial institution safety and soundness regulations that are applicable to FDIC-insured banks and to their bank holding companies, (v) increases in FDIC deposit insurance coverage and in FDIC insurance premiums that FDIC insured depository institutions are required to pay into the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund, and (vi) the establishment of new banking and financial services regulatory bodies, such as the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, or the BCFP. The BCFP has been granted rulemaking authority over several federal consumer financial protection laws and, in some instances, has the authority to examine and supervise and enforce compliance by banks and other financial service organizations with these laws and regulations. We expect that the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will increase our costs of doing business as well for other banking institutions. We also expect that the repeal of the prohibition on the payment by banks of interest on business checking deposits will result in increased \u201cprice\u201d competition among banks for such deposits, which could increase the costs of funds to us (as well as to other banks) and result in a reduction in our net interest income and earnings in the future.\nIn July 2013, the FRB and the FDIC adopted final rules (the \u201cNew Capital Rules\u201d) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations based on capital guidelines adopted by the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the \u201cBasel Committee\u201d). The rules implement the Basel Committee\u2019s December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards and also certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The New Capital Rules became effective for FFI and FFB on January 1, 2015 (subject in the case of certain of those rules to phase-in periods). The New Capital Rules have substantially revised and heightened the risk-based capital requirements applicable to U.S. banking organizations, including FFI and FFB, from the U.S. risk-based capital rules that were in effect prior to January 1, 2015 and instituted a new and more risk-sensitive approach for risk-weighting a banking organization\u2019s assets which could have the practical effect of making it more difficult for banks and bank holding companies to meet the new risk-based capital requirements. These new Capital Rules will increase the amount of capital which both FFI and FFB, as well as other banks and bank holding companies in the United States, will have to maintain and it is expected that the new rules will also increase the costs of capital for bank holding companies and banks in the United States. See \u201cBUSINESS--Supervision and Regulation-First Foundation Bank-New Basel III Capital Requirements\u201d above in this report for additional information regarding these new capital requirements.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was $138.3 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence and cause adverse changes to occur in the fair values of securities in that portfolio. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuers of the securities, concerns with respect to the enforceability of the payment or other key terms of the securities, changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, as well as others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, the process for determining whether an impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments, which could subsequently prove to have been wrong, regarding the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer of the security, the fair value of any collateral underlying the security and whether and the extent to which the principal of and interest on the security will ultimately be paid in accordance with its payment terms.\nPremiums for federal deposit insurance have increased and may increase even more.\nThe FDIC uses the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, to cover insured deposits in the event of bank failures, and maintains that Fund by assessing insurance premiums on FDIC-insured banks and other FDIC-insured depository institutions. As a result of (i) increases in bank failures during the three years ended December 31, 2010 which caused the DIF to fall below the minimum balance required by law, and (ii) an increase, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, in the minimum balance required to be maintained in the DIF, the FDIC has raised the insurance premiums assessed on FDIC-insured banks in order to rebuild the DIF. Depending on the frequency and severity of bank failures in the future, the FDIC may further increase such premiums. In addition, our FDIC insurance premiums will increase as and to the extent that our banking business grows. Such increases in FDIC insurance premiums would increase our costs of doing business and, therefore, could adversely affect our results of operations and earnings in the future.\nTechnology and marketing costs may negatively impact our future operating results.\nThe financial services industry is constantly undergoing technological changes in the types of products and services provided to clients to enhance client convenience. Our future success will depend upon our ability to address the changing technological needs of our clients and to compete with other financial services organizations which have successfully implemented new technologies. The costs of implementing technological changes, new product development and marketing costs may increase our operating expenses without a commensurate increase in our business or revenues, in which event our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security, and cyber-security attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients and that may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of confidential information belonging to us or personal or confidential information belonging to our clients, misappropriation of assets, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check \u201ckiting\u201d or fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, \u201cphishing\u201d and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to data processing or data storage systems used by us or by our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. We have been seeing increases in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, including in the commercial banking sector, as cyber-criminals have been targeting commercial bank and brokerage accounts on an increasing basis. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial service organizations and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only their confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their clients or customers and their employees, and subjecting those corporations to potential fraudulent activity and their clients and customers to identity theft and fraudulent activity in their credit card and banking accounts. Therefore, security breaches and cyber-attacks can cause significant increases in operating costs, including the costs of compensating clients and customers for any resulting losses they may incur and the costs and capital expenditures required to correct the deficiencies in and strengthen the security of data processing and storage systems.\nAlthough we invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and we conduct periodic tests of our security systems and processes, there is no assurance that we will succeed in anticipating or adequately protecting against or preventing all security breaches and cyber-attacks from occurring due to a number of possible causes, many of which will be outside of our control, including the changing nature and increasing frequency of such attacks, the increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals, and possible weaknesses that go undetected in our data systems notwithstanding the testing we conduct of those systems. If we are unable to detect or prevent a security breach or cyber-attack from occurring, then, we and our clients could incur losses or damages; and we could sustain damage to our reputation, lose clients and business, suffer disruptions to our business and incur increased operating costs, and be exposed to additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties and to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe rely on communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology and related services from third-party service providers and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer an interruption in those systems.\nWe rely heavily on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology, including our internet banking services and data processing systems. Any failure or interruption of, or security breaches in, these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our operations or in the client services we provide. Additionally, interruptions in service and security breaches could damage our reputation, lead existing clients to terminate their business relationships with us, make it more difficult for us to attract new clients and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possibly financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur ability to attract and retain clients and key employees could be adversely affected if our reputation is harmed.\nThe ability of FFB and FFA to attract and retain clients and key employees could be adversely affected if our reputation is harmed. Any actual or perceived failure to address various issues could cause reputational harm, including a failure to address any of the following types of issues: legal and regulatory requirements; the proper maintenance or protection of the privacy of client and employee financial or other personal information; record keeping deficiencies or errors; money-laundering; potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues. Moreover, any failure to appropriately address any issues of this nature could give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, and legal risks, which could lead to costly litigation or subject us to enforcement actions, fines, or penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses. In addition, our banking, investment advisory and wealth management businesses are dependent on the integrity of our banking personnel and our investment advisory and wealth managers. Lapses in integrity could cause reputational harm to our businesses that could lead to the loss of existing clients and make it more difficult for us to attract new clients and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may incur significant losses due to ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposures through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational and compliance systems, and internal control and management review processes. However, those systems and review processes and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and, as a result, we may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes, particularly in the event of the kinds of dislocations in market conditions experienced over the last several years, which highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. If those systems and review processes prove to be ineffective in identifying and managing risks, we could be subjected to increased regulatory scrutiny and regulatory restrictions could be imposed on our business, including on our growth, as a result of which our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real properties that we may acquire.\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we acquire, by or in lieu of foreclosure, real properties which collateralize nonperforming loans (often referred to as \u201cReal Estate Owned\u201d or \u201cREO\u201d). As an owner of such properties, we could become subject to environmental liabilities and incur substantial costs for any property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up that may be required due to any environmental contamination that may be found to exist at any of those properties, even if we did not engage in the activities that led to such contamination and those activities took place prior to our ownership of the properties. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties seeking damages for environmental contamination emanating from the site. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur investment advisory and wealth management business may be negatively impacted by changes in economic and market conditions.\nOur investment advisory and wealth management business may be negatively impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions because the performance of that business is directly affected by conditions in the financial and securities markets. The performance of the financial markets and the businesses operating in the securities industry can be highly volatile within relatively short periods of time and is directly affected by, among other factors, domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, and by the threat, as well as the occurrence, of global conflicts, all of which are beyond our ability to control. We cannot assure you that broad market performance will be favorable in the future. Declines or a lack of sustained growth in the financial markets may adversely affect the market value and performance of the investment securities that we manage, which could lead to reductions in our investment management and advisory fees and, therefore, may result in a decline in the performance of our investment advisory and wealth management business. Additionally, if FFA\u2019s performance were to decline, that could lead some of our clients to reduce their assets under management by us and make it more difficult for us to retain existing clients and attract new clients. If any of these events or circumstances were to occur, the operating results of our investment advisory and wealth management business and, therefore, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe investment management contracts we have with our clients are terminable without cause and on relatively short notice by our clients, which makes us vulnerable to short term declines in the performance of the securities under our management.\nLike most investment advisory and wealth management businesses, the investment advisory contracts we have with our clients are typically terminable by the client without cause upon less than 30 days\u2019 notice. As a result, even short term declines in the performance of the securities we manage, which can result from factors outside our control, such as adverse changes in market or economic condition or the poor performance of some of the investments we have recommended to our clients, could lead some of our clients to move assets under our management to other asset classes such as broad index funds or treasury securities, or to investment advisors which have investment product offerings or investment strategies different than ours. Therefore, our operating results are heavily dependent on the financial performance of our investment portfolios and the investment strategies we employ in our investment advisory businesses and even short-term declines in the performance of the investment portfolios we manage for our clients, whatever the cause, could result in a decline in assets under management and a corresponding decline in investment management fees, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe market for investment managers is extremely competitive and the loss of a key investment manager to a competitor could adversely affect our investment advisory and wealth management business.\nWe believe that investment performance is one of the most important factors that affect the amount of assets under our management and, for that reason, the success of FFA\u2019s business is heavily dependent on the quality and experience of our investment managers and their track records in terms of making investment decisions that result in attractive investment returns for our clients. However, the market for such investment managers is extremely competitive and is increasingly characterized by frequent movement of investment managers among different firms. In addition, our individual investment managers often have direct contact with particular clients, which can lead to a strong client relationship based on the client\u2019s trust in that individual manager. As a result, the loss of a key investment manager to a competitor could jeopardize our relationships with some of our clients and lead to the loss of client accounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFFA\u2019s business is highly regulated, and the regulators have the ability to limit or restrict, and impose fines or other sanctions on, FFA\u2019s business.\nFFA is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act and its business is highly regulated. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational and disclosure obligations. Moreover, the Investment Advisers Act grants broad administrative powers to regulatory agencies such as the SEC to regulate investment advisory businesses. If the SEC or other government agencies believe that FFA has failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, these agencies have the power to impose fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions, which could include revocation of FFA\u2019s registration under the Investment Advisers Act. We are also subject to the provisions and regulations of ERISA to the extent that we act as a \u201cfiduciary\u201d under ERISA with respect to certain of our clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws, impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of each ERISA plan which is a client, as well as certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) to such plans. Additionally, like other investment advisory and wealth management companies, FFA also faces the risks of lawsuits by clients. The outcome of regulatory proceedings and lawsuits is uncertain and difficult to predict. An adverse resolution of any regulatory proceeding or lawsuit against FFA could result in substantial costs or reputational harm to FFA and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on the ability of FFA to retain key relationship and wealth managers, and to retain existing clients or attract new clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements also could adversely affect FFA\u2019s operations and financial results, by, among other things, increasing its operating expenses and placing restrictions on the marketing of certain investment products. Recently, the Obama Administration directed the U.S. Department of Labor to adopt new rules that would require some financial advisors to act as \u201cfiduciaries\u201d for their clients in connection with the management of 401-K retirement plan and IRA investments, which is a higher standard than currently applies to investment managers and brokers when managing investments in 401-K retirement plans and IRAs. We cannot predict whether these new rules will be adopted and we do not have enough information at this time to determine whether these proposed new rules, if adopted, will apply to FFA or will have an impact on FFA\u2019s business or operating results. However, we expect that these rules, if adopted, would apply primarily to investment advisors and brokers who receive commissions from the issuers of investment securities that are purchased, based on the advice of such advisors or brokers, for the accounts of their clients. FFA, by contrast, is compensated for its services primarily by investment advisory fees paid directly by its clients based on the market value of the investment securities that are managed by FFA for them and not by commissions paid by issuers of those investment securities.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of certain securities brokerage firms.\nFFA does not provide custodial services for its clients. Instead, client investment accounts are maintained under custodial arrangements with large, well established securities brokerage firms, either directly or through arrangements made by FFA with those firms. As a result, the performance of, or even rumors or questions about the integrity or performance of, any of those brokerage firms could adversely affect the confidence of FFA\u2019s clients in the services provided by those firms or otherwise adversely impact their custodial holdings. Such an occurrence could negatively impact the ability of FFA to retain existing or attract new clients and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe do not plan to pay dividends for at least the foreseeable future. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends is subject to statutory, regulatory and other restrictions.\nIn order to support and fund the growth of our banking business, it is our policy to retain cash rather than pay dividends. As a result, we have not paid any cash dividends since FFB commenced its banking operations in October 2007 and we have no plans to pay cash dividends at least for the foreseeable future. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is restricted by California and federal law and the policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve, which is our federal banking regulator. Moreover, the agreement governing the $30.0 million term loan that we obtained from an unaffiliated bank lender, prohibits us from paying cash dividends to our shareholders without the lender\u2019s prior written consent. See the section of this report below, entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Term Loan,\u201d for additional information about this loan.\nOur ability to pay dividends to shareholders is also dependent on the payment to us of cash dividends by FFA and FFB. FFA and FFB are corporations that are separate and distinct from us and, as a result, they are subject to separate statutory or regulatory dividend restrictions that can affect their ability to pay cash dividends to us. FFA\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends to us is restricted under California corporate law. FFB\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us is limited by various banking statutes and regulations. Moreover, based on their assessment of the financial condition of FFB or other factors, the FDIC or the California DBO could find that payment of cash dividends by FFB to us would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice, in which event they could restrict FFB from paying cash dividends, even if FFB meets the statutory requirements to do so. See the section entitled \u201cDividend Policy and Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends\u201d in Item 5 of this report below for additional information about our dividend policy and the dividend restrictions that apply to us and to FFB and FFA.\nThe Company\u2019s shares have been limited and there is no assurance that a more active trading market for our shares will develop in the future. As a result, shareholders may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at attractive prices if and when they need or desire to do so.\nOn November 3, 2014, our common stock was listed and commenced trading on the NASDAQ Global Stock Market, under the ticker symbol \u201cFFWM\u201d. However, the trading volume in our common stock has been limited. For example, the average daily trading volume of our shares on NASDAQ during the month of February 2015 was approximately 12,410 shares. There can be no assurance that a more active trading market for our shares will develop or can be sustained in the future. If a more active trading market does not develop, or cannot be sustained, our shareholders may have difficulty selling their shares at attractive prices when they need or desire to do so. Additionally, the lack of an active trading market for our shares may make it more difficult for us to sell shares in the future to raise additional capital and to offer our shares as consideration for acquisitions of other banks or investment management or other financial services businesses, without diluting our existing shareholders.\nThe market prices and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nEven if an active market develops for our common stock, the market prices of our common stock may be volatile and the trading volume may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that, if a market does develop for our common stock, the market prices of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the prices of ours shares or result in fluctuations in those prices or in trading volume of our common stock could include the following, many of which are outside of our control:\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in our operating results or in the quality of our earnings or assets;\n\u25cf\noperating results that differ from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u25cf\nthe operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u25cf\nthe implementation of our growth strategy and performance of acquired businesses that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf\nthe enactment of new more costly government regulations that are applicable to our businesses or the imposition of regulatory restrictions on us;\n\u25cf\nour dividend policy and any changes that might occur to that policy in the future;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales of by us of our common stock or any other of our equity securities;\n\u25cf\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as changes in interest rates or fluctuations in stock, commodity or real estate valuations; and\n\u25cf\nannouncements of strategic developments, material acquisitions and other material events in our business or in the businesses of our competitors.\nShare ownership by our officers and directors and certain agreements may make it more difficult for third parties to acquire us or effectuate a change of control that might be viewed favorably by other shareholders.\nAs of February 27, 2015, our executive officers and directors owned, in the aggregate, approximately 34% of our outstanding shares. As a result, if the officers and directors were to oppose a third party\u2019s acquisition proposal for, or a change in control of, FFI, the officers and directors may have sufficient voting power to be able to block or at least delay such an acquisition or change in control from taking place, even if other shareholders would support such a sale or change of control. In addition, a number of FFI\u2019s officers have change of control agreements which could increase the costs and, therefore, lessen the attractiveness of an acquisition of FFI to a potential acquiring party. For additional information regarding these change of control agreements, see the Item 11, entitled \u201cExecutive Compensation\u201d below in this report.\nOur corporate governance documents, and certain corporate and banking laws applicable to us, could make a takeover attempt, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, more difficult.\nOur Board of Directors, or Board, has the power under our articles of incorporation to issue additional shares of common stock and create and authorize the sale of one or more series of preferred stock without having to obtain shareholder approval for such action. As a result, our Board could authorize the issuance of shares of a series of preferred stock to implement a shareholders rights plan (often referred to as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d) or could sell and issue preferred shares with special voting rights or conversion rights, which could deter or delay attempts by our shareholders to remove or replace management, and attempts of third parties either to engage in proxy contests or to acquire control of FFI. In addition, our charter documents:\n\u25cf\nenable our Board to fill any vacancy on the Board, unless the vacancy was created by the removal of a director;\n\u25cf\nenable our Board to amend our bylaws without shareholder approval, subject to certain exceptions; and\n\u25cf\nrequire compliance with an advance notice procedure with regard to any business that is to be brought by a shareholder before an annual or special meeting of shareholders and with regard to the nomination by shareholders of candidates for election as directors.\nFurthermore, federal and state banking laws and regulations applicable to us require anyone seeking to acquire more than 10% of our outstanding shares or otherwise effectuate a change of control of the Company or of FFB, to file an application with, and to receive approval from, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to do so. These laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control of the Company, including by means of a transaction in which our shareholders might receive a premium over the market price of our common stock.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock in the future which could result in dilution to our shareholders.\nA total of approximately 12 million authorized but unissued shares of our common stock are available for future sale and issuance by action of our board of directors alone. Accordingly, if we were to sell additional shares in the future, our shareholders could suffer dilution in their investment in their shares of our common stock and in their percentage ownership of the Company.\nWe may elect under the JOBS Act to use an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. That Act allows us, as an emerging growth company, to take advantage of extended transition periods for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. As a result, we will not be required to comply with new or revised accounting standards (i) until those standards apply to private companies, even if that is later than the date or dates on which they become effective for public companies or (ii) if sooner, until we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be fully comparable to the financial statements of public companies that contain new or revised accounting standards not yet applicable to private companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe reduced disclosures and relief from certain other significant disclosure requirements that are available to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we are entitled to exemptions from certain reporting requirements that apply to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include the following:\n\u25cf\nAn exemption from the requirements of the Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires public companies that are accelerated filers or large accelerated filers (within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act) to obtain and include in their annual reports on Form 10-K an attestation report from their independent registered public accountants with respect to the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting;\n\u25cf\nless extensive disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our proxy statements or other periodic reports that we file with the SEC; and\n\u25cf\nexemptions from the requirements to have our shareholders vote, on an advisory and nonbinding basis, on executive compensation and on any golden parachute payments.\nIn addition, even if we choose voluntarily to comply with any of the requirements from which we are exempt, we may later rely on those exemptions to avail ourselves of the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies.\nWe may remain an emerging growth company for the period ending in December 2018, although we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of that period, it is determined that we have become a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700 million).\nBecause we will be relying on one or more of these exemptions, investors and securities analysts may find it more difficult to evaluate our common stock, and some investors may find our common stock less attractive, and, as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock than would be the case if we were not an emerging growth company, which could result in a reductions the trading volume and greater volatility in the prices of our common stock.\nA failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock prices.\nAlthough, as an emerging growth company, we are not required to obtain or include in our annual reports on Form 10-K an attestation report from their independent registered accountants with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, like all other public companies, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer are required, annually, to assess, and disclose their findings in our annual reports on Form 10-K with respect to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in a manner that meets the requirements of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation, which could significantly increase our operating expenses. See Item 9A of this report below, entitled \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d to review the attestation report of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.\nAdditionally, If we are unable to maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis. In such an event, investors and clients may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, as a result of which our liquidity, access to capital markets, and perceptions of our creditworthiness could be adversely affected and the market prices of our common stock could decline. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC, or the Federal Reserve, or other regulatory authorities, which could require us to expend additional financial and management resources. As a result, an inability to maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOther Risks and Uncertainties.\nAdditional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects.", "PERMNO": 15064, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FFWM"}
