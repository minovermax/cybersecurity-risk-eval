Risk Factors\nShareholders should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained herein. We operate globally in challenging and highly competitive markets and thus our business is subject to a variety of risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Helix. We are subject to a variety of risks that affect many other companies generally, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that, as of the date of this Annual Report, we believe are not as significant as the risks described below. You should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nMarket and Industry Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could continue to disrupt our operations and adversely impact our business and financial results.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The nature of COVID-19 led to worldwide shutdowns and halting of commercial and interpersonal activity, as governments around the world imposed regulations in efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 such as shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar restrictions. As of December 31, 2020, efforts to contain COVID-19 have not succeeded in many regions, and the global pandemic remains ongoing. Furthermore, although vaccines have been identified, their efficacy and rollout pose logistical and other challenges, and new strains of coronavirus have been identified that may be more contagious, more severe, and for which vaccinations may not be effective. As a result the global economy has been marked by significant slowdown and uncertainty, which led to a precipitous decline in oil prices in response to demand concerns, as further discussed throughout these Risk Factors. These events have resulted in significantly weaker outlook for oil producers and by extension oilfield service companies, including reduced operating and capital budgets as well as market confidence in overall industry viability. We are not currently able to predict the duration or severity of the spread of COVID-19 or the responses thereto, and if economic and industry conditions do not improve, these events will continue to adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19 to one or more of our locations, including our vessels, could significantly impact our operations. We have implemented various protocols for both onshore and offshore personnel in efforts to limit the impact of COVID-19, however those may not prove fully successful. The spread of COVID-19 to our onshore workforce could prevent us from supporting our offshore operations, we may experience reduced productivity as our onshore personnel work remotely, and any spread to our key management personnel may disrupt our business. Any outbreak on our vessels may result in the vessel, or some or all of a vessel crew (including customer crew), being quarantined and therefore impede the vessel's ability to generate revenue. We have experienced several instances of COVID-19 among our offshore crew, and although to date we have managed to minimize operational disruption, there can be no guarantee that will remain the case. We have experienced challenges in connection with our offshore crew changes due to health and travel restrictions related to COVID-19, and those challenges and/or restrictions may continue or worsen.\nOur business is adversely affected by low oil and gas prices, which occur in a cyclical oil and gas market that is currently experiencing significant volatility.\nOur services are substantially dependent upon the condition of the oil and gas market, and in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital and other expenditures for offshore exploration, development, drilling and production operations. Although our services are used for other operations during the entire lifecycle of a well, when industry conditions are unfavorable such as the current environment, oil and gas companies will likely continue to reduce their budgets for expenditures on all types of operations, and will defer certain activities to the extent possible.\nThe price war among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other non-OPEC producer nations (collectively with OPEC members, \u201cOPEC+\u201d) during the first quarter 2020 and global storage considerations significantly contributed to the slowdown and uncertainty in the global economy. The confluence of these events along with the continued impact of COVID-19 has resulted in a significantly weaker outlook for oil producers and by extension oilfield service companies, including reduced operating and capital budgets as well as market confidence in overall industry viability. We are not currently able to predict the duration or severity of the continued oil price volatility or the responses thereto, and if economic and industry conditions do not improve, these events will continue to adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe levels of both capital and operating expenditures largely depend on the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices, which is influenced by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022worldwide economic activity and general economic and business conditions, including access to global capital and capital markets;\n\u2022the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest, including regional conflicts and economic and political conditions in oil-producing regions;\n\u2022actions taken by OPEC and/or OPEC+;\n\u2022the availability and discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas;\n\u2022the exploration and production of onshore shale oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the cost of offshore exploration for and production and transportation of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the level of excess production capacity;\n\u2022the ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain external capital for capital projects and production operations;\n\u2022the environmental and social sustainability of the oil and gas sector and the perception thereof, including within the investing community;\n\u2022the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases globally;\n\u2022governmental restrictions on oil and gas leases, including executive actions taken with respect to permitting in connection with oil and gas leases on federal land announced in January 2021;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy exploration, production, transportation and consumption;\n\u2022potential acceleration of the development of alternative fuels;\n\u2022shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas or renewable energy alternatives;\n\u2022weather conditions, natural disasters, and epidemic and pandemic diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022laws, regulations and policies directly related to the industries in which we provide services, and their interpretation and enforcement;\n\u2022environmental and other governmental regulations; and\n\u2022tax laws, regulations and policies.\nA prolonged period of low level of activity by offshore oil and gas operators may continue to adversely affect demand for our services, the utilization and/or rates we can achieve for our assets and services, and the outlook for our industry in general, all of which could lead to an even greater surplus of available vessels or similar assets and therefore increasingly downward pressure on the rates we can charge for our services. Given that our business is adversely affected by low oil prices, especially the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital and other expenditures for offshore exploration, development, drilling and production operations, the persistence of current conditions would negatively impact those companies\u2019 willingness and ability to make those expenditures. Additionally, our customers, in reaction to negative market conditions, may continue to seek to negotiate contracts at lower rates, both during and at the expiration of the term of our contracts, to cancel earlier work and shift it to later periods, or to cancel their contracts with us even if cancellation involves their paying a cancellation fee. The extent of the impact of these conditions on our results of operations and cash flows depends on the length and severity of an unfavorable industry environment and the potential decreased demand for our services.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe majority of our current backlog is concentrated in a small number of long-term contracts that we may fail to renew or replace.\nAlthough historically our service contracts were of relatively short duration, over recent years we have entered into longer term contracts, including the five-year contract with BP for work in the Gulf of Mexico, the two four-year contracts with Petrobras for well intervention services offshore Brazil and the seven-year contract for the HP I. As of December 31, 2020, the BP contract, the Petrobras contracts and the contract for the HP I represented approximately 69% of our total backlog. Any cancellation, termination or breach of those contracts would have a larger impact on our operating results and financial condition than of our shorter term contracts. In addition, the BP contract and the Petrobras contracts expire in 2021 and the contract for the HP I expires in 2023. Our ability to extend, renew or replace these contracts when they expire or obtain new contracts as alternatives, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of our customers. Given the historically cyclical nature of the oil and gas market, we may not be able to extend, renew or replace the contracts or we may be required to extend, renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at rates that are below our existing contract rates, or that have other terms that are less favorable to us than our existing contracts. Failure to extend, renew or replace expiring contracts or secure new contracts at comparable rates and with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur current backlog may not be ultimately realized for various reasons, and our contracts may be terminated early.\nAs of December 31, 2020, backlog for our services supported by written agreements or contracts totaled $407 million, of which $301 million is expected to be performed in 2021. We may incur capital costs, we may charter vessels for the purpose of performing these contracts, and/or we may forgo or not seek other contracting opportunities in light of these contracts.\nWe may not be able to perform under our contracts for various reasons giving our customers certain contractual rights under their contracts with us, which ultimately could include termination of a contract. In addition, our customers may seek to cancel, terminate, suspend or renegotiate our contracts in the event of our customers\u2019 diminished demand for our services due to global or industry conditions affecting our customers and their own revenues. Some of these contracts provide for a cancellation fee that is substantially less than the expected rates from the contracts. In addition, some of our customers could experience liquidity issues or could otherwise be unable or unwilling to perform under a contract, in which case a customer may repudiate or seek to cancel or renegotiate the contract. The repudiation, early cancellation, termination or renegotiation of our contracts by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations involve numerous risks, which could result in our inability or failure to perform operationally under our contracts and result in reduced revenues, contractual penalties and/or contract termination.\nOur equipment and services are very technical and the offshore environment poses its own challenges. Performing the work we do pursuant to the terms of our contracts can be difficult for various reasons, including equipment failure or reduced performance, human error, third-party failure or other fault, design flaws, weather, water currents or soil conditions. In particular, our assets may experience challenges operating in new locations, presenting incremental complications; any of these factors could lead to performance concerns. The nature of offshore operations requires our offshore crew members as well as our customers and vendors to periodically travel to and from the vessels. The occurrence or threat of an epidemic or pandemic disease, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any related governmental regulations or other travel restrictions or safety measures, may impede our ability to execute such crewing or crew changes, which could lead to vessel downtime or suspension of operations, which may be beyond our control. Failure to perform in accordance with contract specifications can result in reduced rates (or zero rates), contractual penalties, and ultimately, termination in the event of sustained non-performance. Reduced revenues and/or contract termination due to our inability or failure to perform operationally could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers and other counterparties may be unable to perform their obligations.\nContinued industry uncertainty and domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of our customers, lenders, insurers and other financial institutions generally, could jeopardize the ability of such parties to perform their obligations to us, including obligations to pay amounts owed to us. In the event one or more of our customers is adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise by the current market environment, our business with them may be affected. In this current uncertain environment, we may face an increased risk of customers deferring work, declining to commit to new work, asserting claims of force majeure and/or terminating contracts, or our customers\u2019, subcontractors\u2019 or partners\u2019 inability to make payments or remain solvent.\nAlthough we assess the creditworthiness of our counterparties, a variety of conditions and factors could lead to changes in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity and increase our exposure to credit risk and bad debts. In particular, our robotics business unit tends to do business with smaller customers that may not be capitalized to the same extent as larger operators and/or that may be more exposed to financial loss in an uncertain economic environment. In addition, we may offer favorable payment or other contractual terms to customers in order to secure contracts. These circumstances may lead to more frequent collection issues. Our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected and we could incur losses.\nOur forward-looking statements assume that our customers, lenders, insurers and other financial institutions will be able to fulfill their obligations under our various contracts, credit agreements and insurance policies. The inability of our customers and other counterparties to perform under these agreements may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may own assets with ongoing costs that cannot be recouped if the assets are not under contract, and time chartering vessels requires us to make ongoing payments regardless of utilization of and revenue generation from those vessels.\nWe own vessels and equipment for which there are ongoing costs, including maintenance, manning, insurance and depreciation. We may also construct assets without first obtaining service contracts covering the cost of those assets. Our failure to secure contracts for vessels or other assets could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, we charter our ROV support vessels under time charter agreements. We also have entered into long-term charter agreements for the Siem Helix 1 and Siem Helix 2 vessels to perform work under our contracts with Petrobras. Should our contracts with customers be canceled, terminated or breached and/or if we do not secure work for the chartered vessels, we are still required to make charter payments. Making those payments absent revenue generation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAsset upgrade, modification, refurbishment, repair, dry dock and construction projects, and customer contractual acceptance of vessels and equipment, are subject to risks, including delays, cost overruns, loss of revenue and failure to commence or maintain contracts.\nWe incur significant upgrade, modification, refurbishment, repair and dry dock expenditures on our existing fleet from time to time. We also construct or make capital improvements to other pieces of equipment. While some of these capital projects are planned, some are unplanned. Additionally, as assets age, they are more likely to be subject to higher maintenance and repair activities. These projects are subject to the many risks, including delay and cost overruns, inherent in any large capital project.\nActual capital expenditures could materially exceed our estimated or planned capital expenditures. Moreover, assets undergoing upgrades, modifications, refurbishment, repair or dry docks may not earn revenue during the period they are out of service. Any significant period of such unplanned activity for our assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, delays in the delivery of vessels and other assets being constructed or undergoing upgrades, modifications, refurbishment, repair, or dry docks may result in delay in customer acceptance and/or contract commencement, resulting in a loss of revenue and cash flow to us, and may cause our customers to seek to terminate or shorten the terms of their contracts with us and/or seek damages under applicable contract terms. In the event of termination or modification of a contract due to late delivery, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on favorable terms, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive. An oversupply of offshore drilling rigs coupled with a significant slowdown in industry activities results in increased competition from drilling rigs as well as substantially lower rates on work that is being performed. Several of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial and other resources to better withstand a prolonged period of difficult industry conditions. In order to compete for customers, these larger competitors may undercut us substantially by reducing rates to levels we are unable to withstand. Further, certain other companies may seek to compete with us by hiring vessels of opportunity from which to deploy modular systems and/or be willing to take on additional risks. If other companies relocate or acquire assets for operations in the regions in which we operate, levels of competition may increase further and our business could be adversely affected.\nThe actual or perceived lack of sustainability of the oil and gas sector, or our failure to adequately implement and communicate ESG initiatives that demonstrate our own sustainability, may adversely affect our business.\nSustainability and ESG initiatives have become an increasingly important factor in assessing a company\u2019s outlook, as investors look to identify factors that they believe inform a company\u2019s ability to create long-term value. We understand we have an important role to play as a steward of the people, communities and environments we serve, and we regularly look for ways to emphasize and improve our own ESG record. However the nature of the oil and gas sector in which we predominantly operate may impact in the near or long term sustainability sentiment of investors, lenders, other industry participants and individuals, as the global markets shift towards green energy and environmental conservation. This sentiment may in turn lead to a lack of investment, investability or borrowing capital, or a more negative overall perception related to the fossil fuel industry. Further, we may not succeed in implementing or communicating an ESG message that is well understood or received. As a result we may experience diminished reputation or sentiment, reduced access to capital markets and/or increased cost of capital, an inability to attract and retain talent, and loss of customers or vendors.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property or other technology may adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is highly technical. We utilize and rely on a variety of advanced assets and other tools, such as our vessels, DP systems, IRSs, SILs, ROAM, ROVs and ROVDrill, to provide customers with services designed to meet the technological challenges of their subsea activities worldwide. In some instances we hold intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) rights related to our business. We rely significantly on proprietary technology, processes and other information that are not subject to IP protection, as well as IP licensed from third parties. We employ confidentiality agreements to protect our IP and other proprietary information, and we have management systems in place designed to protect our legal and contractual rights. We may be subject to, among other things, theft or other misappropriation of our IP and other proprietary information, challenges to the validity or enforceability of our or our licensors\u2019 IP rights, and breaches of confidentiality obligations. These risks are heightened by the global nature of our business, as effective protections may be limited in certain jurisdictions. Although we endeavor to identify and protect our IP and other confidential or proprietary information as appropriate, there can be no assurance that these measures will succeed. Such a failure could result in an interruption in our operations, increased competition, unplanned capital expenditures, and exposure to claims. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive position, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur North Sea business typically declines in the winter, and weather can adversely affect our operations.\nMarine operations conducted in the North Sea are seasonal and depend, in part, on weather conditions. Historically, we have enjoyed our highest North Sea vessel utilization rates during the summer and fall when weather conditions are favorable for offshore operations, and we typically have experienced our lowest North Sea utilization rates in the first quarter. As is common in our industry, we may bear the risk of delays caused by adverse weather conditions. Our results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.\nCertain areas in which we operate experience unfavorable weather conditions including hurricanes and extreme storms on a relatively frequent basis. Substantially all of our facilities and assets offshore and along the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea are susceptible to damage and/or total loss by these weather conditions. Damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas could potentially cause us to adjust service operations or curtail operations for significant periods of time until damage can be assessed and repaired. Moreover, even if we do not experience direct damage from any of these weather conditions, we may experience disruptions in our operations because customers may adjust their offshore activities due to damage to their assets, platforms, pipelines and other related facilities.\nThe operation of marine vessels is risky, and we do not have insurance coverage for all risks.\nVessel-based offshore services involve a high degree of operational risk. Hazards, such as vessels sinking, grounding, colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions, are inherent in marine operations. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. Damage arising from such occurrences may result in assertions of our liability. Insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. A successful liability claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, insurance carriers require broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist acts, and limitations for wind storm damage. The current insurance on our assets is in amounts approximating replacement value. In the event of property loss due to a catastrophic disaster, mechanical failure, collision or other event, insurance may not cover a substantial loss of revenue, increased costs and other liabilities, and therefore the loss of any of our assets could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur oil and gas operations involve a high degree of operational, contractual and financial risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage, loss of equipment and environmental incidents.\nIn January 2019 we began owning oil and gas properties as part of our strategy to secure utilization for our vessels and other equipment. Engaging in oil and gas production and transportation operations subjects us to certain risks inherent in the operation of oil and gas wells, including but not limited to uncontrolled flows of oil, gas, brine or well fluids into the environment; blowouts; cratering; pipeline or other facility ruptures; mechanical difficulties or other equipment malfunction; fires, explosions or other physical damage; hurricanes, storms and other natural disasters and weather conditions; and pollution and other environmental damage; any of which could result in substantial losses to us. Although we maintain insurance against some of these risks we cannot insure against all possible losses. Furthermore, such operations necessarily involve some degree of contractual counterparty risk, including for the transportation, marketing and sale of such production, and to the extent we have partners in any of the properties we own or operate. As a result, any damage or loss not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us.\nConsistent with standard industry practice, we typically obtain contractual indemnification from our customers whereby they agree to protect and indemnify us for liabilities resulting from various hazards associated with offshore operations. We can provide no assurance, however, that we will obtain such contractual indemnification or that our customers will be willing or financially able to meet their indemnification obligations.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. subject us to additional risks.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022the loss of revenue, property and equipment from expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, acts of terrorism and other political risks;\n\u2022increases in taxes and governmental royalties;\n\u2022laws and regulations affecting our operations, including with respect to customs, assessments and procedures, and similar laws and regulations that may affect our ability to move our assets in and out of foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022renegotiation or abrogation of contracts with governmental and quasi-governmental entities;\n\u2022changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies;\n\u2022currency exchange restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022global economic cycles;\n\u2022restrictions or quotas on production and commodity sales;\n\u2022limited market access; and\n\u2022other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations.\nCertain countries have in place or are in the process of developing complex laws for foreign companies doing business in these countries, such as local content requirements. Some of these laws are difficult to interpret, making compliance uncertain, and others increase the cost of doing business, which may make it difficult for us in some cases to be competitive. In addition, laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade, taxation and other commercial activity may adversely affect our international operations.\nFinancial and Liquidity Risks\nOur indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $349.6 million of consolidated indebtedness outstanding. The level of indebtedness may have an adverse effect on our future operations, including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to refinance maturing debt or to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to a continued general economic downturn, competition and industry conditions, which could place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022increasing our exposure to potential rising interest rates for the portion of our borrowings at variable interest rates;\n\u2022reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate requirements because we will be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to service debt obligations;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022limiting our ability to expand our business through capital expenditures or pursuit of acquisition opportunities due to negative covenants in credit facilities that place limitations on the types and amounts of investments that we may make;\n\u2022limiting our ability to use, or post security for, bonds or similar instruments required under the laws of certain jurisdictions with respect to, among other things, the temporary importation of vessels and equipment and the decommissioning of offshore oil and gas properties; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to use proceeds from asset sales for purposes other than debt repayment (except in certain circumstances where proceeds may be reinvested under criteria set forth in our credit agreements).\nA prolonged period of weak economic or industry conditions and other events beyond our control may make it increasingly difficult to comply with our covenants and other restrictions in agreements governing our debt. If we fail to comply with these covenants and other restrictions, it could lead to reduced liquidity, an event of default, the possible acceleration of our repayment of outstanding debt and the exercise of certain remedies by our lenders, including foreclosure against our collateral. These conditions and events may limit our access to the credit markets if we need to replace our existing debt, which could lead to increased costs and less favorable terms, including shorter repayment schedules and higher fees and interest rates.\nBecause we have certain debt and other obligations, a prolonged period of low demand and rates for our services could lead to a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nA prolonged period of difficult industry conditions, the failure of our customers to expend funds on our services or a longer period of lower rates for our services, coupled with certain fixed obligations that we have related to debt repayment, long-term vessel time charter contracts and certain other commitments related to ongoing operational activities, could lead to a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.\nLack of access to the financial markets could negatively impact our ability to operate our business.\nAccess to financing may be limited and uncertain, especially in times of economic weakness, or declining sentiment towards industries we service. If capital and credit markets are limited, we may be unable to refinance or we may incur increased costs and obtain less favorable terms associated with refinancing of our maturing debt. Also, we may incur increased costs and obtain less favorable terms associated with any additional financing that we may require for future operations. Limited access to the financial markets could adversely impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or react to changing economic and business conditions. Additionally, if capital and credit markets are limited, this could potentially result in our customers curtailing their capital and operating expenditure programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our assets and a reduction in revenues and/or utilization. Certain of our customers could experience an inability to pay suppliers, including us, in the event they are unable to access financial markets as needed to fund their operations. Likewise, our other counterparties may be unable to sustain their current level of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations, each of which could adversely affect our operations. Continued lower levels of economic activity and weakness in the financial markets could also adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic objectives.\nA further decline in the offshore energy services market could result in additional impairment charges.\nProlonged periods of low utilization and low rates for our services could result in the recognition of impairment charges for our assets if future cash flow estimates, based on information available to us at the time, indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\nOur international operations are exposed to currency devaluation and fluctuation risk.\nBecause we are a global company, our international operations are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks on all contracts denominated in foreign currencies. For some of our international contracts, a portion of the revenue and local expenses is incurred in local currencies and we are at risk of changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and such currencies. In some instances, we may receive payments in currencies that are not easily traded and may be illiquid. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in other countries\u2019 currencies. Those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nGovernment regulations may affect our business operations, including impeding our operations and making our operations more difficult and/or costly.\nOur business is affected by changes in public policy and by federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the offshore oil and gas operations. Offshore oil and gas operations are affected by tax, environmental, safety, labor, cabotage and other laws, by changes in those laws, application or interpretation of existing laws, and changes in related administrative regulations or enforcement priorities. It is also possible that these laws and regulations in the future may add significantly to our capital and operating costs or those of our customers or otherwise directly or indirectly affect our operations.\nIn January 2021, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued Order No. 3395, \u201cTemporary Suspension of Delegated Authority\u201d (\u201cOrder No. 3395\u201d). Order No. 3395 suspends for 60 days the authority of the Department of Bureaus and Offices to, among other things, issue any fossil fuel authorization including a lease, contract, or other agreement or drilling permit. Order No. 3395 does not limit existing operations under valid leases or apply to authorizations necessary to avoid conditions that may threaten human health or safety or avoid adverse impact to public land or mineral resources. The interpretation or enforcement of Order No. 3395 or similar regulation may directly impede our operations or ability to service our customers\u2019 needs. Such regulations could also result in offshore drilling rigs being diverted to well intervention work, which may create more competition for the services we offer. Such regulations may also affect oil and gas prices, which could impact the demand for our services. Such impediments, competition or reduction in activity could have a material adverse effect on our operations, competitive position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 20, 2019 CBP finalized a new set of rulings (the \u201c2019 CBP Rulings\u201d) that (i) restrict the scope of items that may be transported aboard non-coastwise qualified vessels on the OCS and (ii) establish rules regarding incidental vessel movements related to offshore lifting operations. The 2019 CBP Rulings constitute a significant step towards establishing a predictable regime of regulation for offshore operations. We are aware, however, that certain organizations are seeking to overturn the 2019 CBP Rulings, particularly with respect to offshore lifting operations. CBP, its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the federal courts or the U.S. Congress could revisit the issue and, if a challenge to the 2019 CBP Rulings were successful along the lines sought by those organizations, the resulting interpretation of the Jones Act could adversely impact the operations of non-coastwise qualified vessels working in the Gulf of Mexico, and could potentially make it more difficult and/or costly to perform our offshore services in the area.\nOn January 1, 2021, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021 came into force which, among other things, extended federal law, including the Jones Act, to U.S. offshore wind farm projects. This law could potentially make it more difficult and/or costly to provide for U.S. renewables customers the services that we currently provide for renewables customers in the North Sea.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations are issued or applied. In 2017 the U.S. enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may ultimately adversely affect us. Certain members of the EU are undergoing significant changes to their tax systems, which may have an adverse effect on us. In addition, risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in our operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Permits are required for the operations of various facilities, including vessels, and those permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations are subject to fines, injunctions or both. In some cases, those governmental requirements can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. It is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations, would result in substantial costs and liabilities. Our insurance policies and the contractual indemnity protections we seek to obtain from our counterparties, assuming they are obtained, may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risk involving compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nEnhanced regulations for deepwater offshore drilling may reduce the need for our services.\nExploration and development activities and the production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulations. To conduct deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, an operator is required to comply with existing and newly developed regulations and enhanced safety standards. Before drilling may commence, BSEE conducts many inspections of deepwater drilling operations for compliance with its regulations. Operators also are required to comply with Safety and Environmental Management System (\u201cSEMS\u201d) regulations within the deadlines specified by the regulations, and confirm that their contractors have SEMS-compliant safety and environmental policies and procedures in place. Additionally, each operator must demonstrate that it has containment resources that are available promptly in the event of a loss of well control. It is expected that government authorities, including BOEM and BSEE, will continue to issue further regulations regarding deepwater offshore drilling. Our business, a significant portion of which is in the Gulf of Mexico, provides development services to newly drilled wells, and therefore relies heavily on the industry\u2019s drilling of new oil and gas wells. If the issuance of drilling or other permits is significantly delayed, or if other oil and gas operations are delayed or reduced due to increased costs of complying with regulations, demand for our services may also decline. Moreover, if our assets are not redeployed such that we can provide our services at profitable rates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty the substance or effect of any new or additional regulations in the U.S. or in other areas around the world. If the U.S. or other countries where our customers operate enact stricter restrictions on offshore drilling or further regulate offshore drilling, and this results in decreased demand for or profitability of our services, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery laws could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 and Brazil\u2019s Clean Company Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree. We have a robust ethics and compliance program that is designed to deter or detect violations of applicable laws and regulations through the application of our anti-corruption policies and procedures, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, training, internal controls, investigation and remediation activities, and other measures. However, our ethics and compliance program may not be fully effective in preventing all employees, contractors or intermediaries from violating or circumventing our compliance requirements or applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with anti-bribery laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, and such failure, and in some instances even the mere allegation of such a failure, could create termination or other rights in connection with our existing contracts, negatively impact our ability to obtain future work, or lead to other sanctions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and cause reputational damage. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in certain jurisdictions and the seizure of vessels or other assets. Further, we may have competitors who are not subject to the same laws, which may provide them with a competitive advantage over us in securing business or gaining other preferential treatment.\nGeneral Risks\nThe loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur industry has lost a significant number of experienced professionals over the years due to its cyclical nature. Many companies, including us, have had employee layoffs as a result of reduced business activities in an industry downturn. Our success depends on the active participation of our key employees. The loss of our key people could adversely affect our operations. The delivery of our services also requires personnel with specialized skills, qualifications and experience. As a result, our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled, qualified and experienced workers, and we may have competition for personnel with the requisite skill set.\nCybersecurity breaches or business system disruptions may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to operate and record almost every aspect of our business. Similar to other companies, we may be subject to cybersecurity breaches caused by, among other things, illegal hacking, insider threats, computer viruses, phishing, malware, ransomware, or acts of vandalism or terrorism. Furthermore, we may also experience increased cybersecurity risk as our onshore personnel continue to work remotely in an effort to limit the impact of COVID-19 at our locations. Although we continue to refine our procedures, educate our employees and implement tools and security measures to protect against such cybersecurity risks, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or detect every type of attempt or attack. In addition, a cyberattack or security breach could go undetected for an extended period of time. A breach or failure of our information technology systems or networks, critical third-party systems on which we rely, or those of our customers or vendors, could result in an interruption in our operations, disruption to certain systems that are used to operate our vessels or ROVs, unplanned capital expenditures, unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, unauthorized release of customer or employee data, theft or misappropriation of funds, violation of privacy or other laws, and exposure to litigation. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain provisions of our corporate documents, financial arrangements and Minnesota law may discourage a third party from making a takeover proposal.\nWe are authorized to establish, without any action by our shareholders, the rights and preferences on up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, including dividend, liquidation and voting rights. In addition, our by-laws divide our Board into three classes. We are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. We have employment arrangements with all of our executive officers that could require cash payments, terms in certain of our convertible senior notes that could increase the applicable conversion rate and covenants in our Credit Facility that could put in breach, in the event of a \u201cchange of control.\u201d Any or all of these provisions or factors may discourage a takeover proposal or tender offer not approved by management and our Board and could result in shareholders who may wish to participate in such a proposal or tender offer receiving less in return for their shares than otherwise might be available in the event of a takeover attempt.", "PERMNO": 85168, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "HLX"}
