{"cik": "1487906", "company": "CACHET FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our business and any investment you have or may make in our Company. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also affect our business.\nOur operations and business are subject to the risks of an early stage company and we may not become profitable.\nOur business will be subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a new enterprise and the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant operating history. We cannot project whether or when we will become profitable because of the significant uncertainties regarding our ability to generate revenues. One of the principal challenges that we face is gaining customer acceptance. We face substantial competition from well-established companies with far greater resources, and our potential customers may be more familiar with our competitors and their capabilities.\nOur future success will depend upon many factors and variables facing a new business, including factors which may be beyond our control or which cannot be predicted at this time. We have formulated our business plans and strategies based on certain assumptions regarding the acceptance of our business model and the marketing of our products and services. Nevertheless, our assessments regarding market size, market share, or market acceptance of our products and services or a variety of other factors may prove incorrect. We are a new enterprise and have not previously engaged in the market in which our products and services will be offered. Although certain members of our management have consulted with an existing company offering our products and services, none of them has managed or operated a business in this field prior to joining us. In sum, we may be unable to successfully implement our business plan and become a profitable business. Any such failure will have a materially adverse effect on our prospects and, likely, the value of any investment you may make in our Company.\nWe will require additional financing to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to continue operations.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficit of $6.8 million. The independent auditor\u2019s report for the year ended December 31, 2015, includes an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion stating that our recurring losses from operations and working capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have an operating cash flow deficit of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an operating cash flow deficit of $10.1 million in fiscal year 2014, an operating cash flow deficit of $6.4 million in fiscal 2013 and an operating cash flow deficit of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. We do not currently have sufficient financial resources to fund our operations or those of our subsidiary. Therefore, we need additional funds to continue these operations. We cannot provide assurance that the proceeds from the sale of equity securities, the exercise of warrants and conversion of debt will be sufficient to sustain the operations of the Company on a long-term basis or through the end of the year.\nWe may direct Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC to purchase up to $10,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock under a Purchase Agreement dated October 12, 2015 over a 36-month period generally in amounts up to 50,000 shares of our common stock on any such business day (a \u201cRegular Purchase\u201d), provided that at least one business day has passed since the most recent Regular Purchase, increasing to up to 200,000 shares, depending upon the closing sale price of the common stock. We may also direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $100,000 worth of shares of common stock on any business day (an \u201cAdditional Purchase\u201d), provided that at least six business days have passed since the most recent Additional Purchase was completed. As of April 12, 2016, we had utilized $272,755 of the $10,000,000 limit. However, Lincoln Park may not make further purchases of common stock under the Purchase Agreement if such purchases would result in it beneficially owning greater than 9.99% of our shares outstanding or if we are not in compliance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement. Further, in the future, maximum proceeds to the Company under the Purchase Agreement will be impacted by, among other things, the following factors: (i) the prevailing market price of our common stock at the time various purchases are made under the Purchase Agreement; (ii) whether or not our shares outstanding increases through, for example, the issuance of additional shares of our common stock outside the Purchase Agreement; and (iii) increases or decreases in Lincoln Park\u2019s holdings of our common stock during the term of the Purchase Agreement. If we elect to issue and sell more than the 7,600,000 purchase shares under our agreement with Lincoln Park, which we have the right, but not the obligation, to do, we must first register for resale under the Securities Act any such additional shares, which could cause additional substantial dilution to our stockholders. The number of shares ultimately offered for resale by Lincoln Park is dependent upon the number of shares we sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.\nThe extent we rely on Lincoln Park as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including, the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from Lincoln Park were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs. Even if we sell all $10,000,000 under the Purchase Agreement to Lincoln Park, we may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe will need additional financing in the future and any such financing may dilute our existing stockholders.\nWe require additional financing to continue our operations. Additional financing could be sought from a number of sources, including but not limited to additional sales of equity or debt securities (including equity-linked or convertible debt securities), loans from banks, loans from affiliates of the Company or other financial institutions. We may not, however, be able to sell any securities or obtain any such additional financing when needed, or do so on terms and conditions acceptable or favorable to us, if at all. If financing is not available, we may be forced to abandon our business plans or our entire business, or discontinue our preparation and filing of public disclosure reports with the SEC. If, on the other hand, we do successfully enter into a financing transaction, then any additional equity or equity-linked financing would be dilutive to our stockholders, and additional debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.\nOur registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn its report dated April 14, 2016, our independent registered public accounting firm, Lurie, LLP, stated that our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern and noted that our limited revenues, recurring losses from operations and stockholder deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We continue to experience limited revenues, operating losses and a stockholder deficit. Because we have received an opinion from our auditor that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as a going concern, it may be more difficult for us to attract investors, secure debt financing or bank loans, or a combination of the foregoing, on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue, find financing, or adjust our operating expenses so as to maintain positive working capital, then we likely will be forced to cease operations and investors will likely lose their entire investment. We can give no assurance as to our ability to generate adequate revenue, raise sufficient capital, sufficiently reduce operating expenses, or continue as a going concern. In addition, concerns about our financial viability may have an adverse effect on current and potential customers\u2019 willingness to enter into long-term relationships with us.\nWe have a significant number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock, the exercise of options and warrants and certain outstanding debt obligation, the issuance of such shares upon conversion and/or exercise will have a dilutive impact on our stockholders.\nThere are 14.4 million shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock as of April 12, 2016. We also have outstanding as of such date stock options and warrants to purchase a total of 34.2 million shares of common stock. The issuance of such shares will have a dilutive impact on our stockholders.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nShares of our common stock that we have issued directly or that have been or may be acquired upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities are or may be covered by registration statements which permit the public sale of stock. Other holders of shares of common stock that we have issued including shares issuable upon exchange or conversion as described above may be entitled to dispose of their shares pursuant to (i) the applicable holding period, volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 or (ii) another exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. Additional sales of a substantial number of our shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe have a significant amount of secured and unsecured debt, which could limit or eliminate recovery of your investment if we fail to reach profitability.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2016, our total indebtedness aggregated to $5.3 million, of which $3.6 million was senior secured indebtedness owed to three lenders, and $1.7 million was unsecured indebtedness. In addition, the amount of accrued but unpaid interest as of March 31, 2016 totaled approximately $0.7 million. The holder of our series subordinated note referred to in note 6 of our consolidated financial statements has commenced an action against us to collect alleged amounts due and owing under the note. The holder of the note alleges we are in default. We dispute the allegations of the note holder and intend to vigorously defend the claim. However, the alleged default could subject the Company to claims of default or cross default by our other lenders. At this time no other lender has asserted such a claim. For more information, please see the risk factor immediately above (\u201cWe have a significant number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion. . . . \u201d) and Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements. We may be unable to satisfy the entirety of our debt owed to our lenders. Any such failure could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, business prospects, and our viability.\nIf we are unable to pay or refinance our senior secured indebtedness when due, or if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, these junior creditors may not recover the value of their notes. As a matter of state and creditor law, common stock and preferred stock rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, both secured and unsecured, and to other non-equity claims against our assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings. Due to the substantial indebtedness of our Company, holders of our common stock and preferred stock face the risk that they may not recover any portion of their investment unless all of the claims of our creditors are satisfied first or unless they are able to sell their stock prior to any such claims are asserted.\nOur success critically depends on the continued popularity of our product and service technologies in general, and our products and services solution in particular, achieving and maintaining widespread acceptance in our targeted markets. If our products and services fall out of favor, or if our products and services fails to win consumer acceptance, the viability of our business may be threatened.\nWe expect that our success will depend to a large extent on the continuing broad market acceptance of our product and services technologies in general, and on market acceptance of our products and services among banks and credit unions. Our target customers may not currently use our products and services solutions for a number of other reasons, including unfamiliarity with the technology or perceived lack of reliability. We believe that the acceptance of our products and services by our prospective customers will depend on the following factors:\n\u25cf the continued importance of our product technologies and capabilities among end-user consumers;\n\u25cf our ability to demonstrate our products and services economic and other benefits;\n\u25cf our customers\u2019 acceptance of us as a service provider; and\n\u25cf the reliability of the software and hardware comprising our products and services solution.\nEven if we are successful in refining, selling and servicing our products and related solutions, the market may slow or not grow fast enough for us to attain profitability in the near future, if ever.\nUnder our current business model, we rely upon third parties to provide software integration, hardware, fulfillment and support and maintenance services in connection with our products and services.\nWe do not own outright all of the rights and technologies, including software, that is used in our products. We may develop proprietary software for our solutions by using imaging, mobile solutions or other technologies from various partners. For instance, our product platform utilizes software and hardware from multiple third-party vendors such as Mitek Systems Inc., Parascript, LLC, AQ2 Technologies, LLC and Nitro Mobile Solutions, LLC, and we expect that we will continue to rely on multiple third-party vendors to create competitive software offerings for our customers and to provide them with state-of-the-art products.\nWe also rely on cooperation among our third-party vendors, and if they are unwilling to work with us or one another to perform needed integration services, our ability to provide competitive software offerings may be adversely impacted. The performance of our products and solutions depends upon the performance and quality of third party products and services, including hardware fulfillment, support and maintenance. If the systems provided by third parties develop technical or operations problems, or cannot be scaled to meet the needs of our customers, or the third parties do not perform required services in a timely manner, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Any such outcome could adversely affect the value or price of our common stock.\nIf our products have product defects or we fail to provide agreed upon services to our clients and end users, it could materially damage our reputation, sales and profitability and result in other costs.\nThe products we provide to our clients and industry partners, including those licensed from third parties and those we develop, are extremely complex and are constantly being modified and improved, and as such, they may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as new versions are released. As a result, we could in the future face loss or delay in recognition of revenues as a result of software errors or defects. Our contracts with users and partners contain provisions that may require us to remedy malfunctions in our products or the services we provide and to pay damages if we breach our contractual obligations.\nDespite our reliance on established software vendors and our testing, errors may still be found in our products, resulting in loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation, adverse litigation, or service and warranty costs, any of which would have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition. Ultimately, any of these outcomes could adversely affect the value or price of our common stock.\nWe face risks related to the storage of our customers\u2019 and their end users\u2019 confidential and proprietary information.\nOur products are designed to maintain the confidentiality and security of our customers\u2019 and their end users\u2019 confidential and proprietary information that is stored on our systems, which may include sensitive financial data. However, any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to this data could expose us to liability for the loss of such information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are difficult to recognize and react to. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative or reactionary measures.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change. If we are unable to adapt our products and develop or acquire new technology to keep with these rapid changes, we will not be able to obtain or maintain market share.\nThe market for our product is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs and heavy competition. Furthermore, many of our competitors have greater capabilities and resources to develop and test new technology more rapidly than we do. We must respond to changing technology and industry standards in a timely and cost-effective manner. We may not be successful in acquiring new technologies, developing or acquiring new products or enhancing existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner. These new technologies or enhancements may not achieve market acceptance. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on financially favorable terms or at all. Finally, we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.\nOur image in the marketplace could be damaged if our products and services become unavailable due to human error, power or Internet connectivity issues, or if there are security breaches.\nIt is important that our product and service solutions servers are available for processing to our customers on a 24/7/365 basis. We rely on our ISP to provide consistent service and administration, keep up with technical requirements and innovations, and maintain industry standards of redundancy and recovery. If our ISP does not meet these requirements, our image may suffer in the marketplace and we could lose customers.\nOur business may be adversely affected by malicious applications that interfere with, or exploit security flaws in, our products and services. The financial services industry, and in particular banks and those involved in the check-cashing segment, are concerned about the maintenance of customer privacy and compliance with consumer privacy requirements under laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure on our part to comply, and even the failure of a competitor of ours in our industry, may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are Internet based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security, or lapses by competitors in our industry, that results in the release of users\u2019 data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of Internet-based products and services we offer.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure. Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users\u2019 and customers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.\nThe failure to grow our revenues could adversely affect our ability remain a public reporting company.\nWe intend to grow our revenues organically, which we expect will require a substantial amount of time, money, and other valuable resources. As we sign contracts with financial institutions, a portion of the revenue we generate is based on the customer acceptance and usage. Therefore, there is no assurance we will be successful in generating transactional revenue from our customers. Also, if we are unable to grow our revenues quickly enough to pay for our infrastructure and administrative costs, the continued added costs associated with being a public company (e.g., additional legal, accounting and professional consulting costs) may outweigh the benefits of being a public reporting company, and we may ultimately determine or be forced to cease filing our periodic reports with the SEC and de-register as a public company.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny new and significant sustained growth will likely place a strain on our management systems and operational resources. Our ability to compete effectively and to manage our future growth, if any, will depend on our ability to maintain and improve operational, financial, and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand, train, motivate and manage our work force. If we begin to grow significantly, we cannot be certain that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations.\nWe may be required to expend significant resources to comply with governmental regulations.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations. New laws or new interpretations of existing laws will also impact our business. Such laws may include the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Generally, the Dodd-Frank Act is effective the day after it was signed into law, but different effective dates apply to specific provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, which could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a whole, or on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we provide material services to insured depository institutions, we may be subject to certain provisions of the Bank Service Company Act as well as provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB prohibits service providers from engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, as defined by the CFPB, and requires them to conform services to the provisions of federal consumer financial laws, as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, and prohibits them from committing any act or omission in violation of a federal consumer financial law. The Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with enforcement powers that include the authority to conduct investigations and adjudication proceedings, and litigation authority, and which authorize the CFPB to, among other things, assess civil money penalties as provided in the Dodd-Frank Act. At this time, we do not expect that as a service provider the activities of the Bureau will have a material adverse impact on our Company and that we will be able to comply with the regulations of the Bureau as and when they are issued.\nIn addition, whether or not U.S. laws and regulations that apply to banks and other service providers apply to us, our clients have and may in the future require us to adhere to standards relating to high levels of security, the maintenance of customer privacy and other regulatory areas that they are obligated meet in their compliance with such laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet such requirements. Any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business and its viability, as well as the price of our common stock.\nChanges in banking regulations could negatively affect our business.\nOur financial institution clients are subject to the supervision of several federal, state and local government regulatory agencies, and we must continually ensure that our products and services work within the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our financial institution clients. Regulation of financial institutions such as banks can indirectly affect our business. While the use of our products by financial institutions is either not subject to, or is currently in compliance with, banking regulations, a change in regulations or the creation of new regulations on financial institutions, including modifying a financial institution\u2019s ability to offer products and services similar to ours, could prevent or lessen the use of our products and services by financial institutions, which would have a substantial negative effect on our business and operations.\nOur success may depend on retaining key personnel and our ability to attract and retain additional personnel.\nOur key personnel currently include:\n\u25cf Jeffrey C. Mack, Chief Executive Officer and President\n\u25cf Bruce Whitmore, Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer\n\u25cf Lawrence C. Blaney, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\n\u25cf Bryan Meier, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel or to attract, retain and motivate additional qualified associates, our ability to maintain and develop our business may be adversely affected. Our future success depends significantly on the continued service of our key technical, sales and senior management personnel and their ability to execute our growth strategy. The loss of the services of our key associates could harm our business, including our loss of these individuals due to death or disability. In this regard, we do not have any key-person insurance on any of the above-identified individuals. We have written employment agreements with all but one of the above-identified individuals, and all of those agreements contain customary non-competition and other restrictive covenants benefitting the Company, but these agreements do not guarantee the services of these individuals for the terms of their agreements or beyond.\nIn sum, we may be unable to retain our employees (including for reasons beyond our control) or to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees who could migrate to other employers offering superior compensation packages. If we are unable to hire and retain enough qualified technical, sales and marketing personnel, and management personnel, or if those we hire are not as productive as we expect, we may not be able to achieve our sales plans or maintain our current level of sales. In any such event, our price of our common stock may decline due to failures to meet expectations, need for additional financing to meet our goals, or both.\nOur ability to execute our business strategy may depend on our ability to protect our current intellectual property or intellectual property we may develop in the future, and if any third parties make unauthorized use of our intellectual property, or if our intellectual property rights are successfully challenged, our competitive position and business could suffer.\nOur success and ability to compete will depend substantially on our ability to develop proprietary technologies. We own no patents, but have filed several applications with the U.S. Patent Office. These include an application filed in October 2010, relating to our Apple OS X Internet deposit application. We cannot be certain that our intellectual-property rights will not be infringed upon, that others will not develop products in violation of our intellectual-property rights, or that others may assert, rightly or wrongly, that our intellectual-property rights are invalid or unenforceable. In instances where we may rely on trade secrets for the protection of our confidential and proprietary business information, we cannot be certain that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become discovered or, for that matter, independently developed by our competitors. In general, defending intellectual-property rights is expensive and consumes considerable time and attention of management. Our involvement in intellectual-property litigation would likely have a materially and adverse effect on our business and may threaten our viability. Even if we were ultimately successful in defending our intellectual-property rights, the cost of such defense may be crippling to our business and materially and adversely affect our prospects and viability.\nIn addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. There can be no assurance that we will obtain patents on the inventions disclosed in our provisional application or on any future patent applications, nor can there be any assurance that the scope of any future patent will be sufficiently broad to offer us meaningful protection. Finally, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share.\nCompanies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property or proprietary rights, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products.\nOther persons may bring claims against us alleging that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights or claims that our intellectual property rights are not valid. Any claims against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend or litigate, divert our attention and resources, result in the loss of goodwill associated with our business or require us to make changes to our products and services. In addition, we may need to bring legal claims to enforce or protect such intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, may result in substantial costs and a diversion of our resources.\nAn entity named Cachet Banq contacted us in December 2010 relative to their U.S. Trademark Registration No. 2,857,465 (registered on June 29, 2004) for the standard character mark CACHET covering \u201cfinancial services, namely automated clearing house processing services for the payroll service industry.\u201d Cachet Banq has alleged that our use of \u201cCACHET\u201d infringes on their federal trademark registration. On March 4, 2013, Cachet Banq filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment. The initial brief was filed on May 30, 2014, replies were filed on June 26, 2014 and the court took these motions under advisement on July 8, 2014. We have denied that our use of the character mark CACHET infringes on Cachet Banq\u2019s purported rights in their mark, and we will vigorously defend this and any future claims made by Cachet Banq. On September 21, 2015, the Court issued an Order (1) granting Cachet Banq\u2019s motion for summary judgment, (2) denying our motion for summary judgment, and (3) ordering the parties to submit memoranda regarding remedies. The last of those memoranda were submitted on October 12, 2015. Cachet Banq is not seeking any monetary damages as a result of the alleged infringement. Cachet Banq seeks an injunction and their attorney\u2019s fees. The parties are currently awaiting the Court\u2019s decision on remedies. In any event, the Company believes that the Court\u2019s order granting Cachet Banq\u2019s motion for summary judgment was in error, and plans to appeal its decision.\nAny litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, may result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.\nWe compete with other companies that are well established and have more resources, and we may also compete against technologies developed in-house by some of our clients or potential clients, all of which puts us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe market for remote deposit capture is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase. Most of our competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They are also able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. On occasion, we may also have potential clients who have developed their RDC products and services internally, and so our competition may come from within the clients themselves, sometimes making it more difficult to consummate a transaction due to territoriality, bias toward in-house developed capabilities, or concerns about our support availability in comparison to in-house support.\nWe expect competitors to continue to improve the performance of their products and to introduce new products, services and technologies. Successful new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could affect our sales and the market acceptance of our products, cause intense price competition or make our products obsolete. To be competitive, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. If we do not have sufficient resources to make these investments, or are unable to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive, our competitive position will suffer. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business.\nFinancial institutions are subject to industry consolidation, and we may lose clients with little notice, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nThe financial institution industry is prone to consolidations that result from mergers and acquisitions. Other financial institutions that do not use our products and services may acquire our existing clients and then convert them to competing products and services. Most of our contracts provide for a charge to the client for early termination of the contract without cause, but these charges are insufficient to replace the recurring revenues that we would have received if the financial institution had continued as a client.\nRisks from our international operations could impair our ability to expand in certain international markets and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe plan to continue to grow both domestically and internationally. Foreign operations carry special risks including:\n\u25cf exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf government controls;\n\u25cf import and export license requirements;\n\u25cf political or economic instability;\n\u25cf trade restrictions;\n\u25cf changes in tariffs and taxes;\n\u25cf differences in local laws, regulations, practices, and business customs;\n\u25cf restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States or movement of funds to other countries;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n\u25cf increases and volatility in labor costs.\nAny of the foregoing or other factors associated with doing business abroad could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks arising from acquisitions.\nWe have made an acquisition in the past and may pursue similar strategic transactions in the future. Risks in acquisition transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations and control environment, difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing customers of the acquired entities, assumed or unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, the failure of counterparties to satisfy any obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses, and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth expectations for the acquired businesses. Fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions and other strategic transactions. These risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from acquisitions and could result in the failure to realize the full economic value of a strategic transaction or the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of an acquisition. These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, then our business and operating results could be harmed.\nInternal controls over financial reporting are processes designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, cause our financial statements to contain material misstatements, and harm our business and operating results. Even if we do not experience material weaknesses, our internal controls may not prevent all potential errors, because any control system, regardless of its design, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. In 2015, the Company engaged with an outside consulting firm to assist us in completing management\u2019s self-assessment of our internal controls. As a result of this review, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by our Annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nIn the foreseeable future, we do not expect to declare or pay any cash or other dividends on our common stock. In part, this is because our current debt agreements restrict us from paying dividends. Moreover, any future borrowing arrangements may similarly prevent us from paying dividends on our common stock during such time as we are subject to those terms. Regardless, we anticipate that we would re-invest any earnings into the business for purposes of growth. This means that the sole means of our stockholders making a profit on a purchase of our common stock must occur through appreciation in the price of our common stock on the market. As indicated elsewhere, our Company, business and industry, and an investment in our common stock is subject to numerous risks. Stockholders may be unable to sell their stock at times and at prices that they believe are reflective of the true value of their shares, if at all.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our corporate bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us. For example, Delaware law contains a business combination statute. The anti-takeover effect of the business combination statue could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws make the acquisition of our Company more difficult, including the following:\n\u25cf only a majority of our directors are authorized to call a special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors; and\n\u25cf our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, by our Board of Directors without any stockholder approval.\nBecause these provisions and laws could discourage takeover attempts, even when a change of control would be beneficial to a stockholder, these provisions and laws could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nBeing a public company results in additional expenses and diverts management\u2019s attention, and could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified directors.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements generate significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs, and make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly, and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have an adverse and even material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. If we are unable to obtain appropriate director and officer insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors, especially those directors who may be deemed independent, could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, investors should understand that certain of our historical financial statements contained in this prospectus do not include or reflect the costs or strains of being a public reporting company. As a consequence, an investor should understand that our general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of our becoming a public reporting company.\nThe protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward-looking statements does not apply to us. The lack of this protection could harm us in the event of an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding relating to forward-looking statements made by us.\nAlthough federal securities laws provide a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws, this safe harbor is not available to certain issuers, including penny stock issuers. We believe we are not currently eligible for the statutory safe harbor included in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, we will not have the benefit of this statutory safe harbor protection in the event of certain legal actions based upon forward-looking statements. The lack of this protection in a contested proceeding could harm our financial condition and, ultimately, the value of our common stock.\nOur officers and directors possess controlling voting power with respect to our common stock, which will limit your influence on corporate matters.\nOur officers and directors collectively possess beneficial ownership of approximately 43.8% of our voting stock as of April 12, 2016. As a result, our insiders have the ability to out rightly control our management and affairs through the election and removal of our Board of Directors and all other matters requiring stockholder approval, including the future merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change-of-control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. Furthermore, this concentrated control will limit the practical effect of your participation in Company matters, through stockholder votes and otherwise. Any of these effects could depress the price or value of our common stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation grants our Board of Directors the power to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to designate other classes of preferred stock, all without stockholder approval.\nOur authorized capital consists of 520 million shares of capital stock of which 20 million shares are designated as preferred stock. Our Board of Directors, without any action by our stockholders, may designate and issue shares of preferred stock in such series as it deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights, provided it is consistent with Delaware law.\nThe rights of holders of our preferred stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of holders of our common shares. The designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant to shares of our common stock. Furthermore, any issuances of additional stock (common or preferred) will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of then-current holders of our capital stock and may dilute our book value per share.\nBecause we became public by means of a reverse merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.\nAdditional risks to our investors may exist since we became public through a \u201creverse merger.\u201d Security analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our Company since, because we became public through a reverse merger, there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. In addition, because of past abuses and fraud concerns stemming primarily from a lack of public information about newly public businesses, there are many people in the securities industry and business in general who view reverse merger transactions with suspicion. Without brokerage firm and analyst coverage, there may be fewer people aware of us and our business, resulting in fewer potential buyers of our securities, less liquidity, and lower stock prices for our investors than would be the case if we had become a public reporting company in a more traditional manner.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors, variations in our operating results and market conditions specific to our business. Furthermore, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. As such, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the price of our common stock and materially affect the value of your investment.\nOur common stock presently is listed for trading on the OTCQB.\nOur common stock presently is listed for trading on the OTC Market\u2019s OTCQB service.\nA listing on the OTC Markets is generally understood to be a less active, and therefore less liquid, trading market than other types of markets such as a stock exchange. Compared to a listing on a stock exchange, a listing on the OTC Markets can be expected to have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts\u2019 and the media\u2019s coverage of us and our common stock. This may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock. In addition, we have had small trading volume in our common stock, which makes it difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares as and when they choose. Small trading volumes generally depress market prices. An active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained. As a result, we believe that you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock publicly, if at all, at times and prices that you feel are fair or appropriate.\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which may make it difficult to sell shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock is categorized as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under this rule, broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must, among other things, provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by the SEC. Under applicable regulations, our common stock will generally remain a \u201cpenny stock\u201d until and for such time as its per-share price is $5.00 or more (as determined in accordance with SEC regulations), or until we meet certain net asset or revenue thresholds. These thresholds include the possession of net tangible assets (i.e., total assets less intangible assets and liabilities) in excess of $2 million if we have been operating for at least three years or $5 million if we have been operating for fewer than three years, and the recognition of average revenues equal to at least $6 million for each of the last three years.\nThe penny-stock rules severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market, and many brokers choose not to participate in penny-stock transactions. As a result, there is generally less trading in penny stocks. If you become a holder of our common stock, you may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock in a public broker\u2019s transaction, if at all, at the times and prices that you feel are fair or appropriate.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of some other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of exemptions from certain reporting requirements available to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d under that Act, including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (relating to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and any proxy statements we may be required to file, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would apply to private companies.\nWe have elected to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d Consequently, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d In this regard, we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years after the first sale of our common equity securities under an effective registration statement. However, we may cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d earlier under certain circumstances, including (i) if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 in which case we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of December 31 of such year, (ii) if our gross revenue exceeds $1.0 billion in any fiscal year or (iii) if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive due to our reliance on these exemptions. If investors were to find our securities less attractive as a result of our election, our stock price may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 16629, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "DGLT"}
