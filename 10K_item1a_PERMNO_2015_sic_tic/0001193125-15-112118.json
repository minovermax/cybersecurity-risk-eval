RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our Common Stock or any other security that may be issued by us involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our shares of Common Stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this Report.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred recurring net losses, including net losses of approximately $14.7 million and $24.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $84.9 million. We have generated limited revenue and have funded our operations to date primarily from private sales of equity and debt securities. We expect to incur substantial additional losses over the next several years primarily related to our research and development activities. As a result, we may never achieve or maintain profitability unless we successfully commercialize our CorPath System. If we are unable to make required payments under any of our obligations for any reason, our creditors may take actions to collect their debts, including foreclosing on our intellectual property that collateralizes our obligations. If we continue to incur substantial losses and are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to discontinue or curtail our business operations, sell assets at unfavorable prices, refinance existing debt obligations on terms unfavorable to us, or merge, consolidate, or combine with a company with greater financial resources in a transaction that might be unfavorable to us.\nCustomers may not accept the CorPath System which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share.\nThe CorPath System is a new technology that competes with established treatment options for PCI procedures. These established treatment options include manual conventional PCI methods which are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use. Studies can be published that show that our methods are more beneficial; however, we cannot be certain that physicians will use our products to replace or supplement established procedures or that our products will become accepted or competitive.\nWe operate in a competitive industry and may face competition from potential competitors that develop products, treatments or procedures that are similar, more advanced, safer or more effective than ours.\nOur potential competitors may develop products, treatments or procedures that are similar, more advanced, safer or more effective than ours. The medical device industry is very competitive and subject to significant technological and practice changes. We expect to face competition from many different sources with respect to our existing products and products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products, treatments or procedures that are safer, more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than our existing products or any product that we may develop. Many of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we may have. Mergers and acquisitions in the medical device industry market may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our potential competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may\nalso prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nUntil we reach profitability and generate operating cash flows to grow the business, we will need to continue to raise additional funding. We may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts and growth strategy.\nWe will need additional funding for establishing and expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure and for future product development and we may be unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe have funded operations primarily through the issuance of capital stock and debt. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $84.9 million. On September 16, 2014, we closed a Securities Purchase Agreement with multiple investors in a private placement in which we sold 10,666,570 shares of our Common Stock at $2.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $26.7 million with net proceeds to us of $25.5 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $28.5 million in cash. We believe that this cash on hand, will meet our operating needs for at least the period through December 31, 2015.\nAs we continue to incur losses and generate negative gross margins on product sales, the transition to positive gross margins and profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We may never achieve profitability, and unless and until doing so, intend to fund future operations through additional debt or equity offerings. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nShould we intend to raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience immediate dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any additional debt or equity financing that we close may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund expansion, successfully promote our brand name, develop or enhance our services, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, any of which could seriously harm our business and reduce the value of your investment.\nThe commercial success of our products will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by hospitals and physicians. Should we not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.\nThe CorPath System represents a fundamentally new way of performing PCI procedures. Achieving physician, patient and third-party payor acceptance of the CorPath System as a preferred method of performing vascular procedures will be crucial to our success. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, hospital customers will not purchase our products and we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business. We believe that acceptance by hospitals, physicians and third-party payors regarding the benefits of procedures performed using our products will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients. Physicians will not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to existing PCI techniques. Even though we have proven the effectiveness of our products through clinical trials, physicians may elect not to use our products for any number of other reasons. For example, cardiologists may continue to recommend conventional PCI techniques simply because it is already widely accepted. In addition, physicians may be slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks\narising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third-party payors, particularly in light of ongoing health care reform initiatives. We expect that there will be a learning process involved for physicians and their surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training. We may not be able to rapidly train physicians and their surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products.\nDevelopment and awareness of our brand will largely depend upon our success in increasing our customer base. In order to attract and retain customers and to promote and maintain our brand in response to competitive pressures, management plans to significantly increase our sales and marketing budgets, particularly for our field sales force. If we are unable to economically promote or maintain our brand, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be severely harmed.\nDecreasing cath lab patient volume could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur current target market consists of the estimated 3,250 cath lab rooms in the U.S. that perform PCI procedures, which we estimate represents 40% of the global market of more than 8,000 PCI cath lab rooms. U.S. cath lab patient volume has decreased over the past several years, leading to increased competition for patients. If U.S. cath patient volume continues to decrease, it may become more difficult for us to grow revenue and increase market share and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may experience long and variable capital sales cycles and/or seasonality in our business which may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nOur CorPath System may have a lengthy sales and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and such a purchase generally requires the approval of senior management of hospitals, their parent organizations, purchasing groups, and/or government bodies, as applicable. In addition, hospitals may delay or accelerate system purchases in conjunction with timing of their capital budget timelines. As a result, it is difficult for us to predict the length of capital sales cycles and, therefore, the exact timing of capital sales. We believe that our sales may tend to be heaviest during the third month of each fiscal quarter, and lighter in the third and first fiscal quarters and heavier in the fourth fiscal quarter. Timing of PCI procedures and changes in the PCI procedure market could directly affect the timing of the purchase of our products by hospitals.\nThe above factors may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and it is possible that in some future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease. These fluctuations, among other factors, also mean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance. In addition, the introduction of new products could adversely impact our sales cycle as customers take additional time to assess the benefits and costs of such products.\nIf defects are discovered in our products, we may incur additional unforeseen costs, hospitals may not purchase our products and our reputation may suffer.\nOur products incorporate mechanical parts, electrical components, optical components and computer software, any of which can contain errors or failures, especially when first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex medical procedures, we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects. We cannot assure that our products will not experience component aging, errors or performance problems in the future. If we experience flaws or performance problems, any of the following could occur:\n\u2022\ndelays in product shipments,\n\u2022\nloss of revenue,\n\u2022\ndelay in market acceptance,\n\u2022\ndiversion of our resources,\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation,\n\u2022\nproduct recalls,\n\u2022\nregulatory actions,\n\u2022\nincreased service or warranty costs, or\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims.\nIn the future, we may be subject to product liability and negligence claims relating to the use of our products that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nOur business exposes us to significant risks of product liability claims, which are inherent to the medical device industry. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class. We are not currently subject to any product liability claims; however, future product liability claims may result in negative publicity about us that could ultimately harm our reputation. Negative publicity, whether accurate or inaccurate, concerning us or our products, could reduce market acceptance of our products and could result in decreased product demand and a decline in revenues. Although we maintain product liability insurance, the coverage limits of these policies may not be adequate to cover any future claims.\nWe may be subject to product recalls that could negatively affect our business.\nWe may be subject to product recalls, withdrawals or seizures if any of our products are believed to cause injury or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the manufacture, labeling, promotion, sale or distribution of our products. A recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of our products could materially and adversely affect consumer confidence in our brand and lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, a recall, withdrawal or seizure of our products would require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business may be affected by unfavorable publicity or lack of consumer acceptance.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumer acceptance of the safety, efficacy and quality of our products. Consumer acceptance of a product can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, national media attention and other publicity about product use. A product may be received favorably resulting in high sales associated with that product that may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to our industry or to any of our products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. A future research report or publicity that is perceived by our consumers as less than favorable or that may question earlier favorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue. Adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, statements by regulatory authorities or otherwise, whether or not accurate, that associates the use of our product with adverse effects, or that questions the benefits of our product or a similar product, or that claims that our products are ineffective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf institutions or physicians are unable to obtain coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures using our products, or if reimbursement is insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing our products, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to support our business.\nIn the U.S., hospitals generally bill for the services performed with our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans. Currently, there is no incremental reimbursement provided for robotic-assisted PCI. Therefore, using the CorPath System and\nconsumable cassette without an incremental reimbursement will initially increase the up-front cost of the PCI procedure and the cath lab operation based on the cost of the CorPath System and also consumable cassettes. This lack of incremental reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or lack of coverage by governmental and private payors\u2019 policies of interventional procedures performed using our products, may make use unable to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.\nWe could be subject to significant, uninsured liabilities.\nIn the future, we may not continue to maintain certain existing insurance coverage or adequate levels of coverage. Premiums for many types of insurance have increased significantly in recent years, and depending on market conditions and our circumstances, in the future, certain types of insurance such as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance or products liability insurance may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may encounter manufacturing problems or delays that could result in lost revenue.\nManufacturing our products is a complex process. We may encounter difficulties in scaling up or maintaining production of our products, including:\n\u2022\nproblems involving production yields,\n\u2022\nquality control and assurance,\n\u2022\ncomponent supply shortages,\n\u2022\nimport or export restrictions on components, materials or technology,\n\u2022\nshortages of qualified personnel, and\n\u2022\ncompliance with state and federal regulations.\nIf demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders. If we are unable to maintain larger-scale manufacturing capabilities, our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged.\nChanges to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing standards or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nWe use estimates, make judgments and apply certain methods in measuring the progress of our business, in determining our financial results and in applying our accounting policies. As these estimates, judgments and methods change, our assessment of the progress of our business and our results of operations could vary.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time may lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in any of our assumptions may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nIn addition, we use methods for determining market sizes and procedures completed that involve estimates and judgments, which are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our estimates of market sizes or procedures performed do not have an impact on our results of operations but are used to estimate the progress of our business. Estimates and judgments for determining market sizes and\nprocedures may vary over time with changes in treatment modalities, hospital reporting behavior, increases in procedures and other factors. In addition, from time to time, we may change the method for determining market sizes and procedures, causing variation in our reporting.\nWe currently owe $10 million under a loan agreement and we can give no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our obligations under the loan agreement at the maturity date.\nOn June 11, 2014, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement pursuant to which the lender agreed to make an aggregate of $10 million available to us under two $5 million secured promissory notes (the \u201cSecured Promissory Notes\u201d). The initial note for $5 million was made on June 11, 2014 (the \u201cInitial Note\u201d) and the second note for $5 million was made on December 31, 2014 (the \u201cSecond Note\u201d), which became available following completion of the private placement which we closed in September 2014. The Secured Promissory Notes are repayable over a term of 27 months beginning on July 1, 2015. The Initial Note bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of (w) 11.25% or (x) 11.25% plus the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, less 3.25%. The Second Note bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of (y) 9.95% or (z) 9.95% plus the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, less 3.25%. There is no assurance that we will have the funds available to meet our principal and interest payment obligations under the Secured Promissory Notes or that we will be able to satisfy covenants or other obligations under the Secured Promissory Notes. Our covenants under the loan arrangement include certain restrictions with respect to subsequent indebtedness, liens, loans and investments, asset sales, and share repurchases and other restricted payments, subject to certain exceptions. The arrangement also includes financial reporting obligations. An event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement includes, but is not limited to, breach of covenants, insolvency, and occurrence of any default under any agreement or obligation of the Company.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations.\nA number of factors may harm our future effective tax rates including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed,\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various taxing authorities,\n\u2022\nchange in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities,\n\u2022\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,\n\u2022\nchanges in available tax credits and deductions,\n\u2022\nchanges in share-based compensation, and\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause we have incurred losses to date, we have not recorded any income tax provision thus far. At December 31, 2014, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $54.8 million and $34.2 million, respectively, that can be carried forward and offset against future taxable income. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029. Utilization of net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the \u201cchange in ownership\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state provisions. This limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. We have not yet determined whether any changes in ownership have triggered any such limitations. There can be no assurance that we will utilize the entire amount of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nDisruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business customer relations and financial condition.\nInformation technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. If our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.\nOur business requires us to use and store personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) of our customers, employees and business partners. This may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems.\nWe devote significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. We may experience a breach of our systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and may harm our business operations. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of our products and services could decrease.\nThe content of our website could expose us to significant liability.\nBecause we post product information and other content on our website, we face potential liability for, among other things, copyright infringement, patent infringement, trademark infringement, defamation, unauthorized practice of medicine, false or misleading advertising and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials we post. Although we maintain general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance, or is in excess of our insurance coverage, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to manage growth effectively could prevent us from achieving our goals.\nOur growth strategy may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources. Our ability to effectively manage growth depends on our ability to substantially expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and to attract, train, manage and retain qualified management and other personnel. Our failure to successfully manage growth could result in our sales not increasing commensurately with capital investments. Our inability to successfully manage growth could materially adversely affect our business.\nAny failure to adequately expand our direct sales force will impede our growth. If we are unable to attract, hire and retain qualified sales and management personnel, the commercial opportunity for our products may be diminished.\nWe expect to be substantially dependent on a direct sales force to attract new business and to manage customer relationships. We plan to expand our direct sales force and believe that there is significant competition for qualified, productive direct sales personnel with advanced sales skills and technical knowledge of our industry. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient direct sales personnel. Recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as expected and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. If we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive sales personnel, our business prospects could suffer.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our sales force consisted of 16 field support and clinical support personnel. We may not be able to attract, hire, train and retain qualified sales and sales management personnel. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain and grow a qualified sales force, our ability to independently market and promote our products may be impaired. Even if we are able to effectively maintain a qualified sales force, our sales force may not be successful in commercializing our products.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, or to retain our executive management team, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our products.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial personnel. We are highly dependent upon our executive management team. The loss of the services of any one or more of the members of our executive management team could delay or prevent the successful completion of some of our development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may also be employed by other companies and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for intellectual property relating to our technology and products, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our technology and products. The patent situation in the field of medical devices involves complex legal and scientific questions. We rely upon patents, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and products. We may not be able to obtain patent rights relating to our technology or products and pending patent applications to which we have rights may not issue as patents or if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Even if issued, any patents issued to us may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nTrademark protection of our products may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage.\nWe use trademarks on our products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing them. Distinctive marks may also be important for any additional products that we successfully develop and commercially market. If we initiate legal proceedings to seek to protect our trademarks, the costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts could be unsuccessful.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nRecently enacted healthcare legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, as well as future reforms, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the PPACA was signed into law which makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. One of the principal aims of the PPACA as currently enacted is to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million uninsured Americans. The consequences of these significant coverage expansions on the sales of our products are unknown and speculative at this point.\nThe PPACA contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions, among other things. This includes new fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. Beginning in 2013, medical device manufacturers were required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) of 2.3% of certain U.S. medical device revenues. Under this provision, we have paid an excise tax of approximately $69 thousand through December 31, 2014, which tax is reflected in our operating expenses. Though there are some exceptions to the excise tax, this excise tax applies to all or most of our products sold within the U.S. The PPACA also establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; implements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians, and other providers to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and creates an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.\nThe PPACA provisions on comparative clinical effectiveness research also extend the initiatives of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, known as the stimulus package, which included $1.1 billion in funding to study the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments and strategies. This stimulus funding was designated for, among other things, conducting, supporting or reviewing research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits, clinical outcomes, effectiveness and appropriateness of products. The PPACA appropriates additional funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research. Although Congress has indicated that this funding is intended to improve the quality of health care, it remains unclear how the research will impact current Medicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third-party payor policies. The taxes imposed by the PPACA and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors using our products, and/or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to successfully commercialize our products or could limit or eliminate our spending on certain development projects.\nThe U. S. government has in the past considered, is currently considering and may in the future consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. State and local governments, as well as a number of foreign governments, are also considering or have adopted similar types of policies. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the United States or elsewhere, and current uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether other healthcare policies, including policies stemming from legislation or regulations affecting our business, may be proposed or enacted in the future; what effect such policies would have on our business; or the effect ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws governing our business practices which, if violated, could result in substantial penalties. Additionally, challenges to or investigations of our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to and could otherwise harm our business.\nThe Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback laws, and several similar state laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, prohibit payments or other remuneration that could be considered to induce hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products either to refer patients or to purchase, lease or order, or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, the recently enacted PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government or a whistleblower may assert that a claim (including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute) constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. They particularly impact how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting and other service arrangements. These laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied to specific circumstances. Violating anti-kickback laws can result in civil and criminal penalties, which can be substantial and include exclusion from government healthcare programs for noncompliance. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to defend, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe PPACA also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. Such information must be made publicly available in a searchable format. In addition, device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of approximately $0.2 million per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and were required to submit reports to CMS by March 31, 2014 and the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. We submitted a report in a timely manner and believe that we are in compliance with this reporting requirement.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians, including the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting commercial compliance environment, and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements, increases the possibility that a healthcare company may be found out of compliance of one or more of the requirements, subjecting us to significant civil monetary penalties.\nCompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our potential international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties in the U.S. and/or abroad. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we intend to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires us to track and disclose the source of certain metals used in manufacturing which may stem from minerals (so-called \u201cconflict minerals\u201d) which originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining regions. These metals include tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. In most cases no acceptable alternative material exists which has the necessary properties. It is not possible to determine the source of the metals by analysis but instead a good faith description of the source of the intermediate components and raw materials must be obtained. The components which incorporate those metals may originate from many sources and we may purchase fabricated products from manufacturers who may have a long and difficult-to-trace supply chain. As the spot price of these materials varies, producers of the metal intermediates can be expected to change the mix of sources used, and components and assemblies which we buy may have a mix of sources as their origin. We do not believe these materials are present in the component parts that we use in our CorPath System, but there can be no assurance that these metals will not be included in our components and assemblies from time to time.\nOur products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain domestic regulatory review process. If we do not obtain and maintain the necessary domestic regulatory authorizations, we will not be able to provide our products in the U.S.\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, bench and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, promotion, sales, distribution and post-market support and reporting of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In order for us to market certain products for use in the U.S., we generally must first obtain clearance from the FDA pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. Clearance under Section 510(k) requires demonstration that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered (\u201cpre-amendment\u201d) status. If we significantly modify our products after they receive FDA clearance, or seek to market them for additional indications for use, the FDA may require us to submit a separate 510(k) or PMA for the modified product before we are permitted to market the products in the U.S. In addition, if we develop products in the future that are not considered to be substantially equivalent to a device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered status, we will be required to obtain FDA approval by submitting a PMA. The FDA may not act favorably or quickly in its review of our 510(k) or PMA submissions or we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain FDA clearance or approval, any of which could delay or preclude our sale of new products in the U.S. Furthermore, the FDA may request additional data or require us to conduct further testing, or compile more data, including clinical data and clinical studies, in support of a 510(k) submission. Regulatory policy affecting our products can change at any time. The changes and their impact on our business cannot be accurately predicted. For example, in 2011, the FDA announced a Plan of Action to modernize and improve the FDA\u2019s premarket review of medical devices, and has implemented, and continues to implement, reforms intended to streamline the premarket review process. In addition, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, Congress enacted several reforms through the Medical Device Regulatory Improvements and additional miscellaneous provisions which will further affect both pre- and post-approval medical device regulation. Changes in the FDA 510(k) process could make approval more difficult to obtain, increase delay, add uncertainty and have other significant adverse effects on our ability to obtain and maintain approval for our products. The FDA may also, instead of accepting a 510(k) submission, require us to submit a PMA, which is typically a much more complex, lengthy and burdensome application than a 510(k). To support a PMA, the FDA would likely require that we conduct one\nor more clinical studies to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective. In some cases such studies may be requested for a 510(k) as well. We may not be able to meet the requirements to obtain 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, in which case the FDA may not grant any necessary clearances or approvals. In addition, the FDA may place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition to a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Product applications can also be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following clearance or approval. Any delays or failure to obtain FDA clearance or approval of new products we develop, any limitations imposed by the FDA on new product use or the costs of obtaining FDA clearance or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and IRB approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a \u201csignificant risk\u201d (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an IDE application. Our system product would be considered a significant risk device requiring IDE approval prior to investigational use. We may not be able to obtain FDA or IRB approval to undertake clinical trials in the U.S. for any new devices we intend to market in the U.S. in the future. If we obtain such approvals, we may not be able to conduct studies which comply with the IDE and other regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from any such trials may not support clearance or approval of the investigational device. Failure to obtain such approvals or to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certainty that clinical trials will meet desired endpoints, produce meaningful or useful data and be free of unexpected adverse effects, or that the FDA will accept the validity of foreign clinical study data cannot be assured, and such uncertainty could preclude or delay market clearance or authorizations resulting in significant financial costs and reduced revenue.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory clearances in other countries for existing products or products under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products in those countries.\nIn order to market our products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding quality, safety and efficacy of our products. Approval and CE marking procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval or CE Certificate of Conformity in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA clearance. The regulatory approval or CE marking process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA clearance in the United States. Regulatory approval or the CE marking of a product in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects described above regarding FDA clearance in the United States.\nFor example, in the EEA, our devices are required to comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive (applicable in the non-EU EEA Member States via the Agreement on the European Economic Area). We are also required to ensure compliance with the relevant quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. Companies compliant with ISO requirements such as \u201cEN ISO 13485: 2003 Medical devices - Quality management systems - Requirements for regulatory purposes\u201d benefit from a presumption of conformity with the relevant Essential Requirements or the quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. Following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements and quality system requirements, the Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. We received a CE Certificate of Conformity for our CorPath System in 2011. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in meeting and continuing to meet the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive in the EEA.\nWe may incur liability related to the off-label use of our products.\nThe FDA and the FTC also regulate the advertising claims of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. The off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business, or result in costly investigations and sanctions from the FDA and other regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion.\nWe may incur substantial product liability or indemnification claims relating to the clinical testing of our CorPath System.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our CorPath System in human clinical trials, and claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of our CorPath System causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. Because our CorPath System is designed to be used in complex surgical procedures, defects could result in a number of complications, including serious personal injury or death. While we have and intend to maintain product liability insurance relating to our clinical trials, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us and we may be unable to maintain such insurance. Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to our products. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnification obligations. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nThere are a number of federal and state laws in the United States protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use or disclosure. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy rules under HIPAA (or other applicable federal or state laws), we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nComplying with FDA regulations is a complex process, and our failure to comply fully could subject us to significant enforcement actions.\nBecause our products are commercially distributed, numerous quality and post-market regulatory requirements apply, including the following:\n\u2022\ncontinued compliance to the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the development and manufacturing process,\n\u2022\nlabeling regulations,\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s general prohibition against false or misleading statements in the labeling or promotion of products for unapproved uses,\n\u2022\nstringent complaint reporting and Medical Device Reporting regulations, which requires that manufacturers keep detailed records of investigations or complaints against their devices and to report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur,\n\u2022\nadequate use of the Corrective and Preventive Actions process to identify and correct or prevent significant systemic failures of products or processes or in trends which suggest same, and\n\u2022\nthe reporting of Corrections and Removals, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA recalls and field corrective actions taken to reduce a risk to health or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may pose a risk to health.\nWe are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, it can institute a wide variety of regulatory or enforcement actions, ranging from inspectional observations (Form FDA 483) to a public Warning Letter to more severe civil and criminal sanctions including the seizure of our products and equipment or a ban on the import or export of our products. Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny modification or change of medical devices cleared for market requires the manufacturer to make a determination whether the change is significant enough to require new 510(k) clearance. We have created labeling, advertising and user training for our CorPath System to describe specific procedures that we believe are fully within the scope of our existing 510(k) indications for use stated in our 510(k) clearances. We cannot assure that the FDA would agree that all such specific procedures are within the scope of the existing general clearance or that we have compiled adequate information to support the safety and efficacy of using the CorPath System for all such specific procedures.\nIf our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal, state or other manufacturing standards, we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations, distribution of our products and/or recall our products which would result in significant product delivery delays and lost revenue.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations will continue to be regulated and inspected by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements contained in the QSR and other regulatory requirements. For any CorPath Systems shipped internationally, we are also required to comply with ISO quality system standards as well as European Directives and norms in order to produce products for sale in the EU. In addition, many countries such as Canada and Japan have very specific additional regulatory requirements for quality assurance and manufacturing. If we fail to continue to comply with cGMP requirements, as well as ISO or other regulatory standards, we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThere is a limited trading market for our Common Stock, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nThere currently is a limited market for our Common Stock. An investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the Common Stock and trading of our Common Stock may be sporadic. For example, several days may pass before any shares may be traded. A more active market for the Common Stock may never develop. We cannot assure you that the volume of trading in shares of our Common Stock will increase in the future. Additionally, general market forces may have a negative effect on our stock price, independent of factors affecting our Common Stock specifically. In addition, if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling the Common Stock, which may adversely affect the market for our Common Stock. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nUnless our Common Stock is listed on a qualified national securities exchange or our Common Stock price exceeds $5 per share, our Common Stock will be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and will not qualify for exemption from the \u201cpenny stock\u201d restrictions, which may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares.\nOur Common Stock is traded on the OTCQB as provided by OTC Market Groups, Inc. (\u201cOTCQB\u201d) at a price of less than $5.00 per share and, as a result, is considered as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d by the SEC and subject to rules adopted by the SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that is not listed on a qualified national securities exchange and that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, these rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d of a disclosure schedule relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market. Disclosure is also required to be made about current quotations for the securities and commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative. Finally, broker-dealers must send monthly statements to purchasers of \u201cpenny stocks\u201d disclosing recent price information for the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in the account and information on the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d. As a result of our Common Stock being subject to the rules on \u201cpenny stocks,\u201d the liquidity of our Common Stock may be adversely affected.\nThe price of our Common Stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of an active trading market on that stock exchange or any other exchange in the future. The trading price of our common shares has experienced volatility while trading on the OTCQB and is likely to continue to be highly volatile in response to a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\ntrading of our Common Stock on the OTCQB;\n\u2022\nlimited daily trading volume resulting in the lack of a liquid market;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in price and volume due to investor speculation and other factors that may not be tied to our financial performance;\n\u2022\nperformance by us in the execution of our business plan;\n\u2022\nfinancial viability; actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of our common shares or other securities in the open market;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nperformance of products sold and advertised by licensees in the marketplace;\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors;\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in financial results; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, and several recent situations, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has been initiated against such company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nOur stock is thinly traded and our stock price can fluctuate.\nLow volume of trading activity and volatility in the price of our Common Stock may make it difficult for you to resell your Common Stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the medical device industry;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us or our competitors and other medical device companies;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results as evidenced by the current volatility and disruption of capital and credit markets.\nIf we are unable to successfully remediate the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting or if additional material weaknesses are discovered in our internal accounting procedures, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our Common Stock.\nIn connection with the audit of our 2014 consolidated financial statements, our independent registered public accounting firm noted a material weakness in our controls relating to our accounting for overhead costs which affected inventories and property and equipment. Specifically, our cost accounting and reserve estimate processes lacked adequate levels of monitoring and review controls to identify and correct inventory valuation errors in a timely manner, which was primarily the result of an insufficient number of qualified accounting resources to ensure adequate technical review of inventory accounting issues during the financial statement close process. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our operating results and prevent us from meeting our reporting obligations. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our Common Stock could drop significantly. In addition, investors relying upon this misinformation could make an uninformed investment decision, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Commission or other regulatory authorities or to stockholder class action securities litigation.\nWe cannot assure you that measures being taken in order to remediate the material weakness described above will fully remediate such material weakness. We also cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing control deficiencies or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses.\nWe intend to issue more shares to raise capital, which will result in substantial dilution.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of a maximum of 250,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. Any additional financings effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and the substantial dilution in the percentage of Common Stock held by our then existing stockholders. Moreover, the Common Stock issued in any such transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or non-arm\u2019s-length basis by our management, resulting in an additional reduction in the percentage of Common Stock held by our current stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval. To the extent that additional shares of capital stock are issued in connection with a financing, dilution to the interests of our stockholders will occur and the rights of the holder of Common Stock might be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Board of Directors may issue and fix the terms of shares of our Preferred Stock without stockholder approval, which could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our Common Stock or any change in control of our Company.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share, with such designation rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue shares of Preferred Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our Common Stock. In the event of such issuances, the Preferred Stock could be used, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company.\nFuture sales by our stockholders may negatively affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nSales of our Common Stock in the public market could lower the market price of our Common Stock. Sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable or at all. Of the 105,883,157 shares of Common Stock currently issued and outstanding, approximately 11,510,300 shares are freely tradable without restriction by stockholders who are not our affiliates. We issued an aggregate of 73,360,287 shares of Common Stock to the former shareholder of Corindus, Inc. pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act, and such shares are \u201crestricted securities\u201d as defined in Rule 144. In addition to being subject to restrictions on transfer imposed under federal securities laws, each holder of the newly issued shares entered into a lock-up agreement, which among other things, restricts the sale or transfer of these shares for specified periods. Our affiliates hold 79,533,257 shares, all of which shares may be resold in the public market only when released from the provisions of a lock-up agreement, when and if registered pursuant to an exemption from registration, or pursuant to the applicable requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933. Although we have no current plans to do so, we may waive the restrictions on transfer under these lock-up agreements in the future. When the shares covered under the lock-up agreements become available for resale, sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could materially adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nInsiders have substantial control over the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control, including a transaction in which the Company\u2019s stockholders could sell or exchange their shares for a premium.\nOur directors and executive officers beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 51% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, our directors and executive officers, if acting together, may have the ability to affect the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these persons acting together may have the ability to control our management and business affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the value of our Common Stock by:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control,\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination, or\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making an acquisition proposal or otherwise attempting to obtain control.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe do not anticipate that we will declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, you will only realize an economic gain on your investment in our Common Stock if the price appreciates. Since we do not pay dividends, and if we are not successful in establishing an orderly trading market for our shares, then investors may not have any manner to liquidate or receive any payment on their investment. Therefore, our failure to pay dividends may cause investors to not see any return on their investment even if we are successful in our business operations. In addition, because we do not pay dividends we may have trouble raising additional funds which could affect our ability to expand our business operations.\nSecurities analysts may not cover our Common Stock and this may have a negative impact on our Common Stock\u2019s market price.\nThe future trading market for our Common Stock may depend on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. We may face additional risks since we became a public company through an acquisition which, for accounting purposes, was treated as a reverse merger. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our Common Stock and there may be little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our Common Stock. If securities analysts do not cover our Common Stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect our Common Stock\u2019s market price, if any. If we are covered by securities analysts who downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are likely to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing capital stock.\nWe have financed our operations, and we expect to continue to finance our operations, make acquisitions and develop strategic relationships by issuing equity or convertible debt securities which could significantly reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, any newly issued securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing Common Stock. Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. We may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt, and the holders of any debt we may issue would have rights superior to your rights in the event we are not successful and are forced to seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws.\nA significant business or product announcement by us or our competitors may cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may be subject to substantial volatility as a result of announcements by us or other companies in our industry. Announcements that may subject the price of our Common Stock to substantial volatility include announcements regarding:\n\u2022\nour operating results, including the amount and timing of sales of our products,\n\u2022\nthe availability and timely delivery of our products,\n\u2022\nthe acquisition of technologies or products by us or our competitors,\n\u2022\nthe development of new technologies or products by us or our competitors,\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our products or those of our competitors, and\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors.\nThe lack of substantial public company experience of our management team could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of U.S. securities laws.\nOur management team has limited experience in working with public companies which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements, including the establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which is necessary to maintain our public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations, our ability to continue as a public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our Company.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period.\nWe anticipate that there may be fluctuations in our future operating results. Potential causes of future fluctuations in our operating results may include:\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in financial results,\n\u2022\nissues in manufacturing products,\n\u2022\nunanticipated potential product liability claims,\n\u2022\nthe introduction of technological innovations by competitors,\n\u2022\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key strategic alliance agreements,\n\u2022\nthe initiation of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights,\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees,\n\u2022\nregulatory changes,\n\u2022\nfailure of our products to achieve commercial success,\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect research and development expenditures,\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our Common Stock, and\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems resulting from proposed healthcare legislation or otherwise.\nMoreover, stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOur stock price may be subject to fluctuation which may cause an investment in our Common Stock to suffer a decline in value.\nThe market price of our Common Stock is currently undeveloped. Once a market is developed, our stock prices may fluctuate significantly in response to factors that are beyond our control. The stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of medical device companies have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock which could cause a decline in the value of our Common Stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nOur management will be devoting substantial time to comply with public company regulations.\nAs a public company, we will be subject to certain rules and regulations. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the Commission impose various requirements on public companies with respect to corporate governance practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that our management maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and, as applicable, our independent registered public accounting firm, to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with the foregoing will require us to expend significant management efforts.\nWe will incur significant costs to be a public company to ensure compliance with corporate governance and accounting requirements and insure our officers and directors and we may not be able to absorb such costs.\nWe will incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with applicable corporate governance and accounting requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules implemented by the Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.", "PERMNO": 15344, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CVRS"}
