{"cik": "1166388", "company": "VERINT SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nMany of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risks and uncertainties. The factors described below are\nrisks that could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These are not all the risks we face and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may have a material adverse impact on our future operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCompetition, Markets, and Operations\nOur business is impacted by changes in general economic conditions and information technology and government spending in particular.\nOur business is subject to risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions. Slowdowns, recessions, economic instability, political unrest, armed conflicts, or natural disasters around the world may cause companies and governments to delay, reduce, or even cancel planned spending. In particular, declines in information technology spending and limited or reduced government budgets have affected the markets for our solutions in both the Enterprise Intelligence market and the Security Intelligence market in certain periods and in certain regions. For the year ended January 31, 2016, approximately one third of our business was generated from contracts with various governments around the world, including national, regional, and local government agencies. We expect that government contracts will continue to be a significant source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Customers or partners who are facing business challenges, reduced budgets, or liquidity issues are also more likely to defer purchase decisions or cancel or reduce orders, as well as to delay or default on payments. In the year ended January 31, 2016, we experienced extended sales cycles, particularly for large projects, a reduction in deal sizes, and pressure on maintenance renewals for our Enterprise Intelligence solutions. This trend regarding extended sales cycles and reduced deal sizes was particularly acute for our Security Intelligence business which has significant exposure to emerging markets where budgets have been reduced significantly due to weak economic conditions and currency devaluations. If customers or partners significantly reduce their spending with us or significantly delay or fail to make payments to us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nThe industry in which we operate is characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards and challenges, and changing market potential from area to area, and if we cannot anticipate and react to such changes our results may suffer.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards and challenges. The introduction of products embodying new technology, new delivery platforms such as SaaS, managed services, or other cloud-based solutions, the commoditization of older technologies, and the emergence of new industry standards and technological hurdles can exert pricing pressure on existing products and/or render them unmarketable or obsolete. For example, in our Security Intelligence business, stronger and more frequent use of encryption has created significantly greater challenges for our customers and for our solutions to address. Moreover, the market potential and growth rates of the markets we serve are not uniform and are evolving. It is critical to our success that we are able to anticipate and respond to changes in technology and industry standards and new customer challenges by consistently developing new, innovative, high-quality products and services that meet or exceed the changing needs of our customers. We must also successfully identify, enter, and appropriately prioritize areas of growing market potential, including by launching, successfully executing, and driving demand for new and enhanced solutions and services, while simultaneously preserving our legacy businesses. If we are unable to execute on these strategic priorities, we may lose market share or experience slower growth, and our profitability and other results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIntense competition in our markets and competitors with greater resources than us may limit our market share, profitability, and growth.\nWe face aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all of our markets, making it difficult to maintain market share, remain profitable, invest, and grow. We are also encountering new competitors as we expand into new markets. Our competitors may be able to more quickly develop or adapt to new or emerging technologies, better respond to changes in customer needs or preferences, better identify and enter into new areas of growth, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products. Some of our competitors have, in relation to us, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer standing relationships with customers, superior brand recognition, superior margins, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, customer service, public relations, distribution, or other resources, especially in new markets we may enter. Consolidation among our competitors may also improve their competitive position. In recent years, several companies significantly larger than we are have also entered or increased their presence in our markets through internal development, partnerships, and acquisitions, and we have encountered larger competitors as we have expanded into new markets. We also face competition from solutions developed internally by our customers or partners. To the extent that we cannot compete effectively, our market share and, therefore, results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause price and related terms are key considerations for many of our customers, we may have to accept less-favorable payment terms, lower the prices of our products and services, and/or reduce our cost structure, including reducing headcount or investment in R&D, in order to remain competitive. If we are forced to take these kinds of actions to remain competitive in the short-term, such actions may adversely impact our ability to execute and compete in the long-term.\nOur future success depends on our ability to enhance our existing operations, execute on our growth strategy, and properly manage investment in our business and operations.\nWe experienced significant growth in recent years and our existing infrastructure, systems, processes, and personnel may not be adequate for our current or future needs. A key element of our long-term strategy is to continue to invest in, enhance, and secure our business and operations and grow, both organically and through acquisitions. Investments in, among other things, new markets, new products, solutions, and technologies, R&D, infrastructure and systems, geographic expansion, and headcount are critical components in achieving this strategy. However, such investments and efforts may not be successful, especially in new areas or new markets in which we have little or no experience, and even if successful, may negatively impact our short-term profitability. Our success depends on our ability to effectively and efficiently enhance our existing operations and execute on our growth strategy, including our ability to properly allocate limited investment dollars, balance the extent and timing of investments with the associated impact on expenses and profitability, balance our focus between new areas or new markets and the operation and servicing of our legacy businesses and customers, capture efficiencies and economies of scale, and compete in the new areas or new markets and with the new solutions in which we have invested. If we are unable to effectively and efficiently enhance our existing operations, execute on our growth strategy, and properly manage our investments, focus, and expenditures, our results of operations and market share may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable targets for acquisition or investment, or complete acquisitions or investments on terms acceptable to us, which could negatively impact our ability to implement our growth strategy.\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we have made a number of acquisitions and investments and expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in the future, subject to the terms of our senior credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), the indenture governing our 1.50% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2021 (the \"Notes\"), and other restrictions.\nIn many areas, we have seen the market for acquisitions become more competitive and valuations increase. Our competitors also continue to make acquisitions in or adjacent to our markets. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to identify suitable acquisition or investment targets or to consummate acquisitions or investments once identified on acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to execute on our acquisition strategy, we may not be able to achieve our long-term growth strategy, may lose market share, or may lose our leadership position in one or more of our markets.\nOur acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business, operations, and financial position.\nAcquisitions and investments are an important part of our strategy. Successful execution following the closing of an acquisition or investment is paramount to achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction. If we are unable to execute successfully, we may experience both a loss on the investment and damage to our legacy business and valuation.\nThe process of integrating an acquired company's business into our operations and investing in new technologies is challenging and may result in expected or unexpected operating or compliance challenges, which may require significant expenditures and a significant amount of our management's attention that would otherwise be focused on the ongoing operation of our business. The potential difficulties or risks of integrating an acquired company\u2019s business include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic positions and our reputation;\n\u2022\nrisk that we fail to successfully implement our business plan for the combined business, including plans to accelerate growth;\n\u2022\nrisk that we are unable to obtain the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including synergies or economies of scale;\n\u2022\nrisk that the market does not accept the integrated product portfolio;\n\u2022\nchallenges in reconciling business practices or in integrating product development activities, logistics, or information technology and other systems;\n\u2022\nretention risk with respect to key customers, suppliers, and employees and challenges in assimilating and training new employees;\n\u2022\nchallenges in complying with newly applicable laws and regulations, including obtaining or retaining required approvals, licenses, and permits; and\n\u2022\npotential impact on our internal controls over financial reporting.\nAcquisitions and/or investments may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the expenditure of available cash, and amortization expenses or write-downs related to intangible assets such as goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. Investments in immature businesses with unproven track records and technologies have an especially high degree of risk, with the possibility that we may lose our entire investment or incur unexpected liabilities. Transactions that are not immediately accretive to earnings may make it more difficult for us to maintain satisfactory profitability levels or compliance with the maximum leverage ratio covenant under the revolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement. Large or costly acquisitions or investments may also diminish our capital resources and liquidity or limit our ability to engage in additional transactions for a period of time.\nAll of the foregoing risks may be magnified as the cost, size, or complexity of an acquisition or acquired company increases, where the acquired company\u2019s products, market, or business are materially different from ours, or where more than one integration is occurring simultaneously or within a concentrated period of time. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in making additional acquisitions in the future or in integrating or executing on our business plan for existing or future acquisitions.\nOur solutions may contain defects or may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which could expose us to both financial and non-financial damages.\nMany of our existing solutions are and future solutions are expected to be sophisticated and may develop operational problems. New products and new product versions, new service models such as hosting, SaaS, and managed services, and the incorporation of third-party products or services into our solutions, also give rise to the risk of defects or errors. These defects or errors may relate to the operation or the security of the products. If we do not discover and remedy such defects, errors, or other operational or security problems until after a product has been released to customers or partners, we may incur significant costs to correct such problems and/or become liable for substantial damages for product liability claims or other liabilities. Moreover, even products or services that are well-designed and tested may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. If one or more of our products or services, including elements provided by third-party suppliers or partners, are found to have defects or errors, or if there is a successful cyber-attack on one of our products or services even absent a defect or error, it may also result in questions regarding the integrity of our products or services generally, which could cause adverse publicity and impair their market acceptance and could have a material adverse effect on our results or financial condition.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain our relationships with third parties that market and sell our products, our business and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.\nApproximately half of our sales are made through partners, distributors, resellers, and systems integrators. To remain successful, we must maintain our existing relationships as well as identify and establish new relationships with such third parties. We must often compete with other suppliers for these relationships and our competitors often seek to establish exclusive relationships with these sales channels or to become a preferred partner for them. Our ability to establish and maintain these relationships is based on, among other things, factors that are similar to those on which we compete for end customers, including features, functionality, ease of use, installation and maintenance, and price. Even if we are able to secure such relationships on terms we find acceptable, there is no assurance that we will be able to realize the benefits we anticipate.\nSome of our channel partners may also compete with us or have affiliates that compete with us, or may partner with our competitors or even offer our products and those of our competitors as alternatives when presenting proposals to end customers. Our ability to achieve our revenue goals and growth depends to a significant extent on maintaining, enabling, and adding to these sales channels, and if we are unable to do so, our business and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.\nThe sophisticated nature of our solutions, sales cycle, and unpredictable sales terms and timing may create uncertainty in, or negatively impact, our operating results and make such results more volatile and difficult to predict.\nThe timing of our sales cycle ranges from as little as a few weeks to more than a year. Our larger sales, which we have historically emphasized in our sales strategy, typically require a minimum of a few months to consummate. As the length or complexity of a sales process increases, so does the risk of successfully closing the sale. Larger sales are often made by competitive bid, which also increases the time and uncertainty associated with such opportunities. In addition, because many of our solutions are sophisticated, customers may also require education on the value and functionality of our solutions as part of the sales process, further extending the time frame and uncertainty of the process.\nLonger sales cycles, competitive bid processes, and the need to educate customers means that:\n\u2022\nThere is greater risk of customers deferring, scaling back, or cancelling sales as a result of, among other things, their receipt of a competitive proposal, changes in budgets and purchasing priorities, or the introduction or anticipated introduction of new or enhanced products by us or our competitors during the process.\n\u2022\nWe may make a significant investment of time and money in opportunities that do not come to fruition, which investments may not be usable or recoverable in future projects.\n\u2022\nWe may be required to bid on a project in advance of the completion of its design or be required to begin working on a project in advance of finalizing a sale, in either case, increasing the risk of unforeseen technological difficulties or cost overruns.\n\u2022\nWe face greater downside risks if we do not correctly and efficiently deploy limited personnel and financial resources and convert such sales opportunities into orders.\nLarger solution sales also require greater expertise in sales execution and transaction implementation than more basic product sales, including in establishing and maintaining appropriate contacts and relationships with customers and partners, product development, project management, staffing, integration, services, and support. Additionally, after the completion of a solution sale or the sale of a more sophisticated product in general, our customers or partners may need assistance from us in making full use of the functionality of these solutions or products, in realizing all of their benefits, or in implementation generally. If we are unable to assist our customers and partners in realizing the benefits they expect from our solutions and products, demand for our solutions and products may decline and our operating results may suffer.\nThe extended time frame and uncertainty associated with many of our sales opportunities also makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenues (and attendant budgeting and guidance decisions) and increases the volatility of our operating results from period to period. Our ability to forecast and the volatility of our operating results is also impacted by the fact that pricing, margins, and other deal terms may vary substantially from transaction to transaction, especially across business lines. The terms of our transactions, including with respect to pricing, future deliverables, delivery model (e.g., perpetual license versus SaaS), and post-contract customer support, also impact the timing of our ability to recognize revenue. Because these transaction-specific factors are difficult to predict in advance, this also complicates the forecasting of revenue. The deferral or loss of one or more significant orders or a delay in a large implementation can also materially adversely affect our operating results, especially in a given quarter. As with other software-focused companies, a large amount of our quarterly business tends to come in the last few weeks, or even the last few days, of each quarter. This trend has also complicated the process of accurately predicting revenue and other operating results, particularly on a quarterly basis. Finally, our business is subject to seasonal factors that may also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nFor certain products, components, or services, we rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers, and partners, and if these relationships are interrupted we may not be able to obtain substitute suppliers, manufacturers, or partners on favorable terms or at all and we may be subject to other adverse effects.\nAlthough we generally use standard parts and components in our products, we do rely on non-affiliated suppliers and OEM partners for certain non-standard products or components which may be critical to our products, including both hardware and\nsoftware, and on manufacturers of assemblies that are incorporated into our products. We also purchase technology, license intellectual property rights, and oversee third-party development and localization of certain products or components, in some cases, by or from companies that may compete with us or work with our competitors. While we endeavor to use larger, more established suppliers, manufacturers, and partners wherever possible, in some cases, these providers may be smaller, less established companies, particularly in the case of suppliers of new or unique technologies that we have not developed internally. If these suppliers, manufacturers, or partners experience financial, operational, manufacturing capacity, or quality assurance difficulties, cease production or sale of the products we buy from them entirely, or there is any other disruption, including loss of license, OEM, or distribution rights, including as a result of the acquisition of a supplier or partner by a competitor, we will be required to locate alternative sources of supply or manufacturing, to internally develop the applicable technologies, to redesign our products, and/or to remove certain features from our products, any of which would be likely to increase expenses, create delivery delays, and negatively impact our sales. Although we endeavor to put in place contracts with key providers, including protections such as source code escrows (where needed), warranties, and indemnities, we may not be successful in obtaining adequate protections, these agreements may be short-term in duration, and the counterparties may be unwilling or unable to stand behind such protections. Moreover, these types of contractual protections offer limited practical benefits to us in the event our relationship with a key provider is interrupted.\nWe also rely on third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including hosting partners and providers of other cloud-based services. If these third-party providers do not perform as expected, our customers may be adversely affected, resulting in potential liability and negative exposure for us. If it is necessary to migrate these services to other providers as a result of poor performance by these third parties, cyber breaches, security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it could result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time and expense to us, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we cannot retain and recruit qualified personnel, our ability to operate and grow our business may be impaired.\nWe depend on the continued services of our management and employees to run and grow our business. To remain successful and to grow, we need to retain existing employees and attract new employees who understand and/or have experience with our products, services, and markets, including new markets and growth areas we may enter. As we grow, we must also enhance and expand our management team to execute on new and larger agendas and challenges. The market for qualified personnel is competitive in the geographies in which we operate and may be limited especially in areas of emerging technology, and we may be at a disadvantage to companies with greater brand recognition or financial resources in recruiting. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, when and where they are needed, our ability to operate and grow our business could be impaired. Moreover, if we are not able to properly balance investment in personnel with growth in our business, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nBecause we have significant foreign operations and business, we are subject to geopolitical and other risks that could materially adversely affect our results.\nWe have significant operations and business outside the United States, including sales, research and development, manufacturing, customer services and support, and administrative services. The countries in which we have our most significant foreign operations include Israel, the United Kingdom, India, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Cyprus, Australia, and Brazil. We also generate significant revenue from more than 20 foreign countries, and smaller amounts of revenue from dozens more, including a number of emerging markets. We intend to continue to grow our business internationally.\nOur foreign operations are, and any future foreign growth will be, subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\npolitical, security, and economic instability or corruption in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in and compliance with both international and local laws and regulations, including those related to trade compliance, anticorruption, data privacy and protection, tax, labor, employee benefits, customs, currency restrictions, and other requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferences in tax regimes and potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nproduct customization or localization issues;\n\u2022\npreferences for or policies and procedures that protect local suppliers;\n\u2022\nlegal uncertainties regarding intellectual property rights or rights and obligations generally;\n\u2022\nrecruitment and retention of qualified foreign employees; and\n\u2022\nchallenges or delays in collection of accounts receivable.\nAny or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nConditions in and our relationship to Israel may materially adversely affect our operations and personnel and may limit our ability to produce and sell our products or engage in certain transactions.\nWe have significant operations in Israel, including R&D, manufacturing, sales, and support.\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighbors, which in the past have led, and may in the future lead, to security and economic problems for Israel. In addition, Israel has faced and continues to face difficult relations with the Palestinians and the risk of terrorist violence from both Palestinian as well as foreign elements such as Hezbollah. Infighting among the Palestinians may also create security and economic risks to Israel. Current and future conflicts and political, economic, and/or military conditions in Israel and the Middle East region have affected and may in the future affect our operations in Israel. The exacerbation of violence within Israel or the outbreak of violent conflicts between Israel and its neighbors, including Iran, may impede our ability to manufacture, sell, and support our products or engage in R&D, or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. In addition, many of our employees in Israel are required to perform annual compulsory military service and are subject to being called to active duty at any time. The absence of these employees may have an adverse effect on our operations. Hostilities involving Israel may also result in the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nRestrictive laws, policies, or practices in certain countries directed toward Israel, Israeli goods, or companies having operations in Israel may also limit our ability to sell some of our products in certain countries.\nWe receive grants from the OCS for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures in Israel. The availability in any given year of these OCS grants depends on OCS approval of the projects and related budgets that we submit to the OCS each year. The Israeli law under which these OCS grants are made limits our ability to manufacture products, or transfer technologies, developed using these grants outside of Israel. This may limit our ability to engage in certain outsourcing or business combination transactions involving these products or require us to pay significant royalties or fees to the OCS in order to obtain any OCS consent that may be required in connection with such transactions.\nWe are subject to complex, evolving regulatory requirements that may be difficult and expensive to comply with and that could negatively impact our business.\nOur business and operations are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements in the United States and abroad, including, among other things, with respect to government contracts, labor, tax, import and export, anti-corruption, information security, data privacy, and communications monitoring and interception. Compliance with these regulatory requirements may be onerous, time-consuming, and expensive, especially where these requirements are inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or where the jurisdictional reach of certain requirements is not clearly defined or seeks to reach across national borders. Regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may make it difficult or impossible to do business in another jurisdiction. We may also be unsuccessful in obtaining permits, licenses, or other authorizations required to operate our business, such as for the marketing or sale or import or export of our products and services.\nWhile we have implemented policies, procedures, and systems designed to achieve compliance with these regulatory requirements, we cannot assure you that these policies, procedures, or systems will be adequate or that we or our personnel will not violate these policies and procedures or applicable laws and regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations may harm our reputation and deter government agencies and other existing or potential customers or partners from purchasing our solutions. Furthermore, non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, restrictions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.\nRegulatory requirements, such as laws requiring telecommunications providers to facilitate the monitoring of communications by law enforcement, may also influence market demand for many of our products and/or customer requirements for specific\nfunctionality and performance or technical standards. The domestic and international regulatory environment is subject to constant change, often based on factors beyond our control or anticipation, including political climate, budgets, and current events, which could reduce demand for our products or require us to change or redesign products to maintain compliance or competitiveness.\nLoss of security clearances or political factors may adversely affect our business.\nSome of our subsidiaries maintain security clearances domestically and abroad in connection with the development, marketing, sale, and support of our Security Intelligence solutions. These clearances are reviewed from time to time by these countries and could be deactivated, including for political reasons unrelated to the merits of our solutions, such as the list of countries we do business with or the fact that our local entity is controlled by or affiliated with an entity based in another country. If we lose our security clearances in a particular country, we may be unable to sell our Security Intelligence solutions for secure projects in that country and might also experience greater challenges in selling such solutions even for non-secure projects in that country. Even if we are able to obtain and maintain applicable security clearances, government customers may decline to purchase our Security Intelligence solutions if they were not developed or manufactured in that country or if they were developed or manufactured in other countries that are considered disfavored by such country. We may also experience negative publicity or other adverse impacts on our business if we sell our Security Intelligence solutions to countries that are considered disfavored by the media or political or social rights organizations even though such transactions may be permissible under applicable law.\nInformation / Product Security and Intellectual Property\nOur intellectual property may not be adequately protected.\nWhile much of our intellectual property is protected by patents or patent applications, we have not and cannot protect all of our intellectual property with patents or other registrations. There can be no assurance that patents we have applied for will be issued on the basis of our patent applications or that, if such patents are issued, they will be, or that our existing patents are, sufficiently broad enough to protect our technologies, products, or services. Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, designed around, or challenged.\nIn order to safeguard our unpatented proprietary know-how, source code, trade secrets, and technology, we rely primarily upon trade secret protection and non-disclosure provisions in agreements with employees and other third parties having access to our confidential information. There can be no assurance that these measures will adequately protect us from improper disclosure or misappropriation of our proprietary information.\nPreventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is difficult even in jurisdictions with well-established legal protections for intellectual property such as the United States. It may be even more difficult to protect our intellectual property in other jurisdictions where legal protections for intellectual property rights are less established. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third-party use or infringement, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nOur products may infringe or may be alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could lead to costly disputes or disruptions for us and may require us to indemnify our customers and resellers for any damages they suffer.\nThe technology industry is characterized by frequent allegations of intellectual property infringement. In the past, third parties have asserted that certain of our products infringed upon their intellectual property rights and similar claims may be made in the future. Any allegation of infringement against us could be time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve, result in substantial diversion of management resources, cause product shipment delays, or force us to enter into royalty or license agreements. If patent holders or other holders of intellectual property initiate legal proceedings against us, either with respect to our own intellectual property or intellectual property we license from third parties, we may be forced into protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of these claims. We may not be successful in defending such litigation, in part due to the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation, and may not be able to procure any required royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers. Subject to certain limitations, we generally indemnify our customers and resellers with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties, which, in some cases, may not be limited to a specified maximum amount and for which we may not have sufficient insurance coverage or adequate indemnification in the case of intellectual property licensed from a third party. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages, be required to obtain licenses for the products our customers or partners use, or incur significant expenses in developing non-infringing\nalternatives. If we cannot obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using or, in the case of resellers and other partners, stop selling our products.\nUse of free or open source software could expose our products to unintended restrictions and could materially adversely affect our business.\nSome of our products contain free or open source software (together, open source software) and we anticipate making use of open source software in the future. Open source software is generally covered by license agreements that permit the user to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software without cost, provided that the users and modifiers abide by certain licensing requirements. The original developers of the open source software generally provide no warranties on such software or protections in the event the open source software infringes a third party's intellectual property rights. Although we endeavor to monitor the use of open source software in our product development, we cannot assure you that past, present, or future products will not contain open source software elements that impose unfavorable licensing restrictions or other requirements on our products, including the need to seek licenses from third parties, to re-engineer affected products, to discontinue sales of affected products, or to release all or portions of the source code of affected products. Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe mishandling or the perceived mishandling of sensitive information could harm our business.\nOur products are in some cases used by customers to compile and analyze highly sensitive or confidential information and data, including information or data used in intelligence gathering or law enforcement activities. While our customers' use of our products in no way affords us access to the customer's sensitive or confidential information or data, we or our partners may receive or come into contact with such information or data, including personally identifiable information, when we are asked to perform services or support functions for our customers. We or our partners may also receive or come into contact with such information or data in connection with our SaaS or other hosted or managed services offerings. We have implemented policies and procedures, and use information technology systems, to help ensure the proper handling of such information and data, including background screening of certain service personnel, non-disclosure agreements with employees and partners, access rules, and controls on our information technology systems. Customers are also increasingly focused on the security of our products and services and we continuously work to address these concerns, including through the use of encryption, access rights, and other customary security features, which vary based on the solution in question and customer requirements. However, these measures are designed to mitigate the risks associated with handling or processing sensitive data and cannot safeguard against all risks at all times. The improper handling of sensitive data, or even the perception of such mishandling (whether or not valid), or other security lapses or breaches affecting us, our partners, or our products or services, could reduce demand for our products or services or otherwise expose us to financial or reputational harm or legal liability.\nWe may be subject to information technology system breaches, failures, or disruptions that could harm our operations, financial condition, or reputation.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to operate and manage our business and to process, maintain, and safeguard information, including information belonging to our customers, partners, and personnel. These systems may be subject to breaches, failures, or disruptions as a result of, among other things, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical security breaches, natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, new system implementations, or acts of terrorism or war. We have experienced cyber-attacks in the past and may experience them in the future, potentially with greater frequency. While we are continually working to maintain secure and reliable systems, our security, redundancy, and business continuity efforts may be ineffective or inadequate. We must continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies. Despite our efforts, it is possible that our security controls, and other procedures that we follow, may not prevent system breaches, failures, or disruptions. Such system breaches, failures, or disruptions could subject us to the loss, compromise, or disclosure of sensitive or confidential information or intellectual property, the destruction or corruption of data, financial losses from remedial actions, liabilities to customers or other third parties, damage to our reputation, delays in our ability to process orders, delays in our ability to provide products and services to customers, including SaaS or other hosted or managed services offerings, R&D or production downtimes, or delays or errors in financial reporting. Information system breaches or failures at one of our partners, including hosting providers or those who support other cloud-based offerings, may also result in similar adverse consequences. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Structure\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nBecause we have historically acquired a significant number of companies, goodwill and other intangible assets have represented a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1,454 million, or approximately 62% of our total assets, as of January 31, 2016. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment, and we assess on an as-needed basis whether there have been impairments in our other intangible assets. We make assumptions and estimates in this assessment which are complex and often subjective. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. To the extent that the factors described above change, we could be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by our acquisition of CTI or our historical affiliation with CTI and its former subsidiaries.\nAs a result of the February 2013 acquisition of our former parent company, CTI (the \"CTI Merger\"), CTI's liabilities, including contingent liabilities, have been consolidated into our financial statements. If CTI's liabilities are greater than represented, if the contingent liabilities we have assumed become fixed, or if there are obligations of CTI of which we were not aware at the time of completion of the CTI Merger, we may have exposure for those obligations and our business or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Adjustments to the CTI consolidated group's tax liability for periods prior to the CTI Merger could also affect the net operating losses (\"NOLs\") allocated to Verint as a result of the CTI Merger and cause us to incur additional tax liability in future periods.\nAs a result of our historical affiliation with CTI and other members of the historical CTI consolidated tax group, we could also become liable for taxes of other members of the CTI consolidated group for historical periods under certain circumstances. Adjustments to the historical CTI consolidated group's tax liability for periods prior to Verint\u2019s IPO could also affect the NOLs allocated to Verint in the IPO and cause us to incur additional tax liability in future periods.\nWe are entitled to certain rights to indemnification from Xura in connection with the transactions contemplated by our agreement and plan of merger with CTI (the \"CTI Merger Agreement\") and the agreements entered into in connection with the distribution by CTI to its shareholders of substantially all of its assets other than its interest in us (the \"Comverse share distribution\"). However, there is no assurance that Xura will be willing and able to provide such indemnification if needed. If we become responsible for liabilities (including tax liabilities) not covered by indemnification or substantially in excess of amounts covered by indemnification, or if Xura becomes unwilling or unable to stand behind such protections, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial results may be significantly impacted by changes in our tax position.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (including our NOL carryforwards), changes in unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United States, may from time to time review the pricing arrangements between us and our foreign subsidiaries or among our foreign subsidiaries. An adverse determination by one or more tax authorities in this regard may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets which can provide us with significant future cash tax savings if we are able to use them, including significant NOLs inherited as a result of the CTI Merger. However, the extent to which we will be able to use these NOLs may be impacted, restricted, or eliminated by a number of factors, including changes in tax rates, laws or regulations, whether we generate sufficient future taxable income, and possible adjustments to the tax attributes of CTI or its non-Verint subsidiaries for periods prior to the CTI Merger. To the extent that we are unable to utilize our NOLs or other losses, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. When we cease to have NOLs available to us in a particular tax jurisdiction, either through their expiration, disallowance, or utilization, our cash tax liability will increase in that jurisdiction.\nOur international operations subject us to currency exchange risk.\nWe earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Israeli shekel, British pound sterling, euro, and Singapore dollar, among others. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of entities using non-U.S. dollar functional currencies into U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period, meaning we are exposed to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, our net income is impacted by the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an entity\u2019s functional currency, gains or losses on which are recorded within other income (expense), net. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. However, our hedging activities are limited in scope and duration and may not be effective at reducing the U.S. dollar cost of our global operations.\nIn addition, our financial outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates subsequent to providing our financial outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which exposes us to leverage risks and subjects us to covenants which may adversely affect our operations.\nAt March 15, 2016, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $811 million under our Credit Agreement and the Notes, meaning that we are significantly leveraged. In addition, we have the ability to borrow additional amounts under our Credit Agreement, including the revolving credit facility, for a variety of purposes, including, among others, acquisitions and stock repurchases. Our leverage position may, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to repatriate cash for debt service from our foreign subsidiaries resulting in dividend tax costs or require us to adopt other disadvantageous tax structures to accommodate debt service payments; or\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to economic downturns, limit our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities, and restrict our flexibility to react to changes in market or industry conditions.\nIn addition, because the unhedged portion of our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement bears interest at a variable rate, we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates in periods where market rates exceed the interest rate floor provided by our Credit Agreement.\nThe revolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the leverage ratio covenant is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate sufficient earnings each quarter, or in the alternative, to reduce expenses and/or reduce the level of our outstanding debt, and we cannot assure that we will be successful in any or all of these regards.\nOur Credit Agreement also includes a number of restrictive covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or liens or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\nchange our lines of business;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans, or advances; and\n\u2022\nengage in consolidations, mergers, liquidations, or dissolutions.\nThese covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, to meet our capital needs, or to otherwise engage in transactions that might be considered beneficial to us.\nIf certain events of default occur under our Credit Agreement, our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. An acceleration of indebtedness under our Credit Agreement may also result in an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes. Additionally, if a change of control as defined in our Credit Agreement were to occur, the lenders under our credit facilities would have the right to require us to repay all of our outstanding obligations under the facilities.\nIf a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the Notes were to occur, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert their Notes during specified periods of time at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, we may be required to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIf any of the events described in the foregoing paragraphs were to occur, in order to satisfy our obligations we may be forced to seek an amendment of and/or waiver under our debt agreements, raise additional capital through securities offerings, asset sales, or other transactions, or seek to refinance or restructure our debt. In such a case, there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate such a transaction on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe consider other financing and refinancing options from time to time, however, we cannot assure you that such options will be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. If one or more rating agencies were to downgrade our credit ratings, that could also impede our ability to refinance our existing debt or secure new debt, increase our future cost of borrowing, and create third-party concerns about our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent misstatements and material weaknesses or deficiencies could arise in the future which could lead to restatements or filing delays.\nOur system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement. An evaluation of effectiveness is subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures decreases over time, or because of unanticipated circumstances or other factors. As a result, although our management has concluded that our internal controls are effective as of January 31, 2016, we cannot assure you that our internal controls will prevent or detect every misstatement, that material weaknesses or other deficiencies will not occur or be identified in the future, that this or future financial reports will not contain material misstatements or omissions, that future restatements will not be required, or that we will be able to timely comply with our reporting obligations in the future.\nThe prices of our common stock and the Notes have been, and may continue to be, volatile and your investment could lose value.\nThe prices of our common stock and the Notes have been, and may continue to be, volatile. Those prices could be affected by any of the risk factors discussed in this Item. In addition, other factors that could impact the prices of our common stock and/or the Notes include:\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors regarding, among other things, strategic changes, new products, product enhancements or technological advances, acquisitions, major transactions, stock repurchases, or management changes;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press and the analyst community, including with respect to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates or growth rates by financial analysts, changes in investors' or analysts' valuation measures for our securities, our credit ratings, or market trends unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nstock sales by our directors, officers, or other significant holders, or stock repurchases by us;\n\u2022\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity by third parties, including by the counterparties to the note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes; and\n\u2022\ndilution that may occur upon any conversion of the Notes.\nA significant drop in the price of our common stock or the Notes could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 89397, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "VRNT"}
