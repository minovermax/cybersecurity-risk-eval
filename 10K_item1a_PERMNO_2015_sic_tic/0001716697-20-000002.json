RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information on the risks we face and our Management of risk contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other SEC filings, the following are material risks which may affect us. Events or circumstances arising from one or more of these risks could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and prospects-and the value and price of our common stock could decline. The risks identified below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all risks we face, and additional risks that we may currently view as not material may also impair our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nReaders and prospective investors in our securities should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nMARKET RISKS\nDifficult economic and market conditions may adversely affect our industry.\nOur financial performance, and the ability of borrowers to pay interest on, and repay the principal of, outstanding loans and the value of the collateral securing those loans is highly dependent upon the business and economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the United States as a whole. Economic pressures on consumers and businesses may adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price. In particular, our banking operations are concentrated primarily in Southern California. Deterioration of economic conditions in Southern California could impair the ability of our borrowers to service their loans, decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers, and erode the value of loan collateral. These conditions could increase the amount of our non-performing assets and have an adverse effect on our efforts to collect our non-performing loans or otherwise liquidate our non-performing assets (including other real estate owned) on terms favorable to us, if at all. These conditions could also cause a decline in demand for our products and services, a lack of growth, or a decrease in deposits, any of which may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital, and hurt our business.\nThe effects of widespread public health emergencies such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\"), has negatively affected the U.S. economy and will likely negatively affect our local economies and may disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWidespread health emergencies, such as the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China, U.S. and other countries, may disrupt our operations through their impact on our employees, customers and their businesses, and certain industries in which our customers operate. Disruptions to our customers may impair their ability to fulfill their obligations to the Company and result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, declining collateral values associated with our existing loans, and losses on our loans. Further, the spread of the outbreak has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and may likely disrupt banking and other financial activity in the areas in which the Company operates. This would likely result in a decline in demand for our products and services, including loans and deposits which would negatively impact our liquidity position and our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and fluctuations in interest rates which could reduce our net interest income and adversely affect our business.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target rate three times in 2019 and increased the federal funds target rate four times in 2018. A substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential, or \u201cspread,\u201d between the interest earned on loans, investment securities, and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate risk inherent in our lending, investing, and deposit-taking activities is a material market risk to us and our business. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by fluctuations in interest rates. The magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates, events over which we have no control, may have an adverse effect on net interest income. The recent Federal Reserve's decision to lower the federal funds target rate may decrease our yields on loans and other interest earning assets. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels, which are also impacted by the decreases in interest rates, can materially affect our assets and liabilities. On the contrary, increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our floating rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations, which could in turn lead to an increase in non-performing assets and net charge-offs.\nGenerally, the interest rates on our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not change at the same rate, to the same extent, or on the same basis. Even assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods of re-pricing may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans, may have features such as floors that limit changes in interest rates on a short-term basis.\nWe seek to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates by structuring our asset-liability composition to obtain the maximum spread. We use interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to assist us in managing asset-liability composition. However, such management tools have inherent limitations that may impair their effectiveness.\nThe replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect our revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.\nLIBOR and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, in May 2018 a group of selected large banks, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee or ARRC, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish the Secured Overnight Finance Rate, or SOFR, as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, given the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. Furthermore, the Bank of England has commenced publication of a reformed Sterling Overnight Index Average or SONIA, comprised of a broader set of overnight Sterling money market transactions, as of April 23, 2018. The SONIA has been recommended as the alternative to Sterling LIBOR by the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR and SONIA will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR or SONIA, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with, our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally\n\u2022\nadversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally\n\u2022\nprompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect to our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate\n\u2022\nresult in disputes, litigation, or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities\n\u2022\nrequire the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as SOFR or reformed SONIA\nAlthough the manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain, because the Company does not have a material amount of LIBOR-based products and our credit documentation provides for the flexibility to move to alternative reference rates, our Management does not believe that the discontinuation of LIBOR will have any material adverse impact on the Company.\nDisruptions in the real estate market could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWhile overall the U.S. economy has experienced a prolonged low interest rate environment, the Southern California real estate market has recovered from what had been a substantial decline during the prior recession. On December 31, 2019, 43.3% and 18.1% of our total loans were comprised of commercial real estate and construction loans, respectively. Of the\ncommercial real estate loans, 30.8% was non-owner-occupied. Because a significant portion of our loans are secured by real estate, any new downturn in the real estate market could materially and adversely affect our business. Our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and we would likely experience greater exposure to risk of loss on loans.\nThe financial condition of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nGENERAL BUSINESS RISKS\nOur clients could move their money to alternative investments causing us to lose a lower cost source of funding.\nDemand deposits can decrease when clients perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. Technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts offered by other out-of-area financial institutions or non-bank service providers. Additionally, customers may withdraw deposits to utilize them to fund business expansion or equity investment. Moreover, should interest rates rise, this may impact our ability to maintain our current noninterest-bearing deposits percentage to total deposits (47.7% of total deposits at December 31, 2019). When clients move money out of Bank demand deposits, particularly noninterest-bearing deposits, we lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income.\nSeveral rating agencies publish unsolicited ratings of the financial performance and relative financial health of many banks, including our Bank, based on publicly available data. As these ratings are publicly available, a decline in our ratings may result in deposit outflows or the inability of our Bank to raise deposits in the secondary market as broker-dealers and depositors may use such ratings in deciding where to deposit their funds.\nCapital and liquidity standards recently adopted by U.S. banking regulators now require banks and bank holding companies to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.\nNew capital standards, both as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the new U.S. Basel III-based capital rules have had a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies. The new capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity.\nThe need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required, and the increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in being required to take steps to increase our regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets\u2019 underlying risks.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard for recognizing current expected credit losses, commonly referred to as CECL. CECL will result in earlier recognition of credit losses and requires consideration of not only past and current events but also reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we will be required to comply with the new standard on January 1, 2023. Our implementation of CECL will likely affect our\nretained earnings, deferred tax assets and allowance for loan losses and, as a result, our regulatory capital ratios. In December 2018, the regulatory agencies approved a final rule that provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. CECL implementation poses operational risk, including the failure to properly transition internal processes or systems, which could lead to errors, financial misstatements, or operational losses.\nWe have liquidity risk.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will have insufficient cash or access to cash to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. We mitigate liquidity risk by establishing and accessing lines of credit with various financial institutions and having back-up access to the brokered deposit markets. Results of operations could be affected if we were unable to satisfy current or future financial obligations. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nOur controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented.\nOur Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls, procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business, and consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. We have also experienced an increase in malicious attempts, although, to our knowledge, none of these attempts have resulted in any material loss. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on our networks and systems, and certain of our third-party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches, and to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence. Breaches of information security also may occur, and in infrequent cases have occurred, through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, including employees. Furthermore, our cardholders use their debit and commercial credit cards to make purchases from third parties or through third-party processing services. As such, we are subject to risk from data breaches of such third party\u2019s information systems or their payment processors. Such a data security breach could compromise our account information. We may suffer losses associated with such fraudulent transactions, as well as for other costs related to data security breaches.\nIn addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems), or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes, and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients, and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability-any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nMore generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Such publicity may also cause damage to our reputation as a financial institution. As a result, our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services. Fear of security breaches (including cybersecurity breaches) could limit the growth of our technology-driven products and services.\nWe offer various internet-based services to our clients, including mobile and online banking services either directly or through an arrangement with a service bureau or third party. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is essential to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence in our mobile and online services. In certain cases, we are responsible for protecting customers\u2019 proprietary information as well as their accounts with us. We have security measures and processes in place to defend against these cybersecurity risks but these cyber-attacks are rapidly evolving (including computer viruses, malicious code, phishing or other information security breaches), and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks, which could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect client transaction data. In addition, individuals, groups or sovereign countries may seek to intentionally disrupt our online banking services or compromise the confidentiality of customer information with criminal intent. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to recognize and assist in preventing security breaches (and periodically test our security), failure to protect against or mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our technology-driven products and services, constitute a breach of privacy or other laws, result in costly litigation and loss of customer relationships, negatively impact our reputation, and could have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations. The Company holds various insurance policies including cybersecurity insurance, however we may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of breaches and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from breaches of security. We may also incur substantial increases in costs in an effort to minimize or mitigate cyber security risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors, and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable, illegal, or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place that seek to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors, and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues, and increased governmental regulation.\nWe rely on communications, information, operating, and financial control systems technology from third-party service providers.\nWe rely heavily on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating, and financial control systems technology, including customer relationship management, internet banking, website, general ledger, deposit, loan servicing, and wire origination systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management, internet banking, website, general ledger, deposit, loan servicing, and/or wire origination systems. We cannot assure you that such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third-party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. If any of our third-party service providers experience financial,\noperational, or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to locate alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the bank regulatory agencies expect financial institutions to be responsible for all aspects of our vendors\u2019 performance, including aspects which they delegate to third parties. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems, or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nWe may experience losses related to fraud, theft, or violence.\nWe may experience losses incurred due to customer or employee fraud, theft, or physical violence. Additionally, physical violence may negatively affect our key personnel, facilities, or systems. These losses may be material and negatively affect our consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, or prospects. These losses could also lead to significant reputational risks and other effects. The sophistication of external fraud actors continues to increase, and in some cases includes large criminal rings, which increases the resources and infrastructure needed to thwart these attacks. The industry fraud threat continues to evolve, including but not limited to card fraud, check fraud, social engineering, and phishing attacks for identity theft and account takeover. We continue to invest in fraud prevention in the forms of people and systems designed to prevent, detect, and mitigate the customer and financial impacts.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success.\nOur employees are our most important resource. Competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the banking industry is intense, which means the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. We endeavor to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. Our senior management team has significant industry experience, and their knowledge and relationships would be difficult to replace. In addition, we continue to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the growth and successful operation of our business. If for any reason we are unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, to attract and retain personnel with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, we may offer a variety of benefits, which could reduce our earnings or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCREDIT RISKS\nDeteriorating credit quality has adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely impact us in the future.\nWhen we lend money or commit to lend money, we incur credit risk or the risk of loss if borrowers do not repay their loans or other credit obligations. The performance of these loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more customers may have difficulty in repaying their credit obligations, which could result in a higher level of loan losses and allowance for loan losses (\"ALLL\"). We reserve for loan losses by establishing reserves through a charge to earnings. The amount of these reserves is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolios including unfunded credit commitments. The process for determining the amount of the ALLL, and the reserve for unfunded commitments is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about the environment, including analysis of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\nOur Management might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our portfolios and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might increase the reserve because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices or higher unemployment, or other factors such as changes in borrower\u2019s behavior or changing protections in credit agreements. As an example, borrowers may \u201cstrategically default,\u201d or discontinue making payments on their real estate-secured loans if the value of the real estate is less than what they owe, even if they are still financially able to make the payments. We believe that both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments are adequate to cover incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded commitments at December 31, 2019; however, there is no assurance that they will be sufficient to cover future loan losses, especially if the commercial real estate market and employment conditions experience a decline. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, we may be required to increase reserves in future periods,\nwhich would reduce earnings. For more information, refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Potential Problem Loans.\nOur allowance for loan loss may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nWe maintain an ALLL on loans, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents Management\u2019s best estimate of risk of losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance reflects Management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; historical loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political, and regulatory conditions, and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the ALLL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires our Management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes.\nDeterioration in economic conditions affecting our borrowers and collateral, new information regarding existing loans, identification of problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the ALLL. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ALLL and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our Management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALLL, we will need additional provisions to increase the ALLL. Any increases in the ALLL will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Allowance for Loan Loss for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the ALLL.\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio despite our underwriting practices.\nWe mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to sound and proven underwriting practices, managed by experienced and knowledgeable credit professionals. These practices include analysis of a borrower\u2019s prior credit history, financial statements, tax returns, cash flow projections, valuations of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers, and verifications of liquid assets. Although we believe that our underwriting criteria is appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make, we may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our ALLL.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, or other climate change-related matters could significantly affect our business.\nOur primary market is located in an earthquake-prone zone in Southern California, which is also subject to other weather or disasters, such as severe wildfire, earthquakes, drought, or flood. These events could unexpectedly interrupt our business operations. Climate-related physical changes and hazards could also pose credit risks for us. For example, some of our borrowers have collateral properties or operations located in coastal areas at risk to rising sea levels and erosion or subject to the risk of wildfires. The properties pledged as collateral on our loan portfolio could also be damaged by tsunamis, landslides, floods, earthquakes, or droughts, and thereby the recoverability of loans could be impaired. A number of factors can affect credit losses, including the extent of damage to the collateral, the extent of damage not covered by insurance, the extent to which unemployment and other economic conditions caused by the natural disaster adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, and the cost of collection and foreclosure to us. Lastly, there could be increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in the availability of coverage, due to severe weather-related losses. The ultimate outcome on our business of a natural disaster, whether or not caused by climate change, is difficult to predict.\nWe have a concentration in loans secured by commercial real estate which could make us vulnerable to changes in the commercial real estate market.\nOur concentration in loans secured by commercial real estate (including owner-occupied nonresidential properties, other nonresidential properties, construction, land development and other land, and multifamily residential properties) has decreased slightly from 446% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2018 to 441% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2019. While our risk management practices are designed to closely monitor these loans as well as the market conditions, and analyze the impact of various stress scenarios on these loans, it is possible that an adverse change in the Southern California commercial real estate market could result in credit losses or the need to increase reserves or capital costs which could have a negative impact on our income, capital, prospects, or reputation.\nThe repayment of our income property loans, consisting of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers.\nWe originate non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties. Repayment of these loans is often dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions.\nFor example, if the cash flow from the borrower\u2019s project is reduced as a result of the financial impairment of a lessee who cannot pay the rent, or as a result of leases not being obtained or renewed in a timely manner or at all, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans also expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, many of our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either refinance or sell the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment.\nIf we foreclose on a non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral may be longer than for residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral and, therefore, our carrying cost for foreclosed non-owner occupied commercial real estate may be materially greater than for residential mortgage loans. Additionally, commercial real estate loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis. As of December 31, 2019, our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $423.8 million or 30.8% of our total loans held for investment, net of discounts.\nReal estate construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate, and we may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects.\nThe risks inherent in real estate construction loans may adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations. Such risks include, among other things, (i) the possibility that contractors may fail to complete, or complete on an untimely basis, construction of the relevant properties; (ii) substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing are incurred; (iii) market deterioration occurs during construction; and (iv) a lack of permanent take-out financing arises. Loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because they have no operating history. The costs may exceed a project's realizable value in a declining real estate market and such properties may not be sold or leased so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by the borrower. Real estate construction loans, including land development loans, comprised approximately 18.1% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019.\nBecause of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, we may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while we attempt to dispose of it. A general decline in real estate sales and prices across the United States or locally in the relevant real estate market, a decline in demand for commercial real estate loans, economic weakness, high rates of unemployment, and reduced availability of mortgage credit, are some of the factors that can adversely affect the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their obligations to us and the value of our security interest in collateral, and thereby adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nSupervisory guidance on commercial real estate concentrations could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limits on the conduct of our business.\nThe Federal Regulatory Agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending intended to help ensure that institutions pursuing a significant commercial real estate lending strategy remain healthy and profitable while continuing to serve the credit needs of their communities. There have been\nconcerns about commercial real estate lending and underwriting expressed by the agencies along with historical concerns that rising commercial real estate loan concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in commercial real estate markets. Existing guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending by providing supervisory criteria, including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny. The guidance does not limit banks\u2019 commercial real estate lending, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. Our lending and risk management practices will be taken into account in supervisory evaluation of capital adequacy. The regulatory definition of a commercial real estate concentration excludes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, but includes unsecured commercial and industrial loans for the purpose of real estate that are not secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2019, our commercial real estate concentration exceeded the regulatory guideline (as defined by the federal bank regulators) of 300% of total risk-based capital and exceeded 50% growth of our commercial real estate related loans over the past 36 months due primarily to the PCB acquisition. Our internal policy is to limit our commercial real estate concentration to 350% of total risk-based capital. Our commercial real estate concentration, as defined by regulatory guidance, was 314% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2019, as compared to 309% at December 31, 2018. In addition, the federal bank regulators established a guideline of 100% of total risk-based capital for loans secured by commercial real estate construction and land development loans. Our internal policy is to limit these loans to 150% of total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, total loans secured by commercial real estate under construction and land development represented 125% and 108% of total risk-based capital. If our risk management practices with regard to this portion of our portfolio are found to be deficient, it could result in increased reserves and capital costs or a need to reduce this type of lending which could negatively impact earnings.\nRepayment of our commercial and industrial loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may not be sufficient to repay the loan in the event of default.\nWe make our commercial and industrial loans primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Collateral securing commercial and industrial loans are generally the working assets of a business that fluctuate in value, may depreciate over time, and could be difficult to appraise. For example, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrowers to collect the amounts due from their customers, and for loans secured by inventory, the sale or liquidation of the inventory may be dependent not only on the quality of the inventory but also on finding a willing buyer. As of December 31, 2019, our commercial and industrial loans totaled $309.0 million, or 22.5% of our total loans.\nREGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS\nWe are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations and litigation, regulatory or other enforcement proceedings by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse consequences.\nWe are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies, regarding our customers and businesses, as well as our sales practices, data security, product offerings, compensation practices, and other compliance issues. In addition, the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S. means that a single event or topic may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings which may result in material adverse consequences. These potential consequences include without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of our SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, responding to information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations, and proceedings, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter, could be time-consuming and expensive.\nLike other financial institutions and companies, we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or other enforcement action against our Company could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and/or cause significant reputational harm to our business. The outcome of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate. Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss from the legal proceedings in\nquestion. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and actual settlements or penalties. For further information on specific legal and regulatory proceedings, please refer to Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\nSignificant changes in banking laws or regulations and federal monetary policy could materially affect our business.\nThe banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and significant new laws and regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws and regulations may cause results to differ materially. Also, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affects our credit conditions, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the discount rate for member bank borrowing, and bank reserve requirements. A material change in these conditions would affect our results. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. For further discussion of the regulation of financial services, please refer to Part I, Item 1 - Business - Regulation and Supervision.\nWe may incur fines, penalties, and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, which are possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective. We may incur fines, penalties, and other negative consequences from regulatory violations. We may suffer other negative consequences resulting from findings of noncompliance with laws and regulations, which may also damage our reputation, and this in turn might materially affect our business and results of operations.\nFor example, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. In addition, the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, imposes upon the Bank a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of our entire community, and requires our federal banking regulators to evaluate the Bank\u2019s record in meeting the credit needs of our communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and to take that record into account in their evaluation of certain regulatory applications, such as applications for mergers, consolidations and acquisitions or the Bank\u2019s engagement in certain activities pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the \u201cGLB\u201d). An unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denying such application. Accordingly, a determination that our policies, procedures and systems are deficient under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 or our record of meeting the credit needs of our entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, is less than satisfactory could materially limit our ability to, or otherwise prevent us from, engaging in any expansion activities or any other activities contemplated in our strategic plan.\nFurther, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional, and even though systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance were in place at the time.\nWe are subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations as well as contractual privacy and data protection obligations. Our failure to comply with these or any future laws, regulations, or obligations could subject us to sanctions and damages, and could harm our reputation and business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various federal government agencies and state and local agencies. We collect personally identifiable information and other data from our current and prospective customers in the course of offering and/or providing financial products, services, and our employees. Self-regulatory obligations, other industry standards, policies, and other legal obligations may apply to our collection, distribution, use, security, or storage of personally identifiable information or other data relating to individuals. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with one another, other regulatory requirements, or our internal practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, industry standards, or legal obligations-or any security incident resulting in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release, or transfer of, personally identifiable information or other data relating to our customers, employees, and others may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines, and penalties or adverse publicity that could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe expect there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security. We cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. In particular, California\u2019s recently enacted privacy law (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) gives consumers significant rights over the use of their personal information and provides a private right of action for security breaches. Any new laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards, or any changed interpretation of existing laws, regulations, or other standards may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. For example, many jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach could result in negative publicity to us, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures and could impact our operating results.\nLiabilities from environmental regulations could materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated financial condition.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. The Bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of any contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages, and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nSTRATEGY RISKS\nOur growth will be inhibited if we cannot attract deposits and quality loans.\nOur ability to increase our asset base depends in large part on our ability to attract additional deposits at favorable rates. We seek additional deposits by providing outstanding customer service and offering deposit products that are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our markets. In addition, our income depends in large part in attracting quality loan customers and loans in which to invest the deposits.\nWe have a continuing need to adapt to technological changes.\nThe banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology allows us to potentially serve our customers better, increase our operating efficiency by reducing operating costs, provide a wider range of products and services to our customers, and potentially attract new customers. Our future success will partially depend upon our ability to successfully leverage technology to provide products and services that will satisfy our customers\u2019 demands for convenience, as well as to create additional operating efficiencies while still maintaining appropriate fraud and cyber-security controls. Our larger competitors already have existing infrastructures or substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We generally arrange for such services through service bureau arrangements or other arrangements with third parties.\nSBA lending is subject to government funding, which can be limited or uncertain.\nThe Bank engages in SBA lending through programs designed by the federal government to assist the small business community in obtaining financing from financial institutions that are given government guarantees as an incentive to make the loans. SBA lending is subject to federal legislation that can affect the availability and funding of the program. From time to time, this dependence on legislative funding causes limitations and uncertainties with regard to the continued funding of such programs, which could potentially have an adverse financial impact on our business.\nWe compete against larger banks and other institutions.\nWe face substantial competition for deposits and loans in our marketplace. Competition for deposits primarily comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, thrift and loan associations, money market and mutual funds, and other investment alternatives. Competition for loans comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, thrift and loan associations, and other financial intermediaries. Our larger competitors, by virtue of their larger capital resources, have substantially greater lending limits than we have. They also provide certain services for their customers, including trust, wealth management, and international banking, which we only are able to offer indirectly through our\ncorrespondent relationships. In addition, they have greater resources and are able to offer longer maturities and on occasion, lower rates on fixed rate loans as well as more aggressive underwriting.\nThere is risk related to acquisitions.\nWe have engaged in expansion through the acquisitions of Pacific Commerce Bank in 2018 and may consider acquisitions in the future, subject to regulatory approval. We cannot predict the frequency, size, or timing of any future acquisitions, and we typically do not comment publicly on a possible acquisition until we have signed a definitive agreement. There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions, if any, will have the anticipated positive results.\nThere are risks associated with any such expansion, including, among others, incorrectly assessing the asset quality of a target, encountering greater than anticipated costs in integrating acquired businesses, facing resistance from customers or employees, being unable to profitably deploy assets acquired in the transaction, or litigation resulting from circumstances occurring at the acquired entity prior to the date of acquisition or resulting from the acquisition. Our earnings, consolidated financial condition, and prospects after a merger or acquisition depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company. We may be unable to integrate operations successfully or to achieve expected cost savings. Any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings.\nAcquisitions involve inherent uncertainty and we cannot determine all potential events, facts, and circumstances that could result in loss or give assurances that our investigation or mitigation efforts will be sufficient to protect against any such loss.\nIssuing additional shares of our common stock to acquire other banks and bank holding companies may result in dilution for existing shareholders and may adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nIn connection with our growth strategy, we have issued, and may issue in the future, shares of our common stock to acquire additional banks or bank holding companies that may complement our organizational structure. Resales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market and the potential of such sales could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. We usually must pay an acquisition premium above the fair market value of acquired assets for the acquisition of banks or bank holding companies. Paying this acquisition premium, in addition to the dilutive effect of issuing additional shares, may also adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nImpairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets associated with acquisitions would result in a charge to earnings.\nGoodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is reviewed at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. If our estimates of goodwill fair value change, we may determine that impairment charges are necessary. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment and concluded there was no impairment at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOur decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be different than initially estimated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and future prospects.\nWe acquired portfolios of loans in the Pacific Commerce Bank acquisition. Although these loans were marked to their estimated fair value pursuant to ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations, there is no assurance that the acquired loans will not suffer further deterioration in value resulting in charge-offs. The fluctuations in national, regional, and local economic conditions may increase the level of charge-offs in the loan portfolios that we acquired from Pacific Commerce Bank and correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled, and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and consolidated financial condition, even if other favorable events occur.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to: not being required to have our internal control over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and exemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and to obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. To the extent we take advantage of any of these reduced reporting burdens in this Annual Report and future filings, the information that we provide our security holders may be different than you might get from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, however, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nOur accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. They require Management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nAccounting policies and processes are fundamental to how we record and report our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require Management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including the allowance for loan losses, valuation of acquired loans, the valuation of goodwill and core deposit intangible and the valuation of deferred tax assets, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require Management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. We have established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are controlled and applied consistently. Because of the uncertainty surrounding our judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust our accounting policies. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations could positively or adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may not be predictable. Among the factors that could affect our stock price, certain of which are beyond our control, are:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations\n\u2022\npublication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates\n\u2022\nfailure to continue our common stock repurchase program\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings\n\u2022\nactions by institutional shareholders\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry\n\u2022\npolitical events, elections, or changes in government or administration\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments\n\u2022\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involve or affect us\n\u2022\ndeletion from a well-known index\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, may experience significant volatility based on its history. As a result, the market price of our common stock may change unpredictably. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur. The trading price of the shares of our common stock and the value of our other securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, our consolidated financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, future sales of our equity or equity related securities, and other factors identified in the \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.\nThere are also various regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to our holding company, in particular, federal and state banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank without prior approval.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires federal banking agencies to establish more stringent risk-based capital guidelines and leverage limits applicable to banks and bank holding companies. The final Basel III capital standards issued in 2013 by the Federal Reserve provide that distributions (including dividend payments and redemptions) on additional Tier 1 capital instruments may only be paid out of net income, retained earnings, or surplus related to other additional Tier 1 capital instruments. The final Basel III capital standards also introduced a new capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. Failure to maintain a capital conservation buffer above certain levels will result in restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock, make dividend payments, redemptions, or other capital distributions. These requirements, and any other new regulations or capital distribution constraints, could adversely affect the ability of our Bank to pay dividends to our holding company and, in turn, affect our holding company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. In addition, the Federal Reserve may also, as a supervisory matter, otherwise limit our holding company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we are electing to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio, or CBLR, framework, beginning with our regulatory report to be filed for the first quarter of 2020, the minimum 9% leverage ratio used to assess compliance with the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rules already incorporate a capital conservation buffer. Accordingly, failure to maintain the minimum 9% leverage ratio under the CBLR framework will result in our Bank having to comply with the generally applicable capital rules, including the capital conservation buffer requirements thereof at which time, the failure to maintain this capital conservation buffer above certain levels will result in restrictions on our ability to make dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock.\nIn addition, our common stock may be fully subordinate to interests held by the U.S. government in the event of a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding, including a proceeding under the \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nWe may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock.\nPayment of stock or cash dividends on our common stock depends on a multitude of factors, including but not limited to: (a) our holding company may not have sufficient earnings since our primary source of income, the payment of dividends to it by our Bank, is subject to federal and state laws that limit the ability of our Bank to pay dividends; (b) Federal Reserve policy requires bank holding companies to pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available\nover the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and consolidated financial condition; or (c) our Board of Directors may determine that, even though funds are available for dividend payments, retaining the funds for internal uses, such as expansion of our operations, is a better strategy. If we fail to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an investment in our common stock. In addition, in the event our Bank becomes unable to pay dividends to our holding company, our holding company may not be able to service our debt, pay our other obligations, continue repurchasing our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, our holding company\u2019s inability to receive dividends from our Bank could also have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and the value of our common stock.\nOur stock trading volume may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.\nAlthough shares of our common stock are listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market, the average daily trading volume in the common stock varies and may be less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the daily average trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of the common stock in a brief period of time,-or the expectation of these sales-could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17798, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCBP"}
