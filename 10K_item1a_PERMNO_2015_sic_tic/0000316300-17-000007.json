{"cik": "316300", "company": "EXCO RESOURCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks identified in \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d describe examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nIf one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOil and natural gas prices, which are subject to fluctuations, have declined substantially from historical highs and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. The depression in oil and natural gas prices has, and is expected to continue to, adversely affect our revenues as well as our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, repay current or future indebtedness and obtain additional capital on attractive terms.\nOur future financial condition, access to capital, cash flow and results of operations depend upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas. We are particularly dependent on prices for natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions and events in other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including embargoes, hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns, and acts of terrorism or sabotage;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the OPEC;\n\u2022\ndomestic government regulation, legislation and policies;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels and other energy sources; and\n\u2022\noverall economic conditions.\nOil and natural gas prices declined sharply during the latter half of 2014 and continued to decline throughout 2015 and into 2016. Although oil and natural gas prices rose throughout the majority of 2016, prices of oil and natural gas have historically been extremely volatile and we expect this volatility to continue. Oil and natural gas prices in 2017 have begun to recover compared to their levels in 2015 and 2016; however, they may never return to historical highs or remain at a level that allows us to economically operate our business.\nDuring 2016, the NYMEX price for natural gas fluctuated from a high of $3.93 per Mmbtu to a low of $1.64 per Mmbtu, while the NYMEX WTI crude oil price ranged from a high of $54.06 per Bbl to a low of $26.21 per Bbl. For the five years ended December 31, 2016, the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from a high of $6.15 per Mmbtu to a low of $1.64 per Mmbtu, while the NYMEX WTI crude oil price ranged from a high of $110.53 per Bbl to a low of $26.21 per Bbl.\nOn December 31, 2016, the spot market price for natural gas at Henry Hub was $3.72 per Mmbtu, a 59% increase from December 31, 2015. On December 31, 2016, the spot market price for crude oil at Cushing was $53.72 per Bbl, a 45% increase from December 31, 2015. For 2016, our average realized prices (before the impact of derivative financial instruments) for oil and natural gas were $38.05 per Bbl and $1.93 per Mcf, respectively, compared with 2015 average realized prices of $43.89 per Bbl and $2.06 per Mcf, respectively.\nOur revenues, cash flow and profitability, as well as our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, to repay current or future indebtedness and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms, depend substantially upon oil and natural gas prices. Compared to earlier years, the lower average prices realized for oil and natural gas in 2016 and 2015, coupled with the slow recovery in financial markets that has significantly limited and increased the cost of capital, have compelled most oil and natural gas producers, including us, to reduce levels of exploration, drilling and production activity. This has had a significant effect on our capital resources, Liquidity and operating results. Any sustained reductions in oil and natural gas prices will directly affect our revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities. Further reductions in oil and natural gas prices could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable. Depressed oil and natural gas prices and reductions in our reserves has had other adverse consequences, including downward redeterminations of the availability of borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. The borrowing base under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is currently set at $150.0 million, and if oil and natural gas prices do not continue to improve, the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement may further reduce our borrowing base which would further restrict our Liquidity. Additionally, further or continued declines in prices could result in additional non-cash charges to earnings due to impairments to our oil and natural gas properties.\nIn light of the depressed commodity price environment, there is risk that, among other things:\n\u2022\nthird parties\u2019 confidence in our commercial or financial ability to explore and produce oil and natural gas could erode, which could impact our ability to execute on our business strategy;\n\u2022\nit may become more difficult to retain, attract or replace key employees;\n\u2022\nemployees could be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other career opportunities; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers, hedge counterparties, vendors and service providers could renegotiate the terms of our arrangements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nThe occurrence of certain of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the differential between NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price used to price our actual oil and natural gas sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe reference or regional index prices that we use to price our oil and natural gas sales sometimes reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we reference in our sales contracts is called a differential. We cannot accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials. Changes in differentials between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price we reference in our sales contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have experienced significant volatility in our price differentials including crude oil production from the Eagle Ford shale and natural gas production from certain areas in Appalachia. Our crude oil production from the Eagle Ford shale is currently sold at a price based on the WTI index plus or minus the differential to indices correlated to the Louisiana Light Sweet index. During 2016, the monthly average of this differential ranged from a high of WTI plus $2.34 per barrel to a low of WTI plus $1.12 per barrel.\nOur natural gas production from the Marcellus shale in Northeast Pennsylvania is sold at a price based on a Platts index that represents value into the Transco Leidy Pipeline. Due to the increased production in this region without an offsetting increase in pipeline capacity or infrastructure to the Northeast United States markets, this differential in 2016 ranged from a low of NYMEX less $0.62 per Mmbtu to a high of NYMEX less $2.08 per Mmbtu. These differentials vary depending on factors such as supply, demand, pipeline capacity, infrastructure and weather.\nWe may encounter obstacles to marketing our oil and natural gas, which could adversely impact our revenues.\nOur ability to market our oil and natural gas production will depend upon the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and other transportation facilities. We are primarily dependent upon third parties to transport our production. Transportation space on the gathering systems and pipelines we utilize is occasionally limited or unavailable due to repairs, outages caused by accidents or other events, or improvements to facilities or due to space being utilized by other companies that have priority transportation agreements. We have experienced production curtailments in our producing regions resulting from capacity restraints, offsetting fracturing stimulation operations and short term shutdowns of certain pipelines for maintenance purposes. As we have increased our knowledge of our shale properties, we have begun to shut in production on adjacent wells when conducting completion operations. Due to the high production capabilities of these wells, these volumes can be significant. Our access to transportation options can also be affected by U.S. federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. These factors and the availability of markets are beyond our control. If market factors dramatically change, the impact on our revenues could be substantial and could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas and the value of our common shares.\nWe have entered into marketing agreements with third parties to sell a significant percentage of our anticipated oil and natural gas production in the East Texas, North Louisiana and South Texas regions. If these third parties are unable or otherwise fail to market the oil and natural gas we produce, we would be required to find alternate means to market our production, which could increase our costs or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may experience a financial loss if any of our significant customers fail to pay us for our oil or natural gas or reduce the volume of oil and natural gas that they purchase from us.\nOur ability to collect payments from the sale of oil and natural gas to our customers depends on the payment ability of our customer base, which includes several significant customers. If any one or more of our significant customers fails to pay us for any reason, we could experience a material loss. We are managing our credit risk as a result of the current commodity price environment through the attainment of financial assurances from certain customers. In addition, if any of our significant customers cease to purchase our oil or natural gas or reduce the volume of the oil or natural gas that they purchase from us, the loss or reduction could have a detrimental effect on our production volumes and may cause a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our oil and natural gas.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments, such as lack of available transportation or infrastructure, may hinder our production or adversely impact our ability to receive market prices for our production or to achieve expected drilling results.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements or infrastructure may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends, in substantial part, on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, processing facilities and oil and condensate trucking operations owned and operated by third-parties. Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil or natural gas pipelines, gathering systems or trucking capacity. A portion of our production may also be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous other reasons, including as a result of accidents, excessive pressures, maintenance, weather, field labor issues or other disruptions of service. Curtailments and disruptions may last from a few days to several months, and we have no control over when or if third-party facilities are restored.\nIn the past we have experienced production curtailments due to infrastructure and market constraints in the Eagle Ford shale formation, which have caused oil production to be shut in and natural gas production to be shut in or flared. Any significant curtailment in gathering, processing or pipeline system capacity, significant delay in the construction of necessary facilities or lack of availability of transportation would interfere with our ability to market our oil and natural gas production, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations.\nWe have entered into significant natural gas firm transportation and marketing agreements primarily in East Texas and North Louisiana that require us to pay fixed amounts of money to the shippers or marketers regardless of quantities actually shipped or marketed. If we are unable to deliver the necessary quantities of natural gas, our results of operations and Liquidity could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into significant natural gas firm transportation contracts primarily in East Texas and North Louisiana that require us to pay fixed amounts of money to the shippers regardless of quantities actually shipped. The use of firm transportation agreements allows us priority space in a shippers\u2019 pipeline. Historically, we have paid significant amounts for the unused portion of these firm transportation agreements and expect to continue incurring significant costs for unused firm transportation in the future.\nWe have entered into an agreement to deliver an aggregate minimum volume commitment of natural gas production from the Holly and Shelby fields to certain gathering systems over a five-year period ending on December 1, 2018. If there is a shortfall to the minimum volume commitment in any year, then we are severally responsible with a joint venture partner to pay fixed amounts of money to the gatherer regardless of quantities actually produced in to the systems. For the twelve months ended December 1, 2016, our net share of the shortfall was $14.1 million.\nIn addition, we have also entered into a marketing agreement with respect to our Haynesville production whereby we are required to deliver a minimum amount of natural gas from the Haynesville shale. We will be required to make material expenditures for these agreements if we fail to deliver the required quantities of natural gas in the future.\nWe anticipate the deliveries of natural gas in future periods will not meet the minimum quantities set forth in certain of these agreements and will require us to make payments for the shortfall below the minimum quantities. In the event the quantities delivered under these arrangements are significantly below the minimum volumes within the agreements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our drilling activity that could impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to develop properties in new or emerging formations may be subject to more uncertainties than drilling in areas that are more developed or have a longer history of established production.\nOur drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. We must incur significant expenditures to identify and acquire properties and to drill and complete wells. Additionally, seismic and other technology does not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or economically producible. The costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, weather conditions and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. We have experienced some delays in contracting for drilling rigs, obtaining fracture stimulation crews and materials, which result in increased costs to drill wells. Also, we may experience issues with the availability of water and sand used in our drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities. All of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations, including our properties in shale formations, are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are developed, have established production or where we have a longer history of operation. Because new or emerging formations have limited or no production history, we are less able to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict future drilling results. Our experience with horizontal drilling in these areas to date, as well as the industry\u2019s drilling and production history, while growing, is limited. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion techniques will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established. We have implemented several initiatives to manage our base production and minimize the decline from our shale properties. If these initiatives are not successful and we are required to incur significant expenditures to manage our base production, this could negatively impact our production and cash flows from operations.\nIf our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, and/or natural gas and oil prices decline, our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate and we could incur material impairments of undeveloped properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on the acreage.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. While we seek to actively manage our leasehold inventory through drilling wells to hold the leasehold acreage that we believe is material to our operations, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint ventures, and our failure to continue such joint ventures or resolve any material disagreements with our partners could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations, our financial condition and our results of operations. Furthermore, the actions taken by other working interest owners could prevent or alter our development plans.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint ventures with third parties, principally Shell. We may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. In many instances we depend on these third parties for elements of these arrangements that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as agreed payments of substantial development costs pertaining to the joint venture and their share of other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third party obligations or the ability of third parties to meet their obligations under these arrangements is outside our control. If these parties do not meet or satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, the performance and success of these arrangements, and their value to us, may be adversely affected. If our current or future joint venture partners are unable to meet their obligations, we may be forced to undertake the obligations ourselves and/or incur additional expenses in order to have some other party perform such obligations. In such cases we may also be required to enforce our rights, which may cause disputes among our joint venture partners and us. If any of these events occur, they may adversely impact us, our financial performance and results of operations, these joint ventures and/or our ability to enter into future joint ventures.\nSuch joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when exploring and developing properties directly, including, for example:\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that our joint venture partners might become insolvent or bankrupt, leaving us liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by our joint venture partners;\n\u2022\njoint venture partners may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives;\n\u2022\ndisputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business;\n\u2022\nthat under certain joint venture arrangements, neither joint venture partner may have the power to control the venture, and an impasse could be reached that might have a negative influence on our investment in the joint venture; and\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners may decide to terminate their relationship with us in any joint venture company or sell their interest in any of these companies and we may be unable to replace such joint venture partner or raise the necessary financing to purchase such joint venture partner\u2019s interest.\nThe failure to continue some of our joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with our joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe owners of working interests may not consent to the development of certain properties that we operate which may require us to assume their share of the working interest during the development and a period after the well is on production. This may require us to expend additional capital not already anticipated as part of our development plans and assume additional risks associated with the development and future performance of the properties. The owners of working interests in certain properties that we operate may also hold rights within the respective operating agreements that could prevent us from performing additional development activities on the properties such as recompletions and other workovers without their consent.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to implement our growth strategy.\nThe growth of our business requires substantial capital on a continuing basis. Due to the amount of debt we have incurred and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness related to the incurrence of additional\nindebtedness, as well as factors related to the depressed commodity price environment, we anticipate that it will be difficult for us in the foreseeable future to obtain additional equity or debt financing or to obtain additional secured financing other than purchase money indebtedness. In addition, the borrowing base under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement has been substantially reduced in recent years and is currently set at $150.0 million. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms and conditions or at all, we may lose opportunities to acquire oil and natural gas properties and businesses and, therefore, be unable to implement our growth strategy.\nWe may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves, which would reduce our revenues and access to capital.\nOur success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are profitable to produce. Factors that may hinder our ability to acquire or develop additional oil and natural gas reserves include competition, access to capital, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and the number and attractiveness of properties for sale. If we are unable to conduct successful development activities or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves, our total Proved Reserves will generally decline as a result of production. Also, our production will generally decline. In addition, if our reserves and production decline, then the amount we are able to borrow under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement will also decline. We may be unable to locate additional reserves, drill economically productive wells or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves.\nAcquisitions, development drilling and exploratory drilling are the main methods of replacing reserves. However, development and exploratory drilling operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons. Our future oil and natural gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. If we fail to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions, our level of production and cash flows will be adversely affected. Throughout 2016 we reduced our development activities and suspended drilling in certain regions, which caused our production to decline and negatively impacted our ability to replace our reserves, which in turn negatively impacted our operating results.\nCompetition in our industry is intense and we may be unable to compete in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and hiring experienced personnel.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have greater financial and technical resources and a larger headcount than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has periodically experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and has caused significant expense/cost increases. We may experience difficulties in obtaining drilling rigs and other services in certain areas as well as an increase in the cost for these services and related material and equipment. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may again occur or how such shortages and price increases will affect our development and exploitation program. The oil and gas industry has recently experienced an increase in demand for drilling and completion services as a result of the improved commodity price environment and more efficient and effective development techniques. The domestic U.S. onshore rig count increased from 375 in May 2016 to 634 in December 2016. Furthermore, oil and gas companies have increased the average amount of proppant utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process to enhance recoveries from the wells. As a result, the increased demand for drilling rigs and proppant could result in increased costs to develop our oil and gas properties.\nCompetition has also been strong in hiring experienced personnel, particularly in petroleum engineering, geoscience, accounting and financial reporting, tax and land professions. In addition, competition is strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, oil and natural gas companies, and undeveloped leases and drilling rights. We are often outbid by competitors in our attempts to acquire properties or companies. All of these challenges could make it more difficult to execute our growth strategy.\nWe may not identify all risks associated with the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, and any indemnification we receive from sellers may be insufficient to protect us from such risks, which may result in unexpected liabilities and costs to us.\nGenerally, it is not feasible for us to review in detail every individual property involved in an acquisition. Any future acquisitions will require an assessment of recoverable reserves, title, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental hazards and liabilities, other liabilities and similar factors. Ordinarily, our review efforts are focused on the higher-valued properties. Even a detailed review of properties and records may not reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well that we acquire. Potential problems, such as deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment or environmental conditions that may require significant remedial expenditures, are not necessarily observable even when we inspect a well. Any unidentified problems from acquisitions could result in material liabilities and costs that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to identify problems with an acquisition, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection or indemnify us against all or part of these problems. Even if a seller agrees to provide indemnification, the indemnification may not be fully enforceable and may be limited by floors and caps on such indemnification.\nWe may not correctly evaluate reserve data or the exploitation potential of properties as we engage in our acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities.\nOur future success will depend on the success of our acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit properties or prospects will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. These decisions could significantly reduce our ability to generate cash needed to service our debt and fund our capital program and other working capital requirements.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of acquisitions with our operations and we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions.\nIntegration of our acquisitions with our business and operations has been a complex, time consuming and costly process. Failure to successfully assimilate our past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\noperating a significantly larger combined organization and adding operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired business, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;\n\u2022\nthe risk that oil and natural gas reserves acquired may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe loss of significant key employees from the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected profitability or growth;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating or consolidating corporate and administrative functions.\nFurther, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\nOur estimates of oil and natural gas reserves involve inherent uncertainty, which could materially affect the quantity and value of our reported reserves, our financial condition and the value of our common shares.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of Proved Reserves, including many factors beyond our control. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains estimates of our Proved Reserves and the PV-10 and Standardized Measure\nof our Proved Reserves. These estimates are based upon reports of our independent petroleum engineers. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC as to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. These estimates should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated Proved Reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. As a result, the estimates are inherently imprecise evaluations of reserve quantities and future net revenue and such estimates prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially.\nOur actual future production, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those we have assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in our assumptions could materially affect the quantity and value of reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our financial condition. In addition, our reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure may be revised downward or upward, based upon production history, results of future exploitation and development activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, decisions and assumptions made by engineers and other factors. A material decline in prices paid for our production can adversely impact the estimated volumes and values of our reserves. Similarly, a decline in market prices for oil or natural gas may adversely affect our PV-10 and Standardized Measure. Any of these negative effects on our reserves or PV-10 and Standardized Measure may negatively affect the value of our common shares.\nContinuing impairments of our asset values could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and net worth.\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Depending upon oil and natural gas prices in the future, and at the end of each quarterly and annual period when we are required to test the carrying value of our assets using full cost accounting rules, we may be required to record an impairment to the value of our oil and natural gas properties if the present value of the after-tax future cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of these properties. We have in the past experienced, and may experience in the future, ceiling test impairments with respect to our oil and natural gas properties.\nOur evaluation of impairment is based upon estimates of Proved Reserves. The value of our Proved Reserves may be lowered in future periods as a result of a decline in prices of oil and natural gas, a downward revision of our oil and natural gas reserves or other factors. As a result, our evaluation of impairment for future periods is subject to uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of Proved Reserves, in projecting the future rates of production and in the timing of development activities. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Because several of these factors are beyond our control, we cannot accurately predict or control the amount of ceiling test impairments in future periods. Future ceiling test impairments could negatively affect our results of operations and net worth.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized impairments of $160.8 million and $1.2 billion to our proved oil and natural gas properties and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we did not recognize any impairments to our proved oil and natural gas properties. We may have additional impairments of our oil and natural gas properties in future periods if the cost of our unamortized proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the limitation under the full cost method of accounting. The possibility and amount of any future impairment is difficult to predict, and will depend, in part, upon future oil and natural gas prices to be utilized in the ceiling test, estimates of proved reserves and future capital expenditures and operating costs.\nWe also test goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. If the book value of our reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge will occur, which would negatively impact our results of operations and net worth. As a result of our testing of goodwill for impairment, we did not record an impairment charge for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nWe are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nOur operations are subject to the risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including the risks of:\n\u2022\nfires, explosions and blowouts;\n\u2022\npipe failures;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental accidents such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, brine or well fluids into the environment (including groundwater contamination).\nWe have in the past experienced some of these events during our drilling, production and midstream operations. These events may result in substantial losses to us from:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nenvironmental clean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigation;\n\u2022\npenalties and suspension of operations; or\n\u2022\nattorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation.\nAs is customary in our industry, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these potential losses or liabilities. Furthermore, insurance coverage may not continue to be available at commercially acceptable premium levels or at all. Due to cost considerations, from time to time we have declined to obtain coverage for certain drilling activities. We do not carry business interruption insurance. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or under-insured events could require us to make large unbudgeted cash expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations.\nOur oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for, production and sale of, oil and natural gas. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Applicable Laws and Regulations.\u201d\nOur business exposes us to liability and extensive regulation on environmental matters, which could result in substantial expenditures and could negatively impact production.\nOur operations are subject to numerous complex U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of materials into the water and air, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Laws, rules and regulations protecting the environment have changed frequently and the changes often include increasingly stringent requirements.\nIn general, the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry has been the subject of increasing scrutiny and regulation by environmental authorities. For example, the EPA has identified environmental compliance by the energy extraction section as one of its enforcement initiatives for fiscal years 2017 - 2019. This initiative was identified during the prior administration and it is unclear whether the new administration will continue with the ongoing initiatives.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations often increases our cost of doing business and, in turn, decreases our profitability. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations as well as associated natural resource damages, or the issuance of injunctive relief. Any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance, and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our earnings, results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Changes to the requirements for drilling, completing, operating, and abandoning wells and related facilities could have similar adverse effects on us.\nIn addition, we could incur substantial expenditures complying with environmental laws and regulations, including future environmental laws and regulations which may be more stringent than those currently in effect. For example, the regulation of GHG emissions by the EPA or by various states in the areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Moreover, the EPA has shown a general increased scrutiny on the oil and gas industry through its regulations under the CAA, SDWA, RCRA, TSCA and CWA.\nThe environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject may, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire us to apply for and receive a permit before drilling commences or certain associated facilities are developed;\n\u2022\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentrations of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and production activities;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other \u201cwaters of the United States,\u201d threatened and endangered species habitats and other protected areas;\n\u2022\nrequire remedial measures to mitigate pollution from current or former operations, such as cleaning up spills, dismantling abandoned facilities, pit closure or plugging abandoned wells;\n\u2022\nrequire additional control and monitoring devices on equipment; and\n\u2022\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nOur operations may be impacted by recent or changing regulatory standards. For example, the EPA recently issued effluent limitation guidelines limiting our ability to dispose of waste water from hydraulic fracturing activities into publicly owned wastewater treatment systems. The EPA and state regulators are also reviewing the practices for the disposal of solid waste in surface impoundments from exploration and production facilities under Subtitle D of RCRA and may continue to refine those requirements. The EPA and state regulators are also expanding National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permitting for storm water discharges at drilling sites. In addition, on May 19, 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the types of chemical mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing fluid which might be reported under the TSCA. This may require more extensive reporting obligations for oil and gas exploration activities that use hydraulic fracturing.\nChanges in regulation can also occur at a state or local level. For example, the State of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection is updating oil and gas regulations which include more stringent permitting requirements, waste handling disposal and water restoration requirements. Some localities, for example in Texas, are enacting water usage restrictions that may impact oil and gas exploration. In addition, some states have considered, and notably California has adopted, a state specific GHG regulatory program that may limit GHG emissions or may require costs in association with the control of GHG emissions.\nThe implementation of climate change regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our oil and natural gas production.\nGHG regulations could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our oil and natural gas production.\nIn the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions. Although the U.S. Supreme Court struck down GHG permitting requirements for GHG as a stand-alone pollutant, it upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to control GHG emissions when a source has to secure a major source permit to control the emissions of other criteria pollutants. These permitting provisions, to the extent applicable to our operations, could require us to implement emission controls or other measures to reduce GHG emissions and we could incur additional costs to satisfy those requirements. Additionally, the EPA established GHG reporting requirements for a broad range of sources, including in the petroleum and natural gas industry, requiring those sources to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions. Although this rule does not limit the amount of GHGs that can be emitted, it requires us to incur costs to monitor record and report GHG emissions associated with our operations.\nAs part of a move to reduce GHG emissions, the EPA has issued new rules limiting methane emissions from new or modified oil and gas sources. The rules amend the air emissions rules for the oil and natural gas sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources to include new standards for methane. Simultaneously with the methane rules, EPA adopted new rules governing the aggregating of multiple surface sites into a single-source of air quality permitting purposes. The grouping together of sources may cause a group of sources to be treated as a \u201cmajor source\u201d and face enhanced regulation under federal environmental laws, including the CAA.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production. Most hydraulic fracturing (other than hydraulic fracturing using diesel) is exempted from regulation under the SDWA. Congress has considered legislation to amend the federal SDWA to remove the exemption from regulation and permitting that is applicable to hydraulic fracturing operations and require reporting and disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Many states have adopted or are considering legislation regulating hydraulic fracturing, including the disclosure of chemicals used in the process. Such bills or similar legislation, if adopted, could increase the possibility of litigation and establish an additional level of regulation that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens, making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing our costs of compliance. At the state and local levels, some jurisdictions have adopted, and others are considering adopting, requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, as well as bans on hydraulic fracturing activities. In the event that new or more stringent state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we have properties, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIn addition, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using diesel under the SDWA\u2019s Underground Injection Control Program (\u201cUIC\u201d) and has issued guidance regarding its authority over the permitting of these activities. Additionally, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d including water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Further, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In 2014, the EPA published an advanced notice of public rulemaking regarding TSCA reporting of the chemical substances and mixture used in hydraulic fracturing. If this assessment results in additional regulatory scrutiny, it could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. Consequently, these studies and initiatives could spur further legislative or regulatory action regarding hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations.\nThese new initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing may increase our cost of disposal and impact our business operations and could cause our hydraulic fracturing activities to become subject to additional permit requirements or operations restrictions which could lead to permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we ultimately are able to produce.\nThe EPA has adopted rules to limit air emissions from oil and gas operations, subjecting oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the NSPS and NESHAPS programs under the CAA. The EPA rules include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. Before January 1, 2015, these standards require owners/operators to reduce VOC emissions from natural gas not sent to the gathering line during well completion either by flaring, using a completion combustion device, or by capturing the natural gas using green completions with a completion combustion device. Beginning January 1, 2015, operators must capture the natural gas and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions. The standards are applicable to newly fractured wells and also existing wells that are refractured. Further, the finalized regulations also establish specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The implementation of these new requirements may result in increased operating and compliance costs, increased regulatory burdens and delays in our operations. There may also be further refinement to existing NSPS standards for VOCs as data is gathered about the implementation of those requirements.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments is subject to risks that our counterparties may default on their contractual obligations to us and may cause us to forego additional future profits or result in us making cash payments.\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into, and may in the future enter into, derivative financial instrument arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. The agreements that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural\ngas production over a fixed period of time. Our derivative financial instruments are subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment. The change in the fair market value of these instruments is reported as a non-cash item in our consolidated statements of operations each quarter, which typically results in significant variability in our net income or loss. Derivative financial instruments expose us to the risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices in some circumstances, including the following:\n\u2022\nmarket prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to receive, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments;\n\u2022\nthere may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative financial instrument agreement and actual prices received; or\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative financial instrument contract may default on its contractual obligations to us.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments could have the effect of reducing our revenues and the value of our securities. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our cash receipts from settlements of our derivative financial instrument contracts totaled $39.1 million and $128.8 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, a $1.00 increase in the average commodity price per Mcfe would have resulted in an increase in cash settlement payments (or a decrease in settlements received) of approximately $60.0 million for oil and natural gas swaps. As of December 31, 2016, our oil and natural gas derivative financial instrument contracts were in the net liability position of $27.7 million. The ultimate settlement amount of these unrealized derivative financial instrument contracts is dependent on future commodity prices. We may incur significant realized and unrealized losses in the future from our use of derivative financial instruments to the extent market prices increase and our derivatives contracts remain in place.\nWe operate in a litigious environment.\nAny constituent could bring suit regarding our existing or planned operations or allege a violation of an existing contract. Any such action could delay when planned operations can actually commence or could cause a halt to existing production until such alleged violations are resolved by the courts. Not only could we incur significant legal and support expenses in defending our rights, but halting existing production or delaying planned operations could impact our future operations and financial condition. In addition, we are defendants in numerous cases involving claims by landowners for surface or subsurface damages arising from our operations and for claims by unleased mineral owners and royalty owners for unpaid or underpaid revenues customary in our business. We incur costs in defending these claims and from time to time must pay damages or other amounts due. Such legal disputes can also distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we terminated our sales and transportation contracts with Enterprise Products Operating LLC (\u201cEnterprise\u201d) and Acadian Gas Pipeline System (\u201cAcadian\u201d), respectively, as a result of Enterprise failing to pay and cure monies owed to EXCO for July 2016 natural gas sales. Enterprise filed an amended petition alleging that we could not terminate the parties\u2019 agreements despite Enterprise's uncured payment default under the gas sales agreement, and further alleged that we were in breach of the firm transportation agreements. On October 17, 2016, we filed a counterclaim asserting that Enterprise was the breaching party because it improperly withheld payment for natural gas we delivered to it and the amounts owed by Enterprise exceeded the amounts owed by us to Acadian. For additional information, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\" and \"Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and natural gas production company, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nThere are inherent limitations in all internal control over financial reporting, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWhile we have taken actions designed to address compliance with the internal control, disclosure control and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC implementing these requirements, there are inherent limitations in our ability to control all circumstances. Our management, including our chief financial officer and chief accounting officer, do not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of our company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe have engaged in transactions with related persons and may do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our shareholders\u2019 best interests.\nWe have engaged in transactions and may continue to engage in transactions with related persons. As described in our filings with the SEC, these transactions include, among others, issuances of securities to affiliates of certain of our directors, strategic consulting services provided to us by an affiliate of a director and the issuance of secured indebtedness by us payable to related parties.\nMost recently, we completed the offering of the 1.5 Lien Notes and the exchange of the Second Lien Term Loans for the 1.75 Lien Term Loans, including the issuance of warrants to (i) the investors of the 1.5 Lien Notes (the \u201cFinancing Warrants\u201d), (ii) certain investors of the 1.5 Lien Notes that agreed to receive warrants in lieu of cash paid for fees (the \u201cCommitment Fee Warrants\u201d), and (iii) certain exchanging holders of the Second Lien Term Loans (the \u201cAmendment Fee Warrants,\u201d and collectively with the Financing Warrants and the Commitment Fee Warrants, the \u201c2017 Warrants\u201d). Certain of our directors have relationships with entities that hold substantial amounts of the 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans and 2017 Warrants, including:\n\u2022\nSamuel Mitchell, a member of our Board of Directors, serves as a Managing Director of Hamblin Watsa Investment Counsel Ltd. (\"Hamblin Watsa\"), the investment manager of Fairfax and certain affiliates thereof, and certain affiliates of Fairfax hold, directly or indirectly, $151.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.5 Lien Notes and $412.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.75 Lien Term Loans, as well as Financing Warrants representing the right to purchase an aggregate of 162,365,599 common shares at an exercise price equal to $0.93 per share, Commitment Fee Warrants representing the right to purchase an aggregate of 6,471,433 common shares at an exercise price equal to $0.01 per share and Amendment Fee Warrants representing the right to purchase an aggregate of 19,412,035 common shares at an exercise price equal to $0.01 per share. Fairfax is also the beneficial owner of approximately 9.9% of our outstanding common shares.\n\u2022\nC. John Wilder, a member of our Board of Directors, serves as the sole manager of Bluescape, the parent of ESAS. ESAS holds $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.5 Lien Notes and $47.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.75 Lien Term Loans, as well as Financing Warrants representing the right to purchase an aggregate of 75,268,818 common shares at an exercise price equal to $0.93 per share. ESAS is also the beneficial owner of approximately 6.6% of our outstanding common shares and the party to our services and investment agreement. ESAS received a consent fee of $1.6 million in cash for exchanging its interest in the Exchanger Term Loan, and a commitment fee of $2.1 million in cash in connection with the issuance of the 1.5 Lien Notes.\n\u2022\nB. James Ford, a member of our Board of Directors, serves as a Senior Adviser of Oaktree. Certain affiliates of Oaktree hold, directly or indirectly, $39.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.5 Lien Notes, Financing Warrants representing the right to purchase an aggregate of 42,473,119 common shares at an exercise price equal to $0.93 per share, and a commitment fee of $1.2 million in cash. Oaktree is also the beneficial owner of approximately 11.0% of our outstanding common shares.\nThese entities may also acquire additional common shares to the extent we make interest payments in our common shares. As a result, there may be an actual or apparent conflict of interest between the duties of these members of our Board of Directors to our company and their duties to Fairfax, ESAS or Oaktree, as applicable, including, among other things, with respect to the fairness of the terms of the offering of the 1.5 Lien Notes, the exchange of the Second Lien Term Loans for 1.75 Lien Term Loans and the issuance of the 2017 Warrants. These transactions were approved by a special committee of the Board of Directors consisting of the sole disinterested member of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, during the pending of review and negotiations of terms, authorized and approved the transactions based on the recommendation of the special committee.\nDespite the approval of the terms of these transactions or any other related party transactions, there can be no assurance that any actual or potential conflicts of interest between the members of our Board of Directors and their related parties will be resolved in a manner that does not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any actual or perceived conflict of interest may have a negative impact on the value of our common shares.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryovers to reduce future tax payments may be limited.\nOur net operating loss and other tax attribute carryovers (\"NOLs\") may be limited if we undergo an ownership change. Generally, an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points looking back over a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use our NOLs to reduce income taxes is limited to an annual amount, or the Section 382 limitation, equal to the fair market value of our common shares immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax-exempt interest rate, which is published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\").\nIn the event of an ownership change, NOLs can be used to offset taxable income for years within a carryforward period subject to the Section 382 limitation. Any excess NOLs that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year will continue to be allowed as carryforwards for the remainder of the carryforward period. Whether or not an ownership change occurs, the carryforward period for NOLs is 20 years from the year in which the losses giving rise to the NOLs were incurred. If the carryforward period for any NOL were to expire before that NOL had been fully utilized, the unused portion of that NOL would be lost. Our use of new NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected by the Section 382 limitation (unless there is another ownership change after the new NOLs arise). NOLs available for utilization as of December 31, 2016 were approximately $2.2 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the cumulative ownership change utilized in the calculation of the Section 382 limitation was approximately 21%. The following transactions have the potential to significantly impact the ownership change in future periods:\n\u2022\nthe payment of interest through the issuance of common shares to certain holders of the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans;\n\u2022\nthe exercise of the 2017 Warrants; and\n\u2022\nthe exercise of warrants issued to ESAS in connection with the services and investment agreement.\nWe cannot predict the timing and extent of issuances of common shares as a result of these transactions, and the agreements governing the 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans and 2017 Warrants contain certain limitations on our ability to issue our common shares as interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans or upon the exercise of the 2017 Warrants. Prior to December 31, 2018, we may elect to make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our common shares in our sole discretion, subject to certain restrictions. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we may be required to make interest payments in cash if we meet certain liquidity thresholds. In addition, the agreements governing the 2017 Warrants contain exercise limitations that limit a holder from exercising a 2017 Warrant if, as a result of such exercise, such warrant holder\u2019s affiliates and any person subject to aggregation with such warrant holder or its affiliates under Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act would beneficially own (as defined in Rules 13d-3 or 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, except that for purposes of this clause, such holder shall be deemed to have \u201cbeneficial ownership\u201d of all shares that any such holder has the right to acquire, whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time), directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the total voting power of the voting capital stock of the Company or any of its direct or indirect parent entities (or their successors by merger, consolidation or purchase of all or substantially all of their assets).\nDespite the limitations contained in these agreements, the issuance of a significant amount of common shares to certain parties as a result of these transactions may result in an ownership change by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling\nthree-year period. If an ownership change occurs and our NOLs are subject to the Section 382 limitation, this could adversely impact our future cash flows if we have taxable income and are not able to offset it through the utilization of our NOLs.\nWe currently have negative shareholders\u2019 equity, which could adversely affect our financial condition and otherwise adversely impact our business and growth prospects.\nWe have recently experienced losses as a result of the recent decline in oil and natural gas prices, and, as of December 31, 2016, we had negative shareholders\u2019 equity of $871.9 million, which means that our total liabilities exceeded our total assets. We may not be able to return to profitability in the near future, or at all, and the continuing existence of negative shareholders\u2019 equity may limit our ability to obtain future debt or equity financing or to pay future dividends or other distributions. If we are unable to obtain financing in the future, it could have a negative effect on our operations and our Liquidity.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements included herein contain disclosures that express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, indicating the possibility that we may not be able to operate in the future.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and other commitments in the normal course of business. Our Liquidity and ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants have been negatively impacted by the prolonged depressed oil and natural gas price environment, levels of indebtedness, and gathering, transportation and certain other commercial contracts. As of December 31, 2016, we had $9.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $46.2 million of availability under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and a working capital deficit of $147.7 million.\nManagement\u2019s plans are intended to mitigate risks related to our ability to continue as a going concern; however, our ability to execute these plans is conditioned upon factors including the shareholder approval to permit the issuance of common shares to pay interest on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans. There is no assurance any such transactions will occur. As a result of the impact of the aforementioned factors on our financial results and condition, we anticipate that we may not be able to comply with the financial covenants under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement for the twelve-month period following the date of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we are not able to comply with our debt covenants or do not have sufficient Liquidity to conduct our business operations in future periods, we may be required, but unable, to refinance all or part of our existing debt, seek covenant relief from our lenders, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, or issue equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and may be required to surrender assets pursuant to the security provisions of the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. Therefore, our ability to continue our planned principal business operations would be dependent on the actions of our lenders or obtaining additional debt and/or equity financing to repay outstanding indebtedness under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See further discussion regarding our ability to continue as a going concern and management's plans to mitigate these conditions as part of \"Note 1. Organization and basis of presentation\" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRisks relating to our indebtedness\nOur ability to make interest payments in our common shares on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans, and our ability to issue the common shares underlying the 2017 Warrants, is subject to our receipt of certain shareholder approvals. If we are unable to obtain these shareholder approvals, we will be subject to interest rate penalties and we may be unable to afford to make interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness or to continue our operations and may be forced into bankruptcy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe recently closed the offering of the 1.5 Lien Notes, the exchange of the Second Lien Term Loans for the 1.75 Lien Term Loans and the issuance of the 2017 Warrants. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the indenture governing the 1.5 Lien Notes and the credit agreement governing the 1.75 Lien Term Loans allow us to elect, at our option through December 31, 2018 and subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria thereafter, to pay interest on the 1.5 Lien Notes and the 1.75 Lien Term Loans by issuing our common shares. Our ability to make these interest payments in our common shares, and to issue the common shares underlying the warrants, is dependent on us obtaining shareholder approval.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of formation currently provides that we are authorized to issue up to 780,000,000 million common shares, of which 282,973,605 were outstanding, 14,293,850 were reserved for issuance under our 2005 Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan, 80,000,000 were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of warrants\nheld by ESAS and 2,365,589 were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, in each case as of December 31, 2016. Accordingly, in order for us to make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our common shares and to issue the common shares underlying the 2017 Warrants, we plan to seek shareholder approval to amend our charter to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance or approval to execute a reverse stock split, without a proportionate reduction in authorized shares.\nOur Liquidity is currently significantly constrained and a principal purpose of offering the 1.5 Lien Notes and exchanging the Second Lien Term Loans for 1.75 Lien Term Loans was to alleviate the substantial cash interest payment burden related to the Second Lien Term Loans by restructuring a portion of our indebtedness to allow interest payments in our common shares. If we are not able to make interest payments in our common shares on the 1.5 Lien Notes and the 1.75 Lien Term Loans, we will be forced to continue to make cash interest payments on our 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes and the Exchange Term Loan, as well as to make cash interest payments or interest payments in additional indebtedness on our 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans. In addition, if we fail to obtain the shareholder approvals described above by the end of the month following the six month anniversary of closing, the cash interest rate on the 1.5 Lien Notes will increase from 8% per annum to 15% per annum and the payment-in-kind interest rate on the 1.5 Lien Notes will increase from 11% per annum to 20% per annum. Based on our estimates, if we are not able to make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our common shares, we are not expected to comply with certain debt covenants under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and our liquidity is not expected to be sufficient to support the interest payments due under our outstanding indebtedness and for us to continue to conduct our business operations on an ongoing basis.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our indebtedness, including holders of the 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes, 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans and remaining holders of the Exchange Term Loan, could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.\nAs of December 31, 2016, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the 1.5 Lien Notes and the exchange of the Second Lien Term Loans for 1.75 Lien Term Loans, we had approximately $1.2 billion of aggregate principal indebtedness, and no indebtedness subject to variable interest rates. Our total cash interest payments on an annual basis, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and assuming we do not face interest rate penalties on the 1.5 Lien Notes related to the failure to receive certain shareholder approvals, based on currently available interest rates would be approximately $127.3 million. If we make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our common shares, our total cash interest payments, based on the same conditions above, would be approximately $18.0 million. In each case, our total interest payments, includes the annual cash payments of $2.2 million on the $17.2 million in aggregate principal amount of our Exchange Term Loan that remains outstanding following the exchange of our Second Lien Term Loans for the 1.75 Lien Term Loans, which is not considered to be interest expense in accordance with GAAP. See \"Note 5. Debt\" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information and the accounting treatment of the Exchange Term Loan.\nOur level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans, Exchange Term Loan, the indenture governing the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes (\"Unsecured Notes Indenture\"), and the agreements governing our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may issue a substantial number of our common shares as payments for the interest due under the 1.5 Lien Notes and the 1.75 Lien Term Loans;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty borrowing money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations;\n\u2022\nthe amount of our interest expense may increase because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nwe will need to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;\n\u2022\nwe may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nwhen oil and natural gas prices decline, our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants becomes more difficult and our borrowing base is subject to reductions, which may reduce or eliminate our ability to fund our operations; and\n\u2022\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will be unable to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. The current low commodity price environment has had a significant, adverse impact on our business, including substantially reduced cash flows from operations due to the decline in oil and natural gas prices and the roll off of our hedging arrangements. While we were not in default under our existing debt instruments at December 31, 2016, our ability to service our debt, including the 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes, 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans and Exchange Term Loan, and fund our operations is at risk in a sustained continuation of the current commodity price environment. In addition, our ability to service our debt is substantially dependent on our ability to make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our common shares, which is in turn dependent on our ability to obtain certain approvals by our shareholders. If we are not able to obtain the shareholder approvals necessary to make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our common shares, we would need some additional form of debt restructuring, capital raising or asset sale in order to fund our operations and meet our substantial debt service obligations. Our management is actively pursuing additional strategies to improve our liquidity and reduce our future debt service obligations, though there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute any of these strategies.\nWe may incur more debt, which may intensify the risks described above, including our ability to service our indebtedness.\nTogether with our subsidiaries, we may incur more debt in the future in connection with our exploration, exploitation, development, acquisitions of undeveloped acreage and producing properties, including issuances of additional 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in lieu of making interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in cash or our common shares. The restrictions in our debt agreements on our incurrence of additional indebtedness are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. To the extent new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness, the risks described above could substantially increase. Significant additions of undeveloped acreage financed with debt may result in increased indebtedness without any corresponding increase in borrowing base, which could curtail drilling and development of this acreage or could cause us to not comply with our debt covenants.\nTo service our indebtedness, fund our planned capital expenditure programs and fund acquisitions, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and other resources in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness to fund planned capital expenditures or to fund our other Liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations and capital expenditure programs, we may be forced to sell assets, issue additional equity or debt securities or restructure our debt. These remedies may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our Liquidity.\nOur borrowing base under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is subject to semi-annual redetermination, with the next scheduled redetermination set to occur in November 2017. The borrowing base redetermination process considers assumptions related to future commodity prices; therefore, our borrowing capacity could be negatively impacted by further declines in oil and natural gas prices. If our borrowing base were to be reduced to a level which was less than the current\nborrowings, we would be required to reduce our borrowings to a level sufficient to cure any deficiency. We may be required to sell assets or seek alternative debt or equity which may not be available at commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes, 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans and Exchange Term Loan could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nRestrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nThe EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the 1.5 Lien Notes, the 1.75 Lien Term Loans and the Exchange Term Loan contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our capital stock;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale or leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into specified investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrepurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates; or\n\u2022\npursue other corporate activities.\nAlso, the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these financial covenants. These financial covenants could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the indenture governing the 1.5 Lien Notes, the credit agreement governing the 1.75 Lien Term Loans and the term loan agreement governing the Exchange Term Loan. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. When oil and/or natural gas prices decline for an extended period of time or when our Liquidity is constrained, our ability to comply with these covenants becomes more difficult. Although we are currently in compliance with these covenants, if oil and gas prices continue to decline, we may default on one or more of these covenants. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and could result in acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies.\nAn event of default under the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the indenture governing the 1.5 Lien Notes, the credit agreement governing the 1.75 Lien Term Loans or the term loan agreement governing the Exchange Term Loan would permit the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event that our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing during general economic, business or industry downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nOur short-term Liquidity is constrained and could severely impact our cash flow and our development of properties.\nCurrently, our principal sources of Liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. On March 15, 2017, our borrowing base under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement was reduced to $150.0 million. In addition, our ability to make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our\ncommon shares is currently subject to the receipt of certain shareholder approvals. If our borrowing base is materially reduced or we are no longer able to draw on the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, or if we are unable to obtain the necessary shareholder approvals to make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our common shares or generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may not be able to fund our operations and drilling activities or pay the interest on our debt, which would result in us defaulting under our various debt instruments and may force us to seek bankruptcy protection or pursue other restructuring alternatives.\nWe may not be able to repurchase or repay our indebtedness upon a change of control.\nIf we experience certain kinds of changes of control, we may be required to offer to repurchase or repay all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, including the 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes, 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans and the Exchange Term Loan. We may not be able to repurchase or repay our indebtedness following a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources or sufficient access to financing.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nEach of our 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes, 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans and Exchange Term Loan currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in the credit ratings of our 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes, 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans or Exchange Term Loan will generally affect the market value of such debt.\nAny future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing and may increase the cost of debt financing. In addition, if any credit rating initially assigned to the 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes, 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans or Exchange Term Loan is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of such notes.\nThe credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nWe have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with our hedges and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is unable to fund its commitment, our Liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender\u2019s commitment under the credit agreement.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Shares\nOur common shareholders may experience significant dilution in the future, particularly if we make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and the 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our common shares or if the 2017 Warrants are exercised.\nWe may in the future issue additional common shares or other securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common shares at prices that may not be the same price as holders of our common shares paid for their shares, including common shares that may be issued as interest payments under the 1.5 Lien Notes and the 1.75 Lien Term Loans, or upon the exercise of the 2017 Warrants, the warrants held by ESAS or our other derivative securities. We are currently authorized to issue up to 780,000,000 common shares and 10,000,000 preferred shares with such designations, preferences and rights as determined by our Board of Directors, and, as described above, we plan to seek shareholder approval to amend our charter to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance or approval to execute a reverse stock split, without a proportionate reduction of authorized shares. The issuance of additional common shares may substantially dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders.\nAs described herein, a principal purpose of offering the 1.5 Lien Notes and exchanging the Second Lien Term Loans for 1.75 Lien Term Loans was to alleviate the substantial cash interest payment burden related to the Second Lien Term Loans by restructuring a portion of our indebtedness to allow interest payments in our common shares.\nThe issuance of our common shares as interest payments under the 1.5 Lien Notes or upon the exercise of the 2017 Warrants will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our existing shareholders and could negatively impact the market price of our common shares. Even if we do not make interest payments in our common shares and the 2017 Warrants are not exercised, the existence of the payment-in-kind interest payment feature of the 1.5 Lien Notes and the 1.75 Lien Term Loans and the 2017 Warrants may depress the price of our common shares. Furthermore, when we elect to make interest payments in our common shares, the number of common shares issued will be dependent on the market price of our common shares. If our common share price decreases, we will have to issue a greater number of common shares to make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans, which in turn could further depress the price of our common shares.\nThe following table depicts EXCO's outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2016 and the warrants issued on March 15, 2017 in connection with the issuance of the 1.5 Lien Notes and recent exchange transactions:\n(1)\nThe exercisability of the warrants within this table are subject to conditions including the receipt of certain shareholder approvals. The amount of actual common shares purchased by the exercise of the Financing Warrants could be significantly lower than the amount depicted in this table depending on the holder's election of either a cash or cashless exercise. The warrants previously issued to ESAS in connection with a services and investment agreement are excluded due to the time and performance based contingencies required for vesting.\n(2)\nThe common shares within this table exclude the potential dilution attributable to the common shares that could be issued to pay interest on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans. If we elect to pay interest on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans solely in common shares, we would issue approximately 242 million common shares on an annual basis assuming a constant share price consistent with the closing price of $0.56 for EXCO's common shares as of February 28, 2017. The amount of shares issued to pay interest on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans may significantly differ from this amount due to factors such as fluctuations in the price of EXCO's common shares, our decisions on the method of interest payments, and limitations on the ability to pay interest in common shares within the indenture governing the 1.5 Lien Notes and credit agreement governing the 1.75 Lien Term Loans.\nThe table above is based on assumptions that may not accurately reflect future conditions and is intended to show the maximum dilutive impact of the issuance of our common shares as interest payments under the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans and upon the exercise of the 2017 Warrants. The ultimate impact of dilution will be substantially dependent on whether and to what extent we elect to make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our common shares and whether the holders of the 2017 Warrants elect to exercise such 2017 Warrants, each of which will depend on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions, available cash and the price per share of our common shares.\nIn connection with the offering of the 1.5 Lien Notes, the exchange of our Second Lien Term Loans for 1.75 Lien Term Loans and the issuance of the 2017 Warrants, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the holders of the 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans and 2017 Warrants. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, we agreed, subject to certain limitations, to register the resale of all of the common shares we may issue as interest payments under the 1.5 Lien Notes and the 1.75 Lien Term Loans, as well as all of the common shares underlying the 2017 Warrants. The sale of these common shares, which represents more than the total number of common shares we currently have outstanding, into the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could substantially reduce the market price of our common shares. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.\nOur common share price may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common shares currently trade on the NYSE but an active trading market for our common shares may not be sustained. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly as a result of:\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of our common shares, including common shares issued as interest payments under the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans or upon exercise of the 2017 Warrants;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to our business or the business of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of public market analysis;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nconditions generally affecting the oil and natural gas industry;\n\u2022\nthe success of our operating strategy; and\n\u2022\nthe operating and share price performance of other comparable companies.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common shares. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE, it may result in a delisting of our common shares from the NYSE.\nOur common shares are currently and have been listed for trading on the NYSE, and the continued listing of our common shares on the NYSE is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. To maintain compliance with these continued listing standards, the Company is required, among other things, to maintain an average closing price of $1.00 or more over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. On January 16, 2017, we received a notice from the NYSE that the average closing price of our common shares over the prior 30 consecutive trading days was below $1.00 per share, and, as a result, the price per share of the common shares was below the minimum average closing price required to maintain listing on the NYSE. The notice stated that we had six months to regain compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards, or until July 16, 2017, or the NYSE would initiate procedures to suspend and delist the common shares. We have notified the NYSE of our intent to cure this noncompliance and are currently exploring options for regaining compliance, including a potential reverse share split. If we effect a reverse share split, the common shares will be deemed to be in compliance with NYSE standards if, promptly after the reverse share split, the price per common share exceeds $1.00 per share and remains above that level for at least the following 30 trading days.\nOur amended and restated certificate of formation permits us to issue preferred shares that may restrict a takeover attempt that you may favor.\nOur amended and restated certificate of formation permits our board to issue up to 10,000,000 preferred shares and to establish by resolution one or more series of preferred shares and the powers, designations, preferences and participating, optional or other special rights of each series of preferred shares. The preferred shares may be issued on terms that are unfavorable to the holders of our common shares, including the grant of superior voting rights, the grant of preferences in favor of preferred shareholders in the payment of dividends and upon our liquidation and the designation of conversion rights that entitle holders of our preferred shares to convert their shares into common shares on terms that are dilutive to holders of our common shares. The issuance of preferred shares in future offerings may make a takeover or change in control more difficult.\nOur amended and restated certificate of formation contains a provision waiving the duty of a member of our Board of Directors to present corporate opportunities to us, which could adversely affect our shareholders.\nPursuant to our services and investment agreement with ESAS, we amended and restated our certificate of formation to provide that C. John Wilder, the Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors, is not required to present corporate opportunities to us. As a result of the waiver, Mr. Wilder and certain of his affiliates have the ability to engage in the same or similar lines of business as us and will not be obligated to, among other things, offer us an opportunity to participate in any business opportunities that involve any aspect of the energy business or industry that are presented or become known to Mr. Wilder and certain of his affiliates. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by Mr. Wilder to himself or his affiliates instead of to us.\nWe have a number of large shareholders that have significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval because of their ownership of our common shares, and the ownership of our common shares may become significantly concentrated in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had two shareholders that, directly or through certain affiliates, each beneficially owned more than 5% of our outstanding common shares, and two shareholders that, directly or through certain affiliates, each beneficially owned more than 10% of our outstanding common shares.\nIn addition, certain affiliates of Fairfax hold, directly or indirectly, $151.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.5 Lien Notes, $412.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.75 Lien Term Loans and 2017 Warrants representing the right to\npurchase 188,249,067 common shares, making such affiliates of Fairfax the largest holder of the 1.5 Lien Notes, 1.75 Lien Term Loans and 2017 Warrants. As a result, if we make interest payments on the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans in our common shares, and Fairfax\u2019s affiliates choose to exercise all or a portion of their 2017 Warrants, the ownership of our common shares could become significantly concentrated in such affiliates of Fairfax. Furthermore, any of these future issuances of common shares to Fairfax\u2019s affiliates would dilute the common share ownership of our public shareholders, further increasing the relative percentage of our outstanding common shares held by Fairfax\u2019s affiliates.\nShareholders and/or their affiliates that have significant beneficial ownership of our common shares have substantial influence regarding matters submitted for shareholder approval, including proposals regarding:\n\u2022\nany merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nthe election of members of our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nany amendment to our amended and restated certificate of formation.\nThe current or increased ownership position of any of these shareholders and/or their respective affiliates could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common shares. The interests of these shareholders and/or their respective affiliates may significantly differ from the interests of our other shareholders and they may vote the common shares they beneficially own in ways with which our other shareholders disagree.\nIn the future, we may seek bankruptcy protection, which may harm our business and place our equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their interests in our business.\nIf we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to finance our business or our Liquidity and capital resources are further constrained, including if we are unable to obtain the shareholder approvals necessary to make interest payments under the 1.5 Lien Notes and 1.75 Lien Term Loans with our common shares, a filing under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code may be unavoidable. Seeking bankruptcy protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and Liquidity. So long as a proceeding related to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy is ongoing, our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. Bankruptcy protection also might make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, the longer a proceeding related to a bankruptcy continues, the more likely it is that our customers and suppliers would lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and would seek to establish alternative commercial relationships or request financial assurances such as letters of credit and cash deposits.\nAdditionally, we have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our existing common shares in our capital structure. As a result, we believe that seeking bankruptcy protection could cause our common shares to be canceled, resulting in a limited recovery for shareholders, if any, and place equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their interests in our business.", "PERMNO": 91109, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EXCE"}
