You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties, and those described below may not be the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of these risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMETELSTAT\nOur future success depends solely on imetelstat, our only product candidate, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to develop imetelstat or advance imetelstat to subsequent clinical trials, or that we will be able to receive regulatory approval for imetelstat on a timely basis, or at all.\nImetelstat is our sole product candidate, upon whose success we are wholly dependent. We do not have any other products or product candidates. Our ability to develop imetelstat to and through regulatory approval and potential commercial launch is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nobtain sufficient safety and efficacy data from IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF to support any application for regulatory approval, without clinically meaningful safety issues, side effects or dose-limiting toxicities related to imetelstat that may negatively impact its benefit-risk profile, whether or not in the same indications or therapeutic areas;\n\u2022\nobtain substantial additional capital in order to enable us to conduct our operations and to advance the imetelstat program through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and to complete the clinical, regulatory and potential commercialization activities necessary to bring imetelstat to market in lower risk MDS and refractory MF;\n\u2022\nascertain that the use of imetelstat does not result in significant systemic or organ toxicities, including hepatotoxicity, or other safety issues resulting in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile;\n\u2022\ndevelop clinical plans for, and successfully commence, conduct and complete potential future clinical trials of imetelstat;\n\u2022\ngenerate sufficient safety and efficacy data from ongoing and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat that provide a positive benefit-risk profile to support the continued and future development of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nachieve full enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 in the second half of 2021, and top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 in the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023;\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain required regulatory clearances and approvals for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nenter into and maintain arrangements with third parties to provide services needed to further research and develop imetelstat, including maintaining the agreement with our CROs, or to manufacture imetelstat, in each case at commercially reasonable costs;\n\u2022\nenter into and maintain arrangements with third parties, or establish internal capabilities, to provide sales, marketing, distribution and other commercialization functions in compliance with applicable laws, and maintain sufficient commercial resources to launch imetelstat;\n\u2022\nachieve acceptance of imetelstat, if approved, by patients and the relevant medical communities;\n\u2022\ncompete effectively with other approved treatments;\n\u2022\nobtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of imetelstat from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nobtain, maintain and enforce adequate intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity for imetelstat both in the United States and globally; and\n\u2022\nrecruit and retain personnel sufficient to support the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat, including to conduct and complete IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat.\nIf we are not able to successfully achieve the above-stated goals and overcome other challenges that we may encounter in the research, development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat, we may be forced to abandon our development of imetelstat, which would severely harm our business and prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, could be interrupted, delayed, terminated or abandoned for a variety of reasons, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nCurrently, the active clinical trials of imetelstat are IMerge Phase 2, IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF. The fluidity and dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any firm estimates as to the ultimate effect COVID-19 will have on our clinical trials, our operations and our business all of which depend on the continued worldwide progress toward managing this health crisis. Although vaccine distribution has commenced in many countries, the emergence of COVID-19 variants causes further uncertainty and unpredictability on clinical trial activities, including clinical site initiations, patient screening and enrollment, as well as constraints on available sites and site personnel. As a result, we expect the pace of enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF trials to be slower. Under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the timing of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available during the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023. For IMpactMF, results are based on event-driven analyses. Under current assumptions, we expect that the interim analysis may occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. In addition, the conduct and completion of IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, and commencement and conduct of any potential future clinical trials\nof imetelstat, could be interrupted, delayed or abandoned for a variety of reasons, including as a result of failures or delays related to:\n\u2022\novercoming enrollment challenges related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in IMerge Phase 3, and successfully retaining patients in, and conducting and completing, IMerge Phase 3;\n\u2022\novercoming enrollment and operational challenges related to opening new clinical sites and conducting and completing IMpactMF due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, while also competing with clinical trials for other investigational drugs in the same patient population;\n\u2022\nobtaining and/or maintaining regulatory clearances in the United States or other countries to conduct clinical trials, such as obtaining or maintaining regulatory clearances to commence, conduct or modify current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, in a timely manner, or at all, which could, for example, prevent us from, or result in substantial delays in, conducting or completing IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, or commencing potential future clinical trials of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nmaintaining the INDs and equivalent submissions in other countries for imetelstat without such INDs and/or equivalent submissions in other countries being placed on full or partial clinical hold, suspended or subject to other requirements by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncontracting with a sufficient number of clinical trial sites to conduct current and potential future clinical trials, as well as identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators, especially given the constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other competing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtaining or accessing necessary clinical data in accordance with appropriate clinical or quality practices and regulatory requirements, in a timely and accurate manner to ensure complete data sets;\n\u2022\nresponding to safety findings by the data safety review committees of current clinical trials, and safety or futility findings by the data safety review committees of potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, based on emerging data occurring during such clinical trials, such as significant systemic or organ toxicities, including severe cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, fatal bleeding with or without any associated thrombocytopenia, patient injury or death, or other safety issues, resulting in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile;\n\u2022\nuse of trial endpoints that inherently require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data to determine trial outcomes;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of imetelstat, or other clinical trial materials, in a manner that meets the quality standards of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and responding to any disruptions to drug supply, clinical trial materials or quality issues that may arise, including as a result of limitations in available manufacturing capacity due to obligations to manufacture and distribute vaccines to address the COVID-19 pandemic; temporary or permanent shut down of contract manufacturing facilities due to violations of good manufacturing practice, or GMP, regulations or other applicable requirements; or infections or cross-contaminations of product candidates in the manufacturing process or capacity limitations;\n\u2022\nensuring the ability to manufacture and supply imetelstat at acceptable costs for potential future clinical trials of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nobtaining sufficient quantities of any study-related treatments, materials (including comparator products, placebo or combination therapies) or ancillary supplies, including in light of challenges and delays that may arise from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nobtaining acceptance by regulatory authorities of any manufacturing changes for imetelstat, as well as successfully implementing any such manufacturing changes;\n\u2022\ncomplying with current and future regulatory requirements, policies or guidelines, including domestic and international laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, transparency, and the privacy and security of health information;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms and on a timely basis, if at all, with collaborators, physician investigators, vendors and other third parties located in the United States or jurisdictions in other countries, including our CROs, laboratory service providers and clinical trial sites, on all aspects of clinical\ndevelopment and collaborating with them successfully, including with respect to challenges and delays that have arisen and may continue to arise from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthird-party clinical investigators or our CROs losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials according to our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or GCP, or regulatory requirements, or not performing data collection or analyses in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nthird-party contractors becoming debarred, disqualified or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other similar international regulatory authorities for violations of applicable regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or all of the data produced by such contractors in support of any applications for regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nobtaining timely review and clearances by regulatory authorities for any clinical protocol amendments or modifications to our manufacturing process which may be sought for current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including responding to questions or comments from these authorities in a timely and adequate manner, which could, for example, prevent us from conducting or completing IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, or commencing other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat; and\n\u2022\nobtaining institutional review board or ethics committee approvals for clinical trial protocols or protocol amendments, including any future refinements to the trial design we may seek for IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, or as a result of changes in regulatory requirements and policies, which could, for example, prevent us from conducting or completing IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF, and commencing potential future clinical trials of imetelstat.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated. Clinical trials may be suspended or terminated due to a number of factors, including: (a) failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols; (b) inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other countries resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold; (c) safety issues or adverse side effects; (d) failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug: or (e) changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nFailures or delays with respect to any of the aforementioned events could adversely affect our ability to conduct or complete IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, or to commence, conduct and complete potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, which could increase development costs, or interrupt, further delay or halt our development or potential commercialization of imetelstat, any of which could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nFurther difficulties enrolling or retaining patients in IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, whether as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reasons, could further delay or otherwise adversely affect our clinical development and commercialization activities, which would cause our business and business prospects to be severely harmed, and we might cease operations.\nThe timely completion of a clinical trial in accordance with its protocol depends, among other things, on the ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. Further challenges in screening, enrolling and retaining patients in IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, whether as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reasons, may further delay our conduct of such trials, or cause them to be discontinued. If we experience difficulties in retaining patients in the treatment or follow-up phase of IMerge Phase 2, whether as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reasons, our ability to continue to assess longer-term durability of RBC-TI responses would be adversely affected. The enrollment and retention of patients in IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, depend on many factors, such as:\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and screen patients who meet the patient eligibility criteria specified in the protocol;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoint;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of patients to trial sites, and patients\u2019 willingness and ability to travel to trial sites for treatment or monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trial, including potential patients\u2019 reluctance to participate in the trial due to the possibility of being assigned to a placebo control arm;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit and retain clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nclinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions of the potential advantages of imetelstat, both in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that have been (e.g., Reblozyl\u00ae for lower risk MDS) or may be approved for the indications being investigated, and as a result of data reported from previous or current clinical trials of imetelstat, and their willingness to participate in clinical trials of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nreduced availability of patients due to the recent approval of Reblozyl\u00ae in lower risk MDS;\n\u2022\nmonitoring patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that patients enrolled in any imetelstat clinical trial will drop out of the trial before completion due to lack of efficacy, adverse side effects, investigator decision, progressive disease, COVID-19 or COVID-19-related site activities and restrictions, alternate treatments being approved for the indication, or personal issues.\nIn addition, IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, as well as potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas with imetelstat, and such trials may also be conducted at the same clinical sites. This competition is reducing the number of clinical sites and hospital staff available to participate in IMpactMF, as well as the number and type of patients available to enroll or remain in current and potential future imetelstat clinical trials. Moreover, because imetelstat represents a departure from more commonly used methods for cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, rather than enroll patients into imetelstat clinical trials, or may decide not to enroll, or may not recommend enrollment, in IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF, based on efficacy and safety results reported to date and that may be reported in the future.\nDelays caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors in patient enrollment, or the inability to retain or treat patients, have resulted in and may in the future result in further increased costs due to extended timelines and other factors, and may lead to incomplete data sets, or adversely affect the timing or outcome of current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF, which could delay or prevent the commencement, conduct or completion of these trials and adversely affect the clinical development and potential commercialization of imetelstat. Such occurrences would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nImetelstat may cause, or have attributed to it, undesirable or unintended side effects or other adverse events that could further delay or prevent the commencement and/or completion of clinical trials for imetelstat, further delay or prevent its regulatory approval, or limit its commercial potential.\nImetelstat may cause, or have attributed to it, undesirable or unintended side effects or other adverse events affecting its safety or efficacy that could interrupt, further delay or halt current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF. For example, adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities observed in previous and ongoing clinical trials of imetelstat include:\n\u2022\nhematologic toxicities, such as profound and/or prolonged thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, including one case of febrile neutropenia after prolonged myelosuppression with intracranial hemorrhage resulting in patient death, which the investigator assessed as possibly related to imetelstat, as well as reversible Grade 4 febrile neutropenia;\n\u2022\nbleeding events, with or without thrombocytopenia, including reversible Grade 3/4 bleeding events;\n\u2022\nhepatotoxicity, such as liver function test abnormalities, the clinical significance and long-term consequences of which are currently undetermined, and hepatic failure;\n\u2022\ngastrointestinal events;\n\u2022\ninfections;\n\u2022\nmuscular and joint pain;\n\u2022\nfatigue;\n\u2022\nheadache; and\n\u2022\ninfusion-related reactions.\nIf patients in any clinical trials of imetelstat, including IMerge Phase 2, IMerge Phase 3, IMpactMF or any potential future clinical trial of imetelstat, experience similar or more severe adverse events, or new or unusual adverse events, or if the FDA or other regulatory authorities determine that efficacy and safety data in current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat do not support an adequate benefit-risk profile to justify continued treatment of patients, then the FDA or other regulatory authorities may again place one or more of the INDs for imetelstat on clinical hold, as occurred in March 2014. If this were to occur, there would be a significant delay in, or possible termination of, such clinical trial or all the imetelstat clinical trials, which might cause us to cease operations.\nFurther, clinical trials by their nature examine the effect of a potential therapy in a sample of the potential future patient population. As such, clinical trials conducted with imetelstat, to date and in the future, may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients treated with imetelstat may experience. Because remaining patients in IMerge Phase 2, IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF continue to receive imetelstat treatment, additional or more severe toxicities or safety issues, including additional serious adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities, may be observed as patient treatment continues and more data become available. In addition, because additional data are being generated from these trials, the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat will continue to be assessed, including the risk of hepatotoxicity, severe cytopenias, fatal bleeding with or without any associated thrombocytopenia, patient injury or death, and any other severe adverse effects that may be associated with life-threatening clinical outcomes. If such toxicities or other safety issues in any clinical trial of imetelstat are determined by us, the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other countries to result in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile, then:\n\u2022\nadditional information supporting the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat may be requested by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries and if any such information supplied by us, or by our former collaboration partner, is not deemed acceptable, current clinical trials of imetelstat could be suspended, terminated, or placed on clinical hold by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other countries;\n\u2022\nthe ability to retain enrolled patients in current clinical trials may be negatively affected, resulting in incomplete data sets and the inability to adequately assess the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in a specific patient population; or\n\u2022\nadditional, unexpected clinical trials or non-clinical studies may be required to be conducted.\nThe occurrence of any of the aforementioned events could interrupt, further delay, or halt, any development and potential commercialization of imetelstat by us, which would have a severe adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and the future of imetelstat, any of which might cause us to cease operations.\nResults and data we disclosed from prior non-clinical studies and clinical trials may not predict success in later clinical trials, and we cannot assure you that any ongoing or future clinical trials of imetelstat will lead to similar results and data that could potentially enable us to obtain any regulatory approvals.\nSuccess in non-clinical testing and early clinical trials, including Phase 2 clinical trials, such as IMerge Phase 2 and IMbark, does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, nor does it predict final clinical trial results. We cannot be certain that any of the prior, current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat will generate sufficient, consistent or adequate efficacy and safety data demonstrating a positive benefit-risk profile, which would be necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market imetelstat in any indication. Imetelstat in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired benefit-risk profile despite having progressed through non-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. Many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have frequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier non-clinical studies or clinical trials.\nThe design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support regulatory approval of a product, and flaws in the trial design may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or during the approval process after the trial is completed. A trial design that is considered appropriate for regulatory approval includes a sufficiently large sample size with appropriate statistical power, as well as proper control of bias, to allow a meaningful interpretation of the results. The preliminary results of imetelstat clinical trials with smaller sample sizes can be disproportionately influenced by the impact the treatment had on a few individuals, which limits the ability to generalize the results across a broader community, making the trial results less reliable than trials with a larger number of patients. As a result, there may be less certainty that imetelstat would achieve a statistically significant effect in any\nfuture clinical trials. Moreover, with respect to the trial design for IMpactMF, the FDA urged us to consider adding a third dosing arm to the trial to assess a lower dose and/or a more frequent dosing schedule that might improve the trial\u2019s chance of success by identifying a less toxic regimen and/or more effective spleen response, one of the trial\u2019s secondary endpoints. Based on data from IMbark, we believe that testing a lower dose regimen would likely result in a lower median OS, which is the trial\u2019s primary endpoint, in the imetelstat treatment arm. Existing data also suggest that lowering the dose would not result in a clinically meaningful reduction in toxicity, and for these reasons we therefore determined not to add a third dosing arm to the trial design, and the FDA did not object to our proposed imetelstat dose and schedule of 9.4 mg/kg every three weeks. Our belief may ultimately be incorrect. Therefore, our failure to add a third dosing arm could result in a failure to maintain regulatory clearance from the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries, could result in the trial\u2019s failure, or could otherwise delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of imetelstat in refractory MF by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries.\nIn addition, in IMerge Phase 2, the initial data review for the 25-patient expansion cohort that was conducted by Janssen in the second quarter of 2018, which Janssen called a \u201cdata snapshot,\u201d exhibited an eight-week RBC-TI rate of 28%, while the 13-patient initial cohort exhibited an eight-week RBC-TI rate of 54%, resulting in an overall eight-week RBC-TI rate of 37% for the combined cohorts. Patients in both the initial and expansion cohorts were na\u00efve to both HMA and lenalidomide and were non-del(5q). We believe the observed difference in eight-week RBC-TI rate between the 13-patient initial cohort and the 25-patient expansion cohort may be attributable to factors such as the maturity of the data at the time of the data snapshot, since the median follow-up time of the expansion cohort at the time of the data snapshot was less than half the length of time the 13-patient initial cohort had been followed when their data were first reported, or the higher overall baseline transfusion burden of the expansion cohort. Although the latest reported eight-week RBC-TI rate in June 2020 is higher than that reported in the data snapshot from the second quarter of 2018, we cannot assure you that the eight-week RBC-TI rate reported for the combined cohorts in IMerge Phase 2 will improve further with longer follow-up, or at all, or that the eight-week RBC-TI rate of patients enrolled in IMerge Phase 3 will be comparable to what has been reported in the 13-patient initial cohort, the 25-patient expansion cohort, or the combined cohorts in IMerge Phase 2. In general, Phase 3 clinical trials with larger numbers of patients or longer durations of therapy may fail to replicate efficacy and safety results observed in earlier clinical trials, such as IMerge Phase 2 and IMbark, and if this were to occur with IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF, this would adversely affect future development prospects of imetelstat and may cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, non-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. In some instances, there can be significant variability between different clinical trials of imetelstat due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in trial protocols, differences in the size and type of patient populations, and changes in and adherence to the dosing regimens. For example, complete and partial remissions were observed in the pilot study of imetelstat conducted at Mayo Clinic, or the Pilot Study. However, similar activity was not observed in the MF patients enrolled in IMbark, as shown by the one partial remission observed in the IMbark primary analysis. We believe that differences in the IMbark study design when compared to the Pilot Study design, such as more restrictive patient enrollment criteria requiring either documented objective lack of response to a JAK inhibitor or evidence of progressive disease while on treatment with a JAK inhibitor, may have contributed to the data observed in IMbark differing significantly from data reported from the Pilot Study, but we cannot assure you that any future clinical trials of imetelstat in MF will yield results comparable to IMbark or the Pilot Study. In addition, the potential improvement in survival observed in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark will need to be further assessed in IMpactMF, and similar results, including potential improvement in survival, if any, with respect to any patient population or patient population subgroup, may not be observed in IMpactMF. Likewise, although the statistical analyses comparing IMbark data to closely matched real-world data, or RWD, reported at the EHA Annual Congress meeting in June 2019 suggest favorable OS for imetelstat-treated relapsed/refractory MF patients compared to BAT using closely matched patients\u2019 RWD, such comparative analyses between RWD and our clinical trial data have several limitations. For instance, the analyses create a balance between treatment groups with respect to commonly available covariates, but do not take into account the unmeasured and unknown covariates that may affect the outcomes of the analyses. Potential biases are introduced by factors which include, for example, the selection of the patients included in the analyses, misclassification in the matching process, the small sample size, and estimates that may not represent the outcomes for the true treated patient population. For these and other reasons, such comparative analyses and any conclusions from such analyses should be considered carefully and with caution, and should not be relied upon as demonstrative or otherwise predictive or indicative of any current or potential future clinical trial results of imetelstat in relapsed/refractory MF, including IMpactMF.\nFailure to achieve positive results in current or potential future imetelstat clinical trials would interrupt, further delay, or halt, any development and potential commercialization of imetelstat by us, which would have a severe adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and the future of imetelstat, any of\nwhich might cause us to cease operations.\nInterim, \u201csnapshot,\u201d \u201ctop-line,\u201d and preliminary data or statistical analyses from clinical trials that we announce or publish from time-to-time may change as more patient data become available, may be more positive than the final data, and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. Thus, such preliminary data should be considered carefully and with caution and not relied upon as indicative of future clinical results.\nFrom time-to-time, preliminary or interim safety and efficacy data from previous and current imetelstat clinical trials have been reported or announced by us, clinical investigators or our prior collaboration partner(s). For example, preliminary data from IMerge Phase 2 were reported at the ASH Annual Meetings in December 2017, December 2018 and December 2020, and at the EHA Annual Congress meetings in June 2018, June 2019 and June 2020. We expect similar reports or announcements of safety and efficacy data from us or clinical investigators as data continues to mature in our IMerge Phase 2. Preliminary or interim results may not be reproduced in any current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and thus should be considered carefully and with caution, and not relied upon as indicative of future clinical results. Material adverse differences in final data, compared to preliminary or interim data, could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nAdditional or updated safety and efficacy data from current or potential future imetelstat clinical trials may result in a benefit-risk profile that does not justify the continued development of imetelstat in a particular patient population, or at all. For example, because patients remaining in the treatment phase continue to receive imetelstat in IMerge Phase 2, efficacy and safety data continue to be generated from the trial and will continue to evolve until all patients have ceased treatment. More mature data that may be reported in the future from IMerge Phase 2, and any data reported from IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF, may materially differ from and be less positive than data previously reported from IMerge Phase 2 and IMbark. Thus, the reported data should be considered carefully and with caution, and not relied upon as indicative of future clinical results. Such additional data could result in a lower benefit-risk profile than initially expected, which could hinder the enrollment, completion and potential success of IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF, or cause us to abandon further development of imetelstat entirely.\nThe research and development of imetelstat is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe science and technology of telomere biology, telomerase and our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry are relatively new. There is no precedent for the successful commercialization of a therapeutic product candidate based on these technologies. Significant research and development activities will be necessary to further develop imetelstat, our sole product candidate, and may take years to accomplish, if at all.\nBecause of the significant scientific, regulatory and commercial challenges that must be overcome to successfully research, develop and commercialize imetelstat, the development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including MF and MDS, may be further delayed or abandoned, even after significant resources have been expended on it. Examples of such situations include:\n\u2022\nin September 2012, the discontinuation of our Phase 2 clinical trial of imetelstat in metastatic breast cancer;\n\u2022\nin April 2013, the discontinuation of our development of imetelstat in solid tumors with short telomeres;\n\u2022\nin March 2014, the full clinical hold placed by the FDA on imetelstat clinical trials;\n\u2022\nin the third quarter of 2016, closure of the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark to new patient enrollment and suspension of enrollment in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark because an insufficient number of patients in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm met the protocol defined interim efficacy criteria at 12 weeks;\n\u2022\nin the third quarter of 2017, expansion of IMerge Phase 2 to enroll additional lower risk MDS patients in a target patient population; and\n\u2022\nin September 2018, Janssen\u2019s decision to terminate the Collaboration Agreement.\nFurther delay, suspension or abandonment of the development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including resulting from our inability to successfully enroll, conduct and complete IMerge Phase 3 and\nIMpactMF, and to plan for, commence, conduct and complete potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, could have a material adverse effect on the future of imetelstat and our business prospects, and we might cease operations.\nWe have limited experience as a company in conducting large-scale, late-stage clinical trials, such as IMerge Phase 3, IMpactMF, or potential future similar trials, and no prior experience as a company in those functional areas that would be required for the successful commercialization of our sole product candidate, imetelstat.\nAlthough we have hired individuals who have experience conducting Phase 3 clinical trials, as a company we have limited experience in conducting large-scale, late-stage clinical trials, such as IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF. We cannot be certain that we will be able to enroll, conduct or complete either trial, or any other potential future large-scale, late-stage clinical trial of imetelstat, in a timely fashion, or at all. These large-scale, late-stage clinical trials require internal development experience that we are beginning to develop; and therefore, we still rely heavily on third-party clinical investigators, CROs, service providers, vendors, suppliers and consultants. Relying on these third parties and establishing effective and collaborative relationships with them to conduct large-scale, late-stage clinical trials may cause delays that are outside of our control. Any such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not have experience as a company with activities that would be required for the commercialization of imetelstat, should we receive future regulatory approval to do so. Developing an internal sales, marketing and distribution capability is an expensive and time-consuming process, and will require additional management expertise. We may not be able to negotiate and enter into third-party marketing and distribution agreements on terms that are economically attractive, or at all. Even if we do enter into such agreements, third-party marketers and distributors may not successfully market or distribute our sole product candidate, imetelstat.\nOur inability to successfully plan, commence, enroll, conduct and complete large-scale, late-stage clinical trials, such as IMerge Phase 3, IMpactMF or potential future similar trials, or to successfully establish commercialization capabilities for imetelstat if we receive future regulatory approval to do so, would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to continue the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize imetelstat.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials. Therefore, we rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, service providers, vendors, suppliers and consultants, to conduct clinical trials of imetelstat. The third parties we contract with for execution of our current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat play a critical role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control their performance, or the amount or timing of resources that they devote to imetelstat. For example, we have retained CROs to support our imetelstat clinical development activities, and any failure by our CROs to perform their contractual obligations whether due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, or disputes with our CROs about the quality of their performance or other matters, could prevent us from enrolling, conducting or completing IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF, or could otherwise further delay or halt our imetelstat clinical development activities including current or future imetelstat clinical trials. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Under certain circumstances, these third parties may terminate their agreements with us without cause and upon immediate written notice.\nAlthough we rely on third parties to conduct any imetelstat clinical trials, including IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, we remain responsible for ensuring that each clinical trial is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol, and applicable laws. Moreover, the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries require us to comply with GCP regulations and standards for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of patients participating in clinical trials are protected, including being adequately informed of the potential risks. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, or similar regulatory authorities in other countries, may require us to perform additional clinical trials before\napproving any application for approval. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP or other applicable regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register imetelstat clinical trials that we sponsor and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on certain government-sponsored databases, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. Our ability to comply with these regulations and standards is contingent upon activities conducted by third parties, and if they fail to perform in accordance with contractual obligations and legal requirements, our development of imetelstat may be interrupted, further delayed or halted, which would have a severe adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and the future of imetelstat, any of which might cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, the execution of clinical trials and the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data produced, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. If the quality or accuracy of the clinical data obtained, compiled or analyzed by third parties is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols, GCP or GMP requirements, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which would cause delay, and could be difficult, costly or impossible. If third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, or may be unsuccessful or need to be repeated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third parties or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs, investigators and other third parties involves additional costs and delays because of the time it takes to finalize a contract with a new CRO and their commencement of work. As a result, delays can occur, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. The COVID-19 pandemic and public health safety measures taken in response have also had a significant impact on our CROs. Although we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, investigators and other third parties, our CROs and we may nonetheless encounter challenges or delays in the future, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, business prospects and the future of imetelstat.\nIn addition, certain principal investigators for our clinical trials serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA. The FDA may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the trial. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of any applications for approval by the FDA and may ultimately lead to the denial of approval of imetelstat.\nRISKS RELATED TO COVID-19\nThe effects of the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic have negatively impacted, and will likely continue to negatively impact, our business and health care resources around the world, including a significant number of clinical sites involved with IMerge Phase 3 and planned clinical sites for IMpactMF.\nOur business and business prospects, our financial condition and the future of imetelstat generally could be materially and adversely affected by the effects of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and public health safety measures taken in response to COVID-19 have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses, as significant reductions in business-related activities have occurred, clinical development and regulatory activities have been curtailed, delayed or suspended and supply chains have been disrupted. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and \u201cshelter in place\u201d and similar orders issued by state and local governments, we have temporarily restricted access to our offices in California and New Jersey. Many of our employees continue to conduct their work remotely, and they otherwise have minimal presence in our offices for essential activities. The effects of the \u201cshelter in place\u201d and similar orders, as well our own policies, may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and continue to delay our imetelstat development program and clinical trial timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct\nour business in the ordinary course. In addition, our increased reliance on personnel working remotely could increase our cybersecurity risk, create data accessibility concerns and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could continue to negatively impact our business and business prospects, our financial condition and the future of imetelstat.\nDue to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had and expect to continue to have, or we may potentially have in the future, disruptions and/or delays in our imetelstat development program, including with respect to our ability to:\n\u2022\nopen trial sites for screening and enrollment;\n\u2022\nscreen, enroll and assess patients;\n\u2022\nretain enrolled patients in the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nensure patient clinical and lab collection visits;\n\u2022\nconduct monitoring visits;\n\u2022\nmanufacture and/or supply study drug;\n\u2022\nreport trial results; or\n\u2022\ninteract with regulators or other important agencies due to limitations in employee resources or otherwise.\nFor IMerge Phase 3, we have clinical trial sites in many countries that have had high incident rates of COVID-19. Restrictions on travel, availability of site personnel, and diversion of hospital staff and resources to COVID-19 patients, have disrupted our trial operations, as well as patient recruitment in many areas, resulting in a slowdown in patient enrollment and/or deviations from or disruptions in key clinical trial activities, such as opening, initiating and monitoring clinical trial sites. Although vaccine distribution has commenced in many countries, the emergence of COVID-19 variants causes further uncertainty and unpredictability on clinical trial activities, including clinical site initiations, patient screening and enrollment. As a result, we expect the pace of enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 to be slower. Under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the timing of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available during the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023. Based on current planning assumptions, if full enrollment completes after the third quarter of 2021, top-line results will not be available by the end of 2022.\nFor IMpactMF, we plan to open multiple clinical trial sites to patient enrollment. Similar to IMerge Phase 3, many of these clinical trial sites are in countries that have had high incident rates of COVID-19. As such, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruption in clinical trial activities and delays in enrollment, as well as constraints on available sites and site personnel. Given these challenges, under current planning assumptions, we expect that the interim analysis may occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because IMpactMF results are based on event-driven analyses, the results may be available at different times than currently expected.\nIf the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue and persist for an extended period of time and/or become more severe, we could experience further disruptions to our clinical development timelines, continued delays in enrollment and clinical trial site initiation in IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, and other disruptions that could severely impact our business and the imetelstat development program, including those resulting from:\n\u2022\nnew, continued or heightened difficulties in opening clinical trial sites for patient screening and enrollment and recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022\ncontinued or heightened delays or difficulties caused by missed patient clinical and lab collection visits, and uncertainty how the FDA will view these deviations from the protocol caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\npotential refusal by the FDA to accept data, including from clinical trials in affected geographies or failure to comply with updated FDA guidance and expectations related to the conduct of clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ncontinued or heightened delays or disruptions in clinical trial activities due to reduced availability of personnel at CROs and vendors;\n\u2022\nsubstantial reduction of health care resources available for the conduct of clinical trials, including the temporary postponement of clinical trial activities at certain hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and diversion of hospital staff away from the conduct of our clinical trials, such as those experienced by us to date;\n\u2022\ninterruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures (particularly any procedures that may be deemed non-essential), which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical study endpoints;\n\u2022\nloss of potential and recruited patients in clinical trials due to clinical site COVID-19 activities, desire of patients to avoid frequent visits to hospitals because of potential increased exposure to COVID-19, or loss of life of patients due to COVID-19;\n\u2022\ninterruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of imetelstat from our contract manufacturing organizations due to among other things, staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages, shortages in raw materials or laboratory supplies because of ongoing efforts to address the pandemic, limitations in available capacity at contract manufacturing vendors or drug distribution service providers due to obligations to manufacture and distribute vaccines to address the spread of COVID-19, disruptions in supply chain and production systems and import/export complications;\n\u2022\nincreased costs for clinical trial activities due to delays or disruptions in opening sites, screening and enrolling patients or treating and following patients, whether as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reasons, which would require further additional capital that may not be available; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, product development, manufacturing, and general company operations, including because of sickness of employees or their families, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people, an increased reliance on working from home, or mass transit disruptions.\nThese and other factors arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further adversely impact our ability to enroll, conduct and complete IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and any other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and business prospects, our financial condition and the future of imetelstat.\nIn addition, we rely on third-party CROs and other third parties to assist us with clinical trial activities. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on our CROs, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, absenteeism by governmental employees or the focus of regulatory authorities\u2019 efforts and attention on the approval of other therapeutics or other activities related to COVID-19 could likewise impact the timeliness of regulatory authority responses and the processing of regulatory submissions for imetelstat. In any event, if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue and persist for an extended period of time and/or become more severe, we may experience significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines, which would materially and adversely affect our business and business prospects, our financial condition and the future of imetelstat.\nWhile at this time we believe that we have sufficient drug supply for IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, we could experience disruptions to our supply chain, as well as delays or limitations in our ability to obtain sufficient materials for the manufacture of imetelstat for our current and potential future clinical trials. Such disruptions could adversely affect our ability to conduct ongoing and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat. For example, some of our suppliers of certain materials used in the production of imetelstat are located in countries that were or are heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In these countries, closures and other restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak in the region could disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for the manufacture of imetelstat. In addition, we may experience limitations in available capacity at contract manufacturers or drug suppliers, or potential shortages of consumable manufacturing supplies, due to obligations to manufacture and distribute vaccines to address the spread of COVID-19. For example, we have experienced manufacturing schedule delays at one of our contract manufacturers due to government mandated manufacturing of high priority COVID-19 vaccines in connection with Operation Warp Speed, and we anticipate such delays, or potential shortages of consumable manufacturing supplies, may continue in 2021.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 have increased market volatility and could result in a significant long-term disruption of global financial markets, reducing or eliminating our ability to raise additional capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity and our ability to further advance the imetelstat program, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and conducting the clinical, regulatory and potential commercialization activities necessary to bring imetelstat to market in lower risk MDS and refractory MF. If top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available after the end of 2022, we will require additional capital to reach top-line results. In addition, the global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, our regulatory and clinical development activities, clinical supply chain and other business operations, as well as the value of and market for our common stock, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States and in other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat COVID-19. Accordingly, we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our regulatory and clinical development activities, clinical supply chain and other business operations or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could materially and adversely affect our business and business prospects, our financial condition and the future of imetelstat. In addition, to the extent the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affect our business and financial condition, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance Matters and Commercialization of Imetelstat\nOur inability to maintain regulatory clearances and approvals to continue the clinical development of, and to potentially commercialize, imetelstat, would severely and adversely affect imetelstat\u2019s future value, and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nFederal, state and local governments in the United States and governments in other countries have significant regulations in place that govern drug research and development and may prevent us from successfully conducting development efforts or potentially commercializing imetelstat. Delays in obtaining or failure to maintain regulatory clearances and approvals or limitations in the scope of such clearances or approvals could:\n\u2022\nimpede or halt our activities and plans for clinical development and commercialization;\n\u2022\nsignificantly harm the commercial potential of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nimpose additional development costs;\n\u2022\ndiminish any competitive advantages that may have been available to us; or\n\u2022\nfurther delay or preclude any revenue we may receive from the future commercialization of imetelstat, if any.\nBefore we can seek to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of imetelstat, we need to demonstrate that imetelstat is safe and effective in IMerge Phase 3, IMpact MF or potential additional clinical trials of imetelstat. We will need to complete significant additional research, manufacturing activities and clinical testing as well as other assessments before we can submit any application with the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other countries for regulatory approval of imetelstat, including confirming compliance with the agreed pediatric plans with EMA and FDA.\nIn addition, with respect to the trial design for IMpactMF, the FDA urged us to consider adding a third dosing arm to the trial to assess a lower dose and/or a more frequent dosing schedule that might improve the trial\u2019s chance of success by identifying a less toxic regimen and/or more effective spleen response, one of the trial\u2019s secondary endpoints. Based on data from IMbark, we believe that testing a lower dose regimen would likely result in a lower median OS, which is the trial\u2019s primary endpoint, in the imetelstat treatment arm. Existing data also suggest that lowering the dose would not result in a clinically meaningful reduction in toxicity, and for these reasons we therefore determined not to add a third dosing arm to the trial design and the FDA did not object to our proposed imetelstat dose and schedule of 9.4 mg/kg every three weeks. Our belief may ultimately be incorrect. Therefore, our failure to add a third dosing arm could result in a failure to maintain regulatory clearance from the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries, could result in the trial\u2019s failure, or could otherwise delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of\nimetelstat for refractory MF by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries.\nIf imetelstat cannot be successfully developed in our current Phase 3 clinical trials, IMerge or IMpactMF, our business and business prospects would be severely and adversely affected, and we might cease operations. Even if we do successfully complete one or more of our Phase 3 clinical trials of imetelstat, the results will not necessarily be predictive of imetelstat activity in new indications and for future pivotal trials that may be needed to support any application to FDA or similar regulatory authorities for such new indications. We may therefore fail to further develop or commercialize imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nObtaining potential future regulatory clearances to market imetelstat in the United States and other countries is a costly and lengthy process, and we cannot predict when or if regulatory authorities will approve imetelstat for commercial sale.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and in other countries, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage complete the regulatory approval process and are successfully commercialized. In addition, the lengthy review process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in a delay in obtaining, or our failure to obtain regulatory approval for imetelstat in lower risk MDS or refractory MF, which would significantly harm our business, business prospects and the future value of imetelstat and might cause us to cease operations.\nSecuring marketing approval requires the submission of extensive non-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy, as well as information about the product manufacturing process and any inspections of manufacturing facilities conducted by regulatory authorities through the filing of an NDA in the United States and an MAA in the EU. As a company, we have not previously submitted an NDA or similar applications to comparable regulatory authorities in other countries for imetelstat.\nImetelstat must receive all relevant regulatory approvals before it may be marketed in the United States or other countries. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and can delay, limit or deny approval of imetelstat or require us to conduct additional non-clinical or clinical testing or abandon a program for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndisagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nunfavorable benefit-to-risk assessment, in the case of marginal efficacy and/or clinically relevant safety concerns;\n\u2022\nserious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to imetelstat;\n\u2022\ndisagreement with our interpretation of data from non-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nerrors or deficiencies in the conduct of the imetelstat program prior to its transition to us by our former collaborator, and/or in the transition of the imetelstat program to us by our former collaborator;\n\u2022\nunwillingness or inability by our former collaborator to provide information requested by the FDA or other regulatory authorities regarding the time period when our former collaborator was responsible for the imetelstat program;\n\u2022\nrequirement to develop a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, including post-marketing studies, as a potential condition to approval;\n\u2022\ndisagreement regarding the formulation, labeling and/or the specifications for imetelstat;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers; or\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory policies or approval processes, or potential reduction of unmet medical need with the entry of competitive therapies to the market, could render our clinical efficacy or safety data insufficient for approval.\nAny marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render imetelstat not commercially viable, which would harm imetelstat\u2019s future value and our business and business prospects. In addition, obtaining regulatory approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. For example, following the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, and its withdrawal from the European Union was completed on December 31, 2020. Although the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will not be known for some time, it has resulted in considerable uncertainty in relation to the regulatory process in Europe, which could result in a delay in the review of regulatory submissions made in Europe by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including potentially by us in the future, and could also lead to less efficient, more expensive, and potentially lengthier regulatory review processes for companies like us, who may seek to obtain regulatory approval for drug products in the European Union or the United Kingdom. Such regulatory changes in the United Kingdom or elsewhere could adversely affect and/or delay our ability to obtain approval of, and market and sell, imetelstat in the United States or other countries.\nRegulatory authorities may also not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of a drug, such as imetelstat. For example, future regulatory clearances, if any, that we might obtain for imetelstat may be limited to fewer or narrower indications than we might request, or may be granted subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. Future regulatory clearances, if any, may be limited to a smaller patient population, or may require a different drug formulation or a different manufacturing process, than we might in the future decide to seek.\nIn addition, failure by our former collaborator to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines prior to our assumption of sponsorship of the imetelstat program could result in administrative or judicially imposed sanctions on us, including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, product seizures or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of manufacturing activities, and the potential refusal to approve any NDAs.\nAny delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals of imetelstat, or limitations on any regulatory approval that we might receive in the future, if any, could reduce the potential commercial use of imetelstat, and potential market demand for imetelstat and therefore result in decreased revenue for us from any commercialization of imetelstat, any of which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, the price of our common stock, our business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nAlthough orphan drug designation has been granted to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and MDS in the United States and in the EU, these designations may not be maintained, which would eliminate the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity, which would likely result in decreased sales revenue from commercialization of imetelstat, if any, and would likely harm our business and business prospects.\nThe FDA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat in June 2015 for the treatment of MF and for the treatment of MDS in December 2015, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted orphan drug designation in December 2015 to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and in July 2020 for the treatment of MDS. The designation of imetelstat as an orphan drug does not guarantee that any regulatory authority will accelerate regulatory review of, or ultimately approve, imetelstat, nor does it limit the ability of any regulatory authority to grant orphan drug designation to product candidates of other companies that treat the same indications as imetelstat prior to imetelstat receiving any exclusive marketing approval.\nWe may lose orphan drug exclusivity if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for orphan drug designation was materially defective or if we cannot ensure sufficient quantities of imetelstat to meet the needs of patients with MF or MDS. Failure to maintain orphan designation status in the EU at the time of submitting the MAA would lead to the loss of the additional two-year exclusivity period.\nEven if we maintain orphan drug exclusivity for imetelstat, the exclusivity may not effectively protect imetelstat from all competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug product is approved, the FDA or EMA can subsequently approve a different drug with the same active moiety for the same condition, if the FDA or EMA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. The occurrence of any of these events could result in decreased sales of imetelstat, should it ever receive marketing approval, and may harm our business and business prospects. In addition, orphan drug designation will neither shorten the development time nor regulatory review time for imetelstat, and it\ndoes not give imetelstat any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nA Fast Track designation by the FDA, such as the Fast Track designations received for imetelstat for MDS and MF, does not guarantee marketing approval and may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval process.\nIn October 2017, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to imetelstat for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low or Intermediate-1 risk MDS who are non-del(5q) and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an ESA. In September 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to imetelstat for the treatment of adult patients with Intermediate-2 or High-risk MF whose disease has relapsed after or is refractory to JAK inhibitor treatment.\nFast Track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA review staff, as well as eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review of the sponsor\u2019s NDA. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of an NDA to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. However, Fast Track designation does not accelerate conduct of clinical trials or mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent, nor does it ensure that any imetelstat NDA will be approved or that any approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation for any indication if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the imetelstat clinical development program.\nFailure to achieve continued compliance with government regulations could delay or halt potential commercialization of imetelstat.\nApproved products and their manufacturers are subject to continual review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer, including import restrictions, seizure and withdrawal of the product from the market. If approved for commercial sale, future sales of imetelstat will be subject to government regulation related to numerous matters, including the processes of:\n\u2022\nmanufacturing;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promoting;\n\u2022\nselling and marketing;\n\u2022\nlabeling; and\n\u2022\ndistribution.\nIf, and to the extent that, we are unable to comply with these regulations, our ability to earn potential revenue from the commercialization of imetelstat, if any, would be materially and adversely impacted.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in severe civil and criminal penalties, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of products;\n\u2022\ninjunctions against the import, manufacture, distribution, sales and/or marketing of products; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties or other commercial limitations would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing Imetelstat\nFailure by us to establish and/or maintain a manufacturing supply chain to appropriately and adequately supply imetelstat for future clinical and commercial uses, would result in a further delay in or cessation of clinical trials and a further delay in or our inability to obtain regulatory approvals of imetelstat, and our business and business prospects could be severely harmed, and we could cease operations.\nAlthough we have purchased inventories of drug product, drug substance and raw materials from our former collaboration partner under a supply agreement that meet our specifications, some of this material will require further processing in order to be used in clinical trials, and/or may also require regulatory review and acceptance prior to use. In addition, while we have re-established our own manufacturing supply chain in order to further process such purchased materials as well as to be able to manufacture and supply additional quantities of imetelstat that meet applicable regulatory standards for current and potential future clinical trials and potential commercial uses, the process of manufacturing imetelstat is complex and remains subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability to scale-up and attain sufficient production yields with appropriate quality control and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nreliance on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and suppliers, whose efforts we do not control;\n\u2022\nsupply chain issues, including the timely availability and shelf life requirements of raw materials and other supplies, any of which may be impacted by a number of factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nshortage of qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\nregulatory acceptance and compliance with regulatory requirements, which are less well-defined for oligonucleotide products than for small molecule drugs and vary in each country where imetelstat might be sold or used.\nAs a result of these and other risks, we may be unable to establish and/or maintain a manufacturing supply chain capable of providing imetelstat for IMerge Phase 3, IMpactMF, and/or other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and potential future commercial uses, which would delay or result in a cessation of IMerge Phase 3, IMpactMF, or other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat. Occurrence of any such events would further delay or preclude any applications for regulatory approval and therefore further delay or preclude our ability to earn revenue from the commercialization, if any, of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf third parties that manufacture imetelstat fail to perform as needed, then the clinical and commercial supply of imetelstat will be limited, and we may be unable to conduct or complete current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat or to commercialize imetelstat in the future.\nOur imetelstat manufacturing supply chain relies, and will continue to rely, solely upon third-party contractors to perform certain process development or other technical and scientific work with respect to imetelstat, as well as to supply starting materials and manufacture drug substance and drug product. While we have established arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of imetelstat, our manufacturing supply chain is highly specialized, and as such we are reliant upon a small group of third-party contractors to supply starting materials, drug substance and drug product. Failure by such third-party contractors to perform in a timely manner, or at all, could further delay, perhaps substantially, or preclude our ability to pursue imetelstat development on our own, increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our financial results, business and business prospects. We may not be able to obtain imetelstat from third-party contractors on acceptable terms, or at all. We expect to rely on third-party contractors to produce and deliver sufficient quantities of imetelstat and other materials to support clinical trials on a timely basis and to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. We do not have direct control over these third-party personnel or operations. Reliance on these third-party manufacturers is subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nbeing unable to contract with suitable third-party manufacturers, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited;\n\u2022\ndelays and disruptions experienced by third-party manufacturers due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact the ability of such parties to fulfill their contractual obligations to us;\n\u2022\nlimitations in available capacity at contract manufacturers or drug suppliers, or potential shortages of consumable manufacturing supplies, due to obligations to manufacture and distribute vaccines to address the spread of COVID-19; for example, we have experienced manufacturing schedule delays at one of our contract manufacturers due to government mandated manufacturing for high priority COVID-19 vaccines in connection with Operation Warp Speed, and we anticipate such delays, or potential shortages of consumable manufacturing supplies, may continue in 2021;\n\u2022\nrequirements by regulatory authorities for significant activities to validate and qualify any replacement manufacturer, which could involve new testing and compliance inspections;\n\u2022\nthe inability to execute timely contracts with additional third-party manufacturers and suppliers on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe inability of third-party manufacturers to timely formulate and manufacture imetelstat or to produce imetelstat in the quantities or of the quality required to meet clinical and commercial needs, whether due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other reasons;\n\u2022\ndecisions by third-party manufacturers to exit the contract manufacturing business during the time required to supply clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute products;\n\u2022\ncompliance by third-party manufacturers with cGMP standards mandated by the FDA and state agencies and other government regulations corresponding to similar regulatory authorities in other countries;\n\u2022\nbreach or termination of manufacturing or supply contracts;\n\u2022\ninadequate storage or maintenance at contracted facilities resulting in theft or spoilage;\n\u2022\ncapacity limitation and scheduling imetelstat manufacturing activities as a priority in contracted facilities; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters that affect contracted facilities.\nEach of these risks could lead to delays or shortages in drug supply, or the inability to manufacture drug supply necessary for non-clinical and clinical activities, and commercialization. For example, manufacturing delays could adversely impact the conduct or completion of imetelstat clinical trials, such as IMerge Phase 3, IMpactMF or commencement of other potential future clinical trials, or preclude or delay potential future commercial sales, which could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, third-party contractors and/or any other contractors may need to make substantial investments to enable sufficient capacity increases and cost reductions, and to implement those regulatory and compliance standards necessary for successful Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial production of imetelstat. These third-party contractors may not be willing or able to achieve such capacity increases, cost reductions, or regulatory and compliance standards, and even if they do, such achievements may not be at commercially reasonable costs. Changing manufacturers may be prolonged and difficult due to inherent technical complexities and because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIt may not be possible to manufacture imetelstat at costs or scales necessary to conduct clinical trials or potential future commercialization activities.\nOligonucleotides are relatively large molecules produced using complex chemistry, and the cost of manufacturing an oligonucleotide like imetelstat is greater than the cost of making typical small molecule drugs. Therefore, imetelstat for clinical use is more expensive to manufacture than most other treatments currently available today or that may be available in the future. Similarly, the cost of manufacturing imetelstat for commercial use will need to be significantly lower than current costs in order for imetelstat to become a commercially successful product. We may not be able to achieve sufficient scale increases or cost reductions necessary for successful commercial production of imetelstat. Failure to achieve necessary cost reductions could result in decreased sales, if any, for us, which would materially and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need For Additional Financing\nOur failure to obtain substantial additional capital would force us to further delay, reduce or eliminate development of imetelstat, including IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and our potential future imetelstat commercialization efforts, any of which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nSuccessful drug development and commercialization requires significant amounts of capital. Currently, we believe we have sufficient funds for our operations until the end of 2022. Taking into account the dynamic and evolving circumstances of COVID-19 on our clinical trial activities, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the timing of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available during the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023. Based on current planning assumptions, if full enrollment completes after the third quarter of 2021, top-line results will not be available by the end of 2022. If top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available after the end of 2022, we will require additional capital to reach top-line results. In any event, we will require substantial additional funding to further advance the imetelstat program, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and conducting the clinical, regulatory and potential commercialization activities necessary to bring imetelstat to market in lower risk MDS and refractory MF. In addition, our ability to commercialize imetelstat in the United States, if regulatory approval is granted, depends on us being able to establish sales and marketing capabilities.\nBecause the outcome of any clinical activities and/or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate whether any development activities we may undertake will succeed, and we may never recoup our investment in any imetelstat development, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations. In addition, our plans and timing expectations will be further delayed or interrupted if COVID-19 pandemic conditions continue unabated, or worsen, creating further limitations on our clinical trial activities. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, timing, magnitude and costs of clinical development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat, including the number of indications being pursued, subject to clearances and approvals by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, duration, results and costs of current and potential future clinical trials, including IMerge Phase 3, IMpactMF and other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments, of imetelstat;\n\u2022\ndelays or disruptions in opening sites, screening and enrolling patients or treating and following patients, in IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF or any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, whether as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reasons;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews or other regulatory actions related to imetelstat, such as obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals for IMpactMF in the United States and in other countries;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nthe costs of manufacturing imetelstat, including our ability to achieve any meaningful reduction in manufacturing costs;\n\u2022\nthe costs of multiple third-party vendors and service providers, including our CROs and CMOs, to pursue the development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish, enforce and maintain collaborative or other strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing and manufacturing of imetelstat and potential future commercialization and marketing;\n\u2022\nour efforts to enhance operational, financial and management processes and systems that will be required for future development and commercialization of imetelstat, and our ability to successfully recruit and retain additional key personnel to support the development and potential future commercialization of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully market and sell imetelstat, if imetelstat receives future regulatory approval or clearance, in the United States and other countries, and the associated costs;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing necessary to build a sales force in the United States to market and sell imetelstat, should it receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe sales price for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nexpenses associated with the pending putative securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits, as well as any other potential litigation;\n\u2022\nthe extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with potential future litigation;\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining and operating facilities in California and New Jersey, telecommunications and administrative oversight, as well as higher expenses for travel when travel becomes possible in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of enabling our personnel to telecommute as required by federal, state and local \u201cshelter in place\u201d or comparable orders, including providing supplies, equipment and technology necessary for them to perform their responsibilities.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds or other support for our development and commercialization efforts. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from imetelstat to finance our cash requirements, which we may never achieve, we expect to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements, which may not be possible. Availability of such financing sources may be negatively impacted with any further delays in reporting results from IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF.\nAdditional financing through public or private debt or equity financings, including pursuant to the 2020 Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., or B. Riley Securities, the Loan Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, and Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, to the extent available, capital lease transactions or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We may be unable to raise equity capital, or may be forced to do so at a stock price or on other terms that could result in substantial dilution of ownership for our stockholders. The receptivity of the public and private debt and equity markets to proposed financings has been substantially affected by uncertainty in the general economic, market and political climate caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may in the future be affected by other factors which are unpredictable and over which we have no control. In this regard, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased market volatility and could result in a significant long-term disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce or eliminate our ability to raise additional funds through financings, and could negatively impact the terms upon which we may raise those funds. If we are unable to raise additional capital or establish alternative collaborative arrangements with third-party collaborative partners for imetelstat, the development of imetelstat may be further delayed, altered or abandoned, which might cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, we may seek additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Due to uncertainty in the general economic, market and political climate, we may determine that it is necessary or appropriate to raise additional funds proactively to meet longer-term anticipated operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that materially and adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. In addition, we have borrowed, and in the future may borrow, additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund imetelstat development and our future growth, including pursuant to our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB or potentially pursuant to new arrangements with different lenders. We may borrow funds on terms under agreements, such as the Loan Agreement, that include restrictive covenants, including covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Moreover, if we raise additional funds through alliance, collaborative or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to imetelstat or our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe cannot assure you that our existing capital resources, future interest income, and potential future sales of our\ncommon stock, including under the 2020 Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities or potential future drawdowns, if available, under our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, will be sufficient to fund our operating plans. In any event, we will continue to need substantial additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements to advance the imetelstat program in clinical development, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and potential commercialization of imetelstat in lower risk MDS and refractory MF, and our need for additional funds may arise sooner than planned. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, if at all, we may be unable to pursue further development, including completing IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, or commencing, conducting or completing other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, or pursuing potential commercialization of imetelstat, which would severely harm our business and we might cease operations.\nWe currently have no source of product revenue and may never become profitable.\nAlthough in the past we have received license and other payments under current and former license and collaboration agreements, we do not currently have any material revenue-generating license or collaboration agreements, have no products approved for commercialization and have never generated any revenue from product sales. In addition, we are incurring and have incurred operating losses every year since our operations began in 1990, except for one. As of December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit was approximately $1.2 billion. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nSubstantially all of our revenues to date have been payments under collaboration agreements and milestones, royalties and other revenues from our licensing arrangements. Our license agreements related to our hTERT technology have expired or been terminated due to expiration of the underlying hTERT patents, and are not expected to generate any further revenues. We have no ongoing collaboration agreement related to imetelstat and have no current plans to enter into any corporate collaboration, partnership or license agreements that result in revenues.\nWe also expect to experience increased negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and imetelstat clinical development activities advance. This will result in decreases in our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Further, we may be unable to replenish our working capital by future financings. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve consistent future profitability. We may never achieve consistent future profitability. Even if we do become profitable in the future, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to achieve consistent future profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and our ability to sustain operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, federal net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage-point cumulative change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, may have resulted in, or other future changes could result in, an ownership change. If a limitation were to apply, utilization of a portion of our domestic net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods. In addition, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities which could adversely impact our financial position. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating loss carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, and may make it more difficult for us to fund our operations.\nUnder the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, drawdowns are available in three tranches, or Tranches A, B and C, subject to certain terms and conditions, including, with respect to Tranche B and Tranche C, achievement of certain clinical, financial and regulatory milestones. Concurrently with the closing of the Loan Agreement, we borrowed $25.0 million of Tranche A, and $10.0 million of Tranche A remains available to be borrowed until June 15, 2021. If we do not achieve the specified clinical, financial and regulatory milestones, we will not be eligible to draw funds under Tranche B and Tranche C of the Loan Agreement, and we may need to obtain additional or alternative financing to advance our development of imetelstat. Such additional or alternative financing may not be available on attractive terms, if at all, and could be more costly for us to obtain. In addition, before we would consider drawing down the remainder of Tranche A and Tranches B and C of the Loan Agreement, if available, we must first satisfy ourselves that we will have access to future alternate sources of capital, such as from the equity capital markets or debt capital markets, in order to repay any additional principal borrowed, which we may be unable to do, in which case, our liquidity and ability to fund our operations may be substantially impaired. As a result, our development of imetelstat could be significantly delayed, which would materially adversely affect our business, business prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAll obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our existing property and assets, excluding intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge. This indebtedness may create additional financing risk for us, particularly if our business or prevailing financial market conditions are not conducive to paying off or refinancing the outstanding debt obligations at maturity. If we borrow the remaining $10.0 million available to us under Tranche A before June 15, 2021 or are able to drawdown any of the other Tranches, our indebtedness will increase, which would further increase our risk of being unable to pay off or refinance our outstanding debt obligations at maturity. Our indebtedness could also have important negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nwe will need to repay the indebtedness by making payments of interest and principal, which will reduce the amount of cash available to finance our operations, our research and development efforts and other general corporate activities; and\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the obligations of our affirmative and restrictive covenants in the Loan Agreement could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would accelerate our obligation to repay this indebtedness, and Hercules and SVB could seek to enforce its security interest in the assets securing such indebtedness.\nTo the extent additional debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described above could increase.\nThe terms of the Loan Agreement place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Loan Agreement imposes operating and other restrictions on us. Such restrictions will affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability and the ability of any future subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\nchange our line of business;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make contributions or repurchase our capital stock; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nThe Loan Agreement also contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a cash balance in an amount greater than or equal to $25.0 million, commencing June 1, 2022, which balance minimum is reduced to $20.0 million upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones. If we enter into certain licensing transactions, this cash covenant requirement would increase to $30.0 million. The breach of any of these restrictive covenants or any other terms of the Loan Agreement would accelerate our obligation to repay our indebtedness under the Loan Agreement, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, business prospects and financial position.\nWe may not have cash available in an amount sufficient to enable us to make interest or principal payments on our indebtedness when due.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and ability to raise additional sources of cash, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring our debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. If we desire to refinance our indebtedness, our ability to do so will depend on the capital and lending markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nFailure to satisfy our current and future debt obligations under the Loan Agreement could result in an event of default. In addition, the Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants and other events of default, the occurrence and continuance of which provide the Hercules and SVB with the right to demand immediate repayment of all principal and unpaid interest under the Loan Agreement, and to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the Loan Agreement. These events of default include, among other things:\n\u2022\ninsolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar events;\n\u2022\nfailure to observe any covenant or secured obligation under the Loan Agreement, which failure, in most cases, is not cured within 15 days;\n\u2022\noccurrence of an event that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect;\n\u2022\nmaterial misrepresentations;\n\u2022\noccurrence of any default under any other agreement involving indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, or the occurrence of a default under any agreement that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us; and\n\u2022\ncertain money judgments being entered against us or any portion of our assets are attached or seized.\nIn the event of default, Hercules and SVB could accelerate all of the amounts due under the Loan Agreement. Under such circumstances, we may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay such indebtedness at the time of such acceleration. In that case, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate imetelstat development or potential commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop and market imetelstat. Hercules and SVB could also exercise their rights to take possession and dispose of the collateral securing the Loan Agreement, which collateral includes substantially all of our property other than intellectual property. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these events.\nRisks Related to Managing Our Growth and Other Business Operations\nWe may be unable to successfully retain or recruit key personnel to support the development and potential future commercialization of imetelstat or to otherwise successfully manage our growth.\nOur ability to successfully develop imetelstat in the future and to potentially commercialize imetelstat depends to a significant extent on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and key members of our staff. In addition, we need to recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional personnel with expertise and experience in clinical science, biostatistics, clinical operations, pharmacovigilance, quality, manufacturing, regulatory affairs, medical affairs, legal affairs, sales, and marketing, to enable us to further develop and potentially commercialize imetelstat.\nWe face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and other research institutions, and competition in our geographic regions is particularly intense. The substantial risks and uncertainties related to our development and potential commercialization of imetelstat and the risks and uncertainties regarding our future business viability, could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel. We may also face higher than expected personnel costs in order to attract new management or development personnel, or to maintain our current management\nand personnel. If we are unable to successfully retain, motivate and incentivize our existing personnel, or to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified management and senior development personnel in the future on acceptable terms, our ability to further develop imetelstat will be impaired, and our business and the price of our common stock would be adversely impacted. As a result of \u201cshelter in place\u201d and similar orders related to COVID-19, as well our own policies, our personnel are currently performing their duties in multiple jurisdictions, and if we are unable or fail to comply with employment, tax, benefits and other laws in such jurisdictions, we may face penalties, fines or litigation. Further, if members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties or have limited availability due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy and/or our operations may be negatively impacted.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize imetelstat will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. Our management may have to divert financial and other resources, as well as devote a substantial amount of time, to managing growth activities, such as enhancing operational, financial and management processes and systems. If we do not effectively manage the expansion of our operations, we could experience weaknesses in our infrastructure and ability to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and regulations, operational mistakes or shortcomings, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The expansion of our operations also could lead to significant costs and could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our current operations. Our ineffective performance in managing any such future growth would negatively impact our business prospects.\nAs our operations continue to expand, we expect that we will need to manage new and additional relationships with various service providers, vendors, suppliers and other third parties, as well as a workforce in multiple countries, jurisdictions and locations. We may not successfully manage our imetelstat commercialization and development efforts effectively, including our current and potential future imetelstat clinical trials. If we fail to achieve key development goals, our abilities to grow as a company, and to further develop and potentially commercialize imetelstat, could be prevented or hindered, and our business and business prospects would be severely harmed, which might cause us to cease operations.\nWe expect imetelstat to remain our sole product candidate for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize imetelstat, our business and business prospects would be severely harmed, which might cause us to cease operations.\nOther than imetelstat, we do not currently have any other oncology products or product candidates. As a result, we are and will be wholly reliant upon the development of imetelstat, our sole product candidate, for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize imetelstat, our business and business prospects would be severely harmed, which might cause us to cease operations.\nIf imetelstat is approved for marketing and commercialization and we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will be unable to successfully commercialize imetelstat if and when it is approved.\nAs a company, we have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities or experience. To achieve commercial success for imetelstat, if approved, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization, which would be expensive and time consuming, outsource these functions to other third parties, or use a hybrid model incorporating both of these approaches.\nThere are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of imetelstat for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses, which would be costly.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize imetelstat on our own include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales, marketing, coverage or reimbursement, customer service, medical affairs and other support personnel;\n\u2022\nour inability to equip sales personnel with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them educate physicians regarding the indications we are targeting and imetelstat, if approved;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe inability of reimbursement professionals to negotiate arrangements for formulary access, reimbursement and other acceptance by payors;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary medicines to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u2022\nthe inability to price imetelstat at a sufficient price point to ensure an adequate and attractive level of profitability; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, we will be reliant on the efforts of such third parties, and our sales revenue from sales of imetelstat or the profitability from such sales to us are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell imetelstat ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market imetelstat or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. In entering into third-party marketing or distribution arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of the third parties, and we cannot assure you that such third parties will establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market imetelstat effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing imetelstat.\nIf we are unable to establish potential future collaborative arrangements for imetelstat, we may have to delay, alter or abandon our imetelstat development and commercialization plans.\nWe intend to develop imetelstat broadly for hematologic malignancies, and to potentially commercialize, market and sell imetelstat in the United States. We may seek another collaborative partner or partners, at an appropriate time, to assist us in the potential development and commercialization of imetelstat, especially outside the United States, and to provide funding for such activities. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborative partners, and these potential collaborative arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. Our ability to seek and establish potential collaborative arrangements may be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical trial activities and the resulting delays in reporting any results from IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, as well as the period of the patent term for our intellectual property portfolio and market exclusivity for imetelstat. We may not be able to negotiate collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all. In this regard, collaborative arrangements with third parties may require us to relinquish material rights, including revenue from potential commercialization, or assume material ongoing development obligations that we would have to fund or otherwise support.\nIn any event, we are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any collaborative arrangements because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing collaborative arrangements. Moreover, given the significant risks and uncertainties regarding the future imetelstat development program, potential collaborative partners may be reluctant to enter into new collaborative arrangements with us, or may only be willing to do so on terms that are not favorable to us. As a result, we may not be successful in finding a new collaborative partner or partners on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to negotiate collaborative arrangements, we may have to:\n\u2022\ndelay or curtail the additional development of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nfurther delay or abandon the potential commercialization of imetelstat outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nreduce the scope of potential future sales or marketing activities; or\n\u2022\nincrease our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense, which will require substantial additional capital than our current resources.\nIn order to advance the imetelstat program, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, or to commence, conduct and complete other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, as well as undertaking potential commercialization activities for imetelstat in the United States, we will need to raise substantial additional capital. In addition, if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund imetelstat development or commercialization activities outside the United States, we will be required to substantially increase our personnel resources and we will need to\nobtain substantial further capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise substantial additional capital, we will not be able to advance the imetelstat program, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF or other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, nor will we be able to bring imetelstat to market and generate product revenues. Establishing the infrastructure necessary to further develop, commercialize, market and sell imetelstat worldwide will require substantial resources and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and negatively impact our imetelstat development or commercialization efforts in the United States.\nWe currently have no products approved for commercial sale, and we have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain marketing approvals for any product candidates, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe have never derived any revenue from the sales of any products. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring, developing and securing our technology, undertaking non-clinical studies and clinical trials of imetelstat and past product candidates that we have subsequently discontinued, and engaging in research and development under collaboration agreements. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approvals for commercialization activities, formulate and manufacture commercial-scale products, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, for these and other reasons discussed elsewhere in these risk factors, it is difficult to predict our future success and the viability of our business and the imetelstat program.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims related to clinical trial conduct or claims related to data protection.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products. We may become subject to product liability claims or claims related to clinical trial conduct, including if the use of imetelstat is alleged to have injured patients, such as injuries alleged to arise from any hepatotoxicity or hemorrhagic event associated with the use of imetelstat. We currently have limited clinical trial liability insurance, and we may not be able to maintain this type of insurance for any of our current Phase 3 clinical trials, IMerge or IMpactMF, or this type of insurance may become too expensive for us to afford because of the highly risky and uncertain nature of clinical trials generally and the high cost of insurance for our business activities. We may be unable to obtain or maintain clinical trial insurance in all of the jurisdictions where we conduct current or potential future clinical trials, including IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF. In addition, business liability, product liability and cybersecurity insurance are becoming increasingly expensive, particularly for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and the pool of insurers offering insurance coverage to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is becoming smaller, making it more difficult to obtain insurance for our business activities at a reasonable price, or at all. Being unable to obtain or maintain product liability, clinical trial liability, cybersecurity or other insurance for our business activities in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities would have a material adverse effect on our business, and could cause us to cease our development of imetelstat.\nWe and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in two pending putative securities class action lawsuits and four shareholder derivative lawsuits. These lawsuits, and potential similar or related lawsuits, could result in substantial damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. These lawsuits, and any other lawsuits to which we are subject, will be costly to defend or pursue and are uncertain in their outcome.\nSecurities-related class action lawsuits and/or derivative lawsuits have often been brought against companies, including biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies, that experience volatility in the market price of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because we often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with our product development activities.\nBetween January 23 and March 5, 2020, three putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our officers. One of the lawsuits was voluntarily dismissed on March 19, 2020. The other two lawsuits, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, or the Northern District, were consolidated by the Court on May 14, 2020, and on August 20, 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint. The consolidated class action complaint alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements made by us related to IMbark during the\nperiod from March 19, 2018, to September 26, 2018. The consolidated complaint alleges, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 by failing to disclose facts related to the alleged failure of IMbark to meet the two primary endpoints of the trial, spleen response rate and Total Symptom Score, and that our stock price dropped when such information was disclosed. The plaintiffs in the consolidated class action complaint seek damages and interest, and an award of reasonable costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees. On October 22, 2020, lead plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated class action complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the amended consolidated class action complaint on November 23, 2020. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on February 8, 2021.\nBetween April 23, 2020 and November 12, 2020, four shareholder derivative actions were filed, naming as defendants certain of our current officers and certain current and former board members. Of these actions, or the Derivative Lawsuits, one was filed in the Northern District, one was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and two were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, respectively. The plaintiffs in the Derivative Lawsuits allege breach of fiduciary duty and violations of Section 14 of the Exchange Act, based on the same underlying facts as the consolidated class action lawsuit described above. The plaintiffs seek damages, corporate governance reforms, equitable relief, restitution, and an award of reasonable costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees. All four Derivative Lawsuits have been deferred until 30 days after an order on our motion to dismiss the amended class action complaint in the consolidated class action lawsuit has been made.\nIt is possible that additional lawsuits will be filed, or allegations received from stockholders, with respect to these same or other matters and also naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants. Such lawsuits and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of such lawsuits is necessarily uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of the pending lawsuits and any additional lawsuits, and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with such lawsuits. We currently are not able to estimate the possible cost to us from these matters, as the pending lawsuits are currently at an early stage, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve the pending lawsuits or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. Monitoring, initiating and defending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management, is likely to be expensive and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the settlement or defense of the pending lawsuits and any potential future lawsuits, and we may not prevail in such lawsuits. Additionally, we may not be successful in having any such lawsuits dismissed or settled within the limits of our insurance coverage.\nWe have not established any reserve for any potential liability relating to the pending lawsuits or any potential future lawsuits. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests in the pending lawsuits, or in similar or related litigation, could result in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, our stock price, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to third-party litigation, and such litigation would be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome.\nOur business may bring us into conflict with our licensees, licensors, or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships, or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours. We may experience employment-related disputes as we seek to expand our personnel resources. We may become involved in performance or other disputes with the CROs we have retained to support our imetelstat clinical development activities, or with other third parties such as service providers, vendors, manufacturers, suppliers or consultants, which could result in a further delay or cessation of current and potential future clinical trials and otherwise significantly further delay our ability to develop imetelstat. If we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties, we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us.\nLawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and defense and disposition costs depend upon many unknown factors. Despite the availability of insurance, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with litigation. Lawsuits could result in judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities, or otherwise negatively affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, the inherent uncertainty of such litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price and a decrease in the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to Protecting Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for imetelstat for an adequate amount of time, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to imetelstat, and our ability to successfully commercialize imetelstat may be adversely affected.\nProtection of our proprietary technology is critically important to our business. Our success and the success of our planned future development and commercialization of imetelstat will depend on our ability to protect our technologies and imetelstat through patents and other intellectual property rights. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and extend our patents and maintain trade secrets, both in the United States and in other countries.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and in other countries. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing imetelstat or our technology and/or limit the duration of the patent protection for imetelstat and our technology. In the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and extending our patents and other intellectual property rights or having our licensors maintain the intellectual property rights we have licensed, the value of imetelstat and/or our technologies will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to further develop or potentially commercialize imetelstat.\nWhile we have method-of-use patents that protect the use of our product for the treatment of certain diseases, this type of patent does not prevent a generic competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of our approved use after our composition of matter patents or their patent term extensions have expired. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our approved indications, physicians may prescribe or use these generic products \u201coff-label,\u201d which would result in decreased sales for us.\nLoss or impairment of our intellectual property related to imetelstat might further delay or halt ongoing or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat and any applications for regulatory approval, and therefore further delay or preclude any future development or commercialization of imetelstat by us. Further, if imetelstat is approved for commercial sale, such loss of intellectual property rights could impair our ability to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to imetelstat and therefore result in decreased sales for us. Occurrence of any of these events would materially and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent rights depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the Patent Office, and various governmental patent agencies in other countries require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/or patent applications will have to be paid to the Patent Office and various government patent agencies in other countries over the lifetime of our owned and licensed patents and/or patent applications and any patent rights we may own or license in the future. Maintaining such compliance may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, nonpayment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with imetelstat or similar products, and this circumstance could harm our financial condition, business and business prospects and the future of imetelstat. In addition, if we are responsible for patent prosecution and maintenance of patent rights in-licensed to us, any of the foregoing could expose us to liability to the applicable patent owner.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on imetelstat for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its first effective nonprovisional filing date. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of imetelstat, patents protecting imetelstat (e.g., patents claiming imetelstat and/or components thereof, methods of use, or methods of making) might expire before imetelstat is commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to imetelstat.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent may be eligible for future patent term extension of up to five years under certain circumstances. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any potential marketing approval of imetelstat, one or more of our owned or licensed U.S. patents may be eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar extensions are also available in certain countries and territories outside the United States, such as in Japan and in Europe. If we fail to apply for applicable patent term extensions or adjustments, we will have a more limited time during which we can enforce our granted patent rights. If regulatory approval of imetelstat occurs after a patent has expired in a country that does not allow interim patent term extensions, as is the case in many countries including Europe, we will be unable to obtain any patent term extension of that expired patent, and the scope of our patent rights may be limited. In addition, should we seek such a patent term extension, we may not be granted any such patent term extension and/or the applicable time period of such patent term extension could be less than five years. Moreover, in some countries, including the United States, the scope of protection for claims under such patent term extensions, if any, does not extend to the full scope of the claims but is limited to the product composition as approved. Thus, for example, if we do not receive a patent term extension for our U.S. composition of matter patent for imetelstat, as approved by the regulatory authorities, our U.S. composition of matter patent will expire in 2025. If we do not receive marketing approval and submit a request for patent term extension for our European composition of matter patents for imetelstat before our patents expire in 2024, our European composition of matter patents will expire in 2024. Similarly, if we do not receive marketing approval in certain non-European countries before our composition of matter patents expire in 2024, our composition of matter patents in such countries will expire in 2024. If we do not have sufficient patent life to protect imetelstat, our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat would be materially and adversely affected, which might cause us to cease operations.\nAlso, there are regulations for the listing of patents in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book. If we submit a patent for listing in the Orange Book, the FDA may decline to list the patent, or a manufacturer of generic drugs may challenge the listing. If imetelstat is approved and an appropriate patent covering imetelstat is not listed in the Orange Book or is subsequently removed from the Orange Book, a manufacturer of generic drugs would not be required to provide advance notice to us of any abbreviated new drug application filed with the FDA to obtain permission to sell a generic version of imetelstat. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in U.S. or international patent law or interpretations of such patent laws could diminish the value of our patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our technologies and imetelstat.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions. In particular, legal principles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents in the United States and in other countries are evolving, and the extent to which we will be able to obtain patent coverage to protect our technologies and imetelstat, or enforce or defend issued patents, is uncertain.\nThe United States has enacted and implemented wide-ranging patent reform legislation, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the AIA, signed into law on September 16, 2011. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Depending on actions by Congress, the federal courts, and the Patent Office, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents or patents that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents or patents that we may obtain in the future. Occurrence of these events and/or significant impairment of our imetelstat patent rights would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, which might cause us to cease operations.\nAs a result of the AIA, in March 2013, the United States transitioned to a first-inventor-to-file system under which, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. However, since the publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by at least several months and sometimes several years, we are not able to be certain upon filing that the persons or entities that we name as inventors in our patent applications were the first to invent the inventions disclosed therein, or the first to file patent applications for these inventions. Thus, our ability to protect our patentable intellectual property depends, in part, on our ability to be the first to file patent applications with respect to our inventions or inventions that were developed by Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement and assigned to us for the future development, commercialization and manufacture of imetelstat. As a result, if we are not the first-inventor-to- file, we may not be able to obtain patents for discoveries that we otherwise would consider patentable and that we consider to be significant to the future success of imetelstat. Delay in the filing of a patent application for any purpose, including further development or refinement of an invention, may result in the risk of loss of patent rights.\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit. The impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will not be known for some time, which could lead to a period of uncertainty relating to our ability to obtain and maintain Supplementary Protection Certificates of imetelstat based on our United Kingdom patents and our ability to establish and maintain European trademarks in the United Kingdom. In 2012, the European Union Patent Package, or EU Patent Package, regulations were passed with the goal of providing for a single pan-European Unity Patent, or UP, and a new European Unified Patent Court, or UPC, for litigation of European patents. It is uncertain that implementation of the EU Patent Package will occur. If the EU Patent Package is ratified and in effect, all European patents, including those issued prior to ratification, would by default automatically fall under the jurisdiction of the UPC and allow for the possibility of obtaining pan-European injunctions. Under the EU Patent Package as currently proposed, once the UPC is established, patent holders are permitted to \u201copt out\u201d of the UPC on a patent-by-patent basis, although the time permitted for this opt-out is not yet known. Owners of traditional European patent applications who receive notice of grant after the EU Patent Package is ratified could validate the patent nationally, and file an opt-out demand. The EU Patent Package may increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement or defense of our issued European patents. The full impact on future European patent filing strategy and the enforcement or defense of our issued European patents in member states and/or the UPC is not known.\nChallenges to our owned or licensed patent rights would result in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings that could prevent or limit development of imetelstat.\nOur patents or those patent rights we have licensed, including patent rights that we may seek with respect to inventions made by past or future collaborators, may be challenged through administrative or judicial proceedings, which could result in the loss of important patent rights. For example, where more than one party seeks U.S. patent protection for the same technology in patent applications that are subject to the law before the implementation of the AIA, the Patent Office may declare an interference proceeding in order to ascertain the party to which the patent should be issued. Patent interferences are typically complex, highly contested legal proceedings, subject to appeal. They are usually expensive and prolonged, and can cause significant delay in the issuance of patents. Our pending patent applications or our issued patents, or those we have licensed and may license from others, may be drawn into interference proceedings or be challenged through post-grant review procedures or litigation, any of which could delay or prevent the issuance of patents, or result in the loss of issued patent rights. We may not be able to obtain from our past or future collaborators the information needed to support our patent rights which could result in the loss of important patent rights.\nUnder the AIA, interference proceedings between patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013 have been replaced with other types of proceedings, including derivation proceedings. The AIA also includes post-grant review procedures subjecting U.S. patents to post-grant review procedures similar to European oppositions, such as inter partes review, or IPR, covered business method post-grant reviews and other post-grant reviews. This applies to all of our U.S. patents and those we have licensed and may license from others, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard necessary to invalidate a patent claim in Patent Office proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal court, a third-party could potentially provide evidence in a Patent Office proceeding sufficient for the Patent Office to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third-party could attempt to use the Patent Office procedures to invalidate patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third-party as a defendant in a district court action. U.S. patents owned or licensed by us may therefore be subject to post-grant review procedures, as well as other forms of review and re-examination. In addition, the IPR process under\nthe AIA permits any person, whether they are accused of infringing the patent at issue or not, to challenge the validity of certain patents. As a result, entities associated with hedge funds have challenged valuable pharmaceutical patents through the IPR process. Significant impairment of our imetelstat patent rights would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, which might cause us to cease operations.\nCertain jurisdictions, such as Europe, New Zealand and Australia, permit oppositions to be filed against granted patents or patents proposed to be granted. Because we seek to enable potential global commercialization of imetelstat, securing both proprietary protection and freedom to operate outside of the United States is important to our business. Opposition proceedings require significant time and costs, and if we are unsuccessful or are unable to commit these types of resources to protect our imetelstat patent rights, we could lose our patent rights and we could be prevented or limited in the development and commercialization of imetelstat.\nAs more groups become engaged in scientific research and product development in the areas of telomerase biology and hematologic malignancies, the risk of our patents, or patents that we have in-licensed, being challenged through patent interferences, derivation proceedings, IPRs, post-grant proceedings, oppositions, re-examinations, litigation or other means will likely increase. For example, litigation may arise as a result of our decision to enforce our patent rights against third parties. Challenges to our patents through these procedures would be extremely expensive and time-consuming, even if the outcome was favorable to us. An adverse outcome in a patent dispute could severely harm our ability to further develop or commercialize imetelstat, or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, and might cause us to cease operations, by:\n\u2022\ncausing us to lose patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction(s);\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to litigation, or otherwise preventing us from commercializing imetelstat in the relevant jurisdiction(s);\n\u2022\nrequiring us to obtain licenses to the disputed patents;\n\u2022\nforcing us to cease using the disputed technology; or\n\u2022\nrequiring us to develop or obtain alternative technologies.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patents on imetelstat and our technologies in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States are less extensive than those in the United States. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries; thus, even in countries where we do pursue patent protection, there can be no assurance that any patents will issue with claims that cover imetelstat and our technologies. There can be no assurance that we will obtain or maintain patent rights inside or outside the United States. under any future license agreements. In addition, the laws of some countries outside the United States do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, even in jurisdictions where we pursue patent protection, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not pursued and obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with imetelstat and our technologies and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the United States. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and pharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. For example, many countries outside the United States have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights, even if obtained, in jurisdictions outside the United States could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not\nissuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. While we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in major markets for imetelstat, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market imetelstat. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop.\nWe may be subject to infringement claims that are costly to defend, and such claims may limit our ability to use disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat.\nThe commercial success of imetelstat will depend upon our ability to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell imetelstat without infringing or otherwise violating the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and many pharmaceutical companies, including potential competitors, have substantial patent portfolios. In the event our technologies infringe the rights of others or require the use of discoveries and technologies controlled by third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or other proprietary rights or develop or obtain alternative technologies. For example, we are aware that certain third parties have or may be prosecuting patents and patent estates that may relate to imetelstat, and while we believe these patents will expire before imetelstat is able to be commercialized and/or that these patents are invalid and/or would not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of imetelstat, it is possible that the owner(s) of these patents will assert claims against us in the future. If that were to occur, we might need to obtain unblocking licenses from such third parties, develop alternative non-infringing technologies, which we may not be able to do at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms, or at all, or cease the development of imetelstat. In addition, while our past collaboration agreements have terminated, we are still subject to indemnification obligations to certain collaborators, including with respect to claims of third-party patent infringement.\nSince we cannot be aware of all intellectual property rights potentially relating to imetelstat and its uses, we do not know with certainty that imetelstat, or the intended commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third-party\u2019s intellectual property. Any infringement claims against us would likely be expensive to resolve, and the cost of any unblocking license that we could be required to obtain is unpredictable and could be significant. If we are unable to resolve an infringement claim successfully, we could be subject to an injunction that would prevent us from potentially commercializing imetelstat and could also require us to pay substantial damages. In addition to infringement claims, in the future we may also be subject to other claims relating to intellectual property, such as claims that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of third parties. Provided that we are successful in continuing the development of imetelstat, we expect to see more efforts by others to obtain patents that are positioned to cover imetelstat. Our success therefore depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and the proprietary rights of others.\nWe may become aware of discoveries and technologies controlled by third parties that are advantageous or necessary to further develop or manufacture imetelstat. Under such circumstances, we may initiate negotiations for licenses to other technologies as the need or opportunity arises. We may not be able to obtain a license to a technology required to pursue the research, development, manufacture or commercialization of imetelstat on commercially favorable terms, or at all, or such licenses may be terminated on certain grounds, including as a result of our failure to comply with any material obligations under such licenses. If we do not obtain a necessary license or if such a license is terminated, we may need to redesign such technologies or obtain rights to alternative technologies, which may not be possible, and even if possible, could cause further delays in the development efforts for imetelstat and could increase the development and/or production costs of imetelstat. In cases where we are unable to license necessary technologies, we could be subject to litigation and prevented from pursuing research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat, which would materially and adversely impact our business. Failure by us to obtain rights to alternative technologies or a license to any technology that may be required to pursue research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat would further delay current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat and any applications for regulatory approval, impair our ability to sell imetelstat, if approved, and therefore result in decreased sales of imetelstat for us. Occurrence of any of these events would materially and adversely affect our business, and might cause us to cease operations.\nWe may become involved in disputes with past or future collaborator(s) over intellectual property inventorship, ownership or use, and publications by us, or by investigators, scientific consultants, research collaborators or others. Such disputes could impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which, in either case, could have a significant impact on our business.\nInventions discovered under research, material transfer or other collaboration agreements may become jointly owned by us and the other party to such agreements in some cases, and may be the exclusive property of either party in other cases. Under some circumstances, it may be difficult to determine who invents and owns a particular invention, or whether it is jointly owned, and disputes can arise regarding inventorship, ownership and use of those inventions. These disputes could be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome could have a significant adverse effect on our business if we were not able to protect our license rights to these inventions. In addition, clinical trial investigators, scientific consultants and research collaborators generally have contractual rights to publish data and other proprietary information, subject to review by the trial sponsor. Publications by us, or by investigators, scientific consultants, previous employees, research collaborators or others, either with permission or in contravention of the terms of their agreements with us or without past or future collaborators, may impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect proprietary information which would have a material adverse effect on our business, and might cause us to cease operations.\nMuch of the information and know-how that is critical to our business is not patentable, and we may not be able to prevent others from obtaining this information and establishing competitive enterprises.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology, especially in circumstances in which we believe patent protection is not appropriate or available. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and contractors. However, we cannot provide assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, any of which would harm our business significantly.\nIn May 2016, the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, or the DTSA, was enacted, providing a federal cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets. Under the DTSA, an employer may not collect enhanced damages or attorney fees from an employee or contractor in a trade secret dispute brought under the DTSA, unless certain advanced provisions are observed. We cannot provide assurance that our existing agreements with employees and contractors contain notice provisions that would enable us to seek enhanced damages or attorneys\u2019 fees in the event of any dispute for misappropriation of trade secrets brought under the DTSA.\nRisks Related to Competitive Factors\nIf competitors develop products, product candidates or technologies that are superior to or more cost-effective than imetelstat, this would significantly impact the development and commercial viability of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by intense and dynamic competition with rapidly advancing technologies and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry; experience with the biological mechanisms related to imetelstat, telomeres and telomerase; clinical data to date indicating potential disease-modifying activity with imetelstat treatment; and knowledge and expertise around the development of potential treatments for hematologic myeloid malignancies provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Imetelstat will compete, if approved, with other products and therapies that currently exist, are being developed or will in the future be developed, some of which we may not currently be aware of.\nIf approved for commercial sale for the treatment of lower risk MDS, imetelstat would compete against a number of currently existing therapies, including ESAs and other hematopoietic growth factors that are indicated for anemia; immunomodulators, such as Revlimid (lenalidomide) by Celgene Corporation, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation, or Celgene; hypomethylating agents, such as Vidaza (azacitidine) by Celgene and manufacturers of generic azacitidine; Dacogen (decitabine) by Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. and other manufacturers in the U.S. and Janssen in the EU; Inqovi (oral combination of decitabine and cedazuridine) by Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Reblozyl (luspatercept), a TGF-beta inhibitor, by Acceleron Pharma, Inc., or Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene.\nOther therapies currently in Phase 3 development in lower risk MDS, some of which may obtain regulatory approval earlier than imetelstat include: roxadustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, by FibroGen, Inc.; and APR-246, an activator of p53 protein, by Aprea Therapeutics, Inc.\nIn addition, there are multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of other agents for lower risk MDS, including but not limited to: LB-100, a PP2A inhibitor being developed by Lixte Biotechnology Holdings, Inc.; bemcentinib, an AXL inhibitor being developed by BerGenBio ASA; H3B-8800, a spliceosome inhibitor being developed by H3 Biomedicine, Inc.; and KER-050, a TGF-beta inhibitor being developed by Keros Therapeutics, Inc.\nIf approved for commercial sale for the treatment of MF, imetelstat would compete against currently approved JAK inhibitors: Jakafi (ruxolitinib) by Incyte Corporation and Inrebic (fedratinib) by Celgene. Other treatment modalities for MF include hydroxyurea for the management of splenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and constitutional symptoms; splenectomy and splenic irradiation for the management of splenomegaly and co-existing cytopenias, or low blood cell counts; chemotherapy and pegylated interferon. Drugs for the treatment of MF-associated anemia include ESAs, androgens, danazol, corticosteroids, thalidomide and lenalidomide.\nOther therapies currently in Phase 3 development, some of which may obtain regulatory approval earlier than imetelstat include pacritinib, a JAK inhibitor, by CTI Biopharma; momelotinib, a JAK inhibitor, by Sierra Oncology; pelabresib, a BET inhibitor, by Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; navitoclax, a BCLXL, BCL-2 and BCLW inhibitor, by AbbVie, Inc.; and parsaclisib, a PI3K delta inhibitor, by Incyte Corporation. Other approaches for MF currently under investigation that could compete with imetelstat in the future include luspatercept, a TGF-beta inhibitor, by Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene; PRM-151, an anti-fibrosis antibody, by Promedior, Inc.; LCL 161, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), by Novartis; KRT-232, an inhibitor of MDM2, by Kartos Therapeutics, Inc.; GB2064, a LOXL2 inhibitor, by Galecto Biotech; ING-41, a selective GSK-3b inhibitor, by Actuate Therapeutics, Inc.; XPOVIO (Selinexor), a nuclear export inhibitor, by Karyopharm Therapeutics, Inc.; TL-895, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor by, Telios Pharma, Inc.; IMG7289, a LSD1 inhibitor, by Imago Biosciences, Inc.; and APG-1252, a dual BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor, by Ascentage Pharma.\nSmaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies explore treatments for hematologic myeloid malignancies, which may significantly impact the commercial viability of imetelstat. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to imetelstat. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified development and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to the imetelstat program.\nMany of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, could have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. We believe that the commercial success of imetelstat is subject to a number of factors, including,\n\u2022\nproduct efficacy and safety;\n\u2022\nmethod of product administration;\n\u2022\ncost of manufacturing;\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of regulatory consents;\n\u2022\nstatus of coverage and level of reimbursement;\n\u2022\nlevel of generic competition;\n\u2022\nprice; and\n\u2022\npatent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others.\nAs a result of the foregoing, competitors may develop more commercially desirable or affordable products than imetelstat, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we may be able to achieve with imetelstat. Competitors have developed, or are in the process of developing, technologies that are, or in the future may\nbe, competitive to imetelstat. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing therapeutic effects similar or superior to those that may be demonstrated by imetelstat. Competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, or less costly than imetelstat, or more convenient to administer to patients and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to imetelstat. In addition, competitors may price their products below what we may determine to be an acceptable price for imetelstat, may receive better third-party payor coverage and/or reimbursement, or may be more cost-effective than imetelstat. Such competitive products or activities by competitors may render imetelstat obsolete, which may cause us to cease any further development or future commercialization of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nTo be commercially successful, imetelstat must be accepted by the health care community, which can be very slow to adopt or unreceptive to new technologies and products.\nIf approved for marketing, imetelstat may not achieve market acceptance, or the potential worldwide or U.S. revenue we believe may be possible, since hospitals, physicians, patients or the medical community in general may decide not to accept and utilize imetelstat. If approved for commercial sale, imetelstat will compete with a number of conventional and widely accepted drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies. The degree of market acceptance of imetelstat will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which imetelstat is approved, if any;\n\u2022\nthe country and/or regions within which imetelstat is approved, if any;\n\u2022\nthe establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe ability to demonstrate that imetelstat is superior to alternatives on the market at the time;\n\u2022\nthe ability to establish in the medical community the potential advantages of imetelstat over alternative treatment methods, including with respect to efficacy, safety, cost or route of administration;\n\u2022\nthe publication of unfavorable safety or efficacy data concerning imetelstat by third parties or us;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on use of imetelstat in combination with other products;\n\u2022\nthe label and promotional claims allowed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for imetelstat, if any, including usage for only certain indications and any limitations or warnings about the prevalence or severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of imetelstat as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales, marketing and distribution support for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which imetelstat is approved for inclusion on formularies in hospitals and managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by government and third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage by third-party payors, including governmental authorities.\nThe established use of conventional products competitive with imetelstat may limit or preclude the potential for imetelstat to receive market acceptance upon any commercialization. We may be unable to demonstrate any pharmacoeconomic advantage for imetelstat compared to established or standard-of-care therapies, or newly developed therapies, for hematologic myeloid malignancies. Third-party payors may decide that any potential improvement that imetelstat may provide to clinical outcomes in hematologic myeloid malignancies is not adequate to justify the costs of treatment with imetelstat. If the health care community does not accept imetelstat for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reasons, our ability to further develop or potentially commercialize imetelstat may be negatively impacted or precluded altogether, which would seriously and adversely affect our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for imetelstat is not obtained, the use of imetelstat could be severely limited.\nThe ability to successfully commercialize imetelstat, if approved, will depend significantly on obtaining acceptable prices and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to the patient from third-party payors. Government payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and the reimbursement levels. Assuming we obtain coverage for imetelstat by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. If imetelstat is approved for commercial sale, patients are unlikely to use it unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of its cost. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement will be critical to new product acceptance.\nGovernment authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices as a condition of coverage, are using restrictive formularies and preferred drug lists to leverage greater discounts in competitive classes, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of imetelstat to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nWe cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for imetelstat, if approved for commercial sale, and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. There may also be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which marketing approval is obtained. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize imetelstat, even if marketing approval is obtained, which would negatively impact our business and business prospects.\nThe adoption of health policy changes and health care reform in the United States may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn the United States and some jurisdictions outside the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could impact our business. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law in March 2020. The CARES Act is aimed at providing emergency assistance and health care for individuals, families and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and generally supporting the U.S. economy. Generally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing, including specialty drug pricing practices, in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Specifically, there have been U.S. Congressional inquiries and federal and state legislative activity designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the price of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs and biologics. While a number of reform measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could affect pricing for imetelstat if it is approved. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may introduce temporary or permanent healthcare reform measures, which could have negative financial implications on our business.\nIf future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business and financial results. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biologic product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk\npurchasing. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on future worldwide sales of imetelstat, if approved. For a discussion of health reform activity, see Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCost control initiatives also could decrease the price that we may receive for imetelstat in the future. If imetelstat is not considered cost-effective or adequate third-party reimbursement for the users of imetelstat cannot be obtained, then we may be unable to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in imetelstat. Any of these events would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf we fail to comply with federal, state and international healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse, transparency, and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback and false claims laws; data privacy and security laws; and transparency laws related to payments and/or other transfers of value made to physicians, other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute any product of ours for which marketing approval is obtained. For details regarding the restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate see Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation- Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare, privacy and data security laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. For example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process or control compared to prior EU law, including in clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management\u2019s attention and increase our cost of doing business. Likewise, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, such as the CCPA, which has been characterized as the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d privacy statute enacted in the United States because it mirrors a number of the key provisions in the GDPR, became effective on January 1, 2020, and we cannot determine the impact such laws, regulations and standards will have on our business. In any event, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidances or case law involving applicable healthcare or privacy laws, including the GDPR, in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations.\nFederal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other healthcare and privacy-related regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, clinical trial sites, contract research organizations, consultants or vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, clinical trial sites, contract research organizations, consultants or vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the FDA\u2019s or other regulatory authorities\u2019 regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information; manufacturing standards; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Specifically, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements.\nActivities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished potential profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Financial Reporting\nHistorically, our stock price has been extremely volatile.\nHistorically, our stock price has been extremely volatile. Between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2020, our stock has traded as high as $7.79 per share and as low as $0.75 per share. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the price has ranged between a high of $2.40 per share and a low of $0.75 per share. The significant market price fluctuations of our common stock have been due to and may in the future be influenced by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the research and development of imetelstat, or results of, further delays in the commencement, enrollment or conduct of, discontinuation of, or further modifications or refinements to any clinical trials of imetelstat, including IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF, for any reason, or our inability, for any reason, to successfully continue the development of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nhaving sufficient financial resources to reach top-line results in IMerge Phase 3;\n\u2022\nobtaining substantial additional capital, on commercially reasonable terms, necessary to advance the imetelstat program, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and conducting the clinical, regulatory and potential commercialization activities necessary to bring imetelstat to market in lower risk MDS and refractory MF;\n\u2022\npreliminary, interim or final clinical trial data reported with respect to current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and investor perceptions thereof;\n\u2022\nnot receiving timely regulatory clearances or approvals in any jurisdiction, whether within or outside of the United States, including, if we do not obtain regulatory clearance to commence, modify, conduct or continue clinical trials of imetelstat in MF, MDS or any additional hematologic myeloid malignancies in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the safety of imetelstat and partial or full clinical holds placed on the imetelstat INDs by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or other regulatory developments related to imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe experimental nature of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any future collaboration agreements for the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat that we may establish;\n\u2022\nthe demand in the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new commercial products, or clinical progress or lack thereof by us, potential future collaborative partners or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nincreased or continuing operating losses;\n\u2022\ngeneral domestic and international market conditions or market conditions relating to the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries, especially given the volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nperceptions of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislature, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning imetelstat proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ncomments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles and other media;\n\u2022\nlarge stockholders exiting their position in our common stock or an increase in the short interest in our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of or developments concerning pending and potential future litigation;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of common stock to partners, vendors or investors to raise additional capital; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of any other risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nStock prices and trading volumes for many biopharmaceutical companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons, including factors which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations, such as media coverage, statements made on message boards and social media forums, legislative and regulatory measures and the activities of various interest groups or organizations. In addition to the risk factors described in this section, overall market volatility, as well as general domestic or international economic, market and political conditions, including those resulting from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the return on our stockholders\u2019 investment in our securities.\nIn addition, as further discussed in the Risk Factor above entitled \u201cWe and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in two pending putative securities class action lawsuits and four shareholder derivative lawsuits. These lawsuits, and potential similar or related lawsuits, could result in substantial damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. These lawsuits, and any other lawsuits to which we are subject, will be costly to defend or pursue and are uncertain in their outcome\u201d, we and two of our officers have been named as defendants in two putative class action lawsuits. In addition, certain of our current officers and current and former board members have been named as defendants in the Derivative Lawsuits filed in the Northern District, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and the District Court for the District of Delaware, respectively. Such lawsuits have often been instituted against companies, including us, whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. The pending lawsuits and any lawsuits brought against us in the future could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and results of operations and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could result in delays of IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and/or could preclude or delay potential future clinical trials, or could preclude or delay commercialization efforts.\nWe may fail to continue to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, and as a result our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock currently trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on Nasdaq. In particular, Nasdaq rules require us to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share of our common stock. On March 12, 2020, the closing price of our common stock was $0.99 per share, and while the closing price of our common stock rose to $1.03 per share on\nMarch 19, 2020, and has subsequently remained at or above the minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share from March 19, 2020 through the date of this filing, it may in the future fall below the closing minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. If the closing bid price of our common stock were to remain below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, or we do not meet other listing requirements, we would fail to be in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards. There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or any other requirement in the future. If we fail to meet the minimum bid price requirement once the temporary suspension is lifted, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC may initiate the delisting process with a notification letter. If we were to receive such a notification, we would be afforded a grace period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of our common stock would need to maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders\u2019 equity or market values of our common stock, in which case our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 450,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance and 310,566,853 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, we had reserved 118,156,885 shares of our common stock for future issuance pursuant to our option and equity incentive plans and outstanding warrants as of December 31, 2020.\nFuture sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur, or the issuance of common stock to fund our operations and imetelstat development, including pursuant to the 2020 Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, could cause immediate dilution and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The sale or issuance of our securities, as well as the existence of outstanding options and shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our option and equity incentive plans and outstanding warrants, also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment.\nOur undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids; this may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors with the authority to issue up to 3,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imported upon these shares without further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if in the future, we issue preferred stock that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our charter, bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us, which may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they believe may be the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers.\nProvisions of our charter documents and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management, including provisions that:\n\u2022\nprevent stockholders from taking actions by written consent;\n\u2022\ndivide the board of directors into separate classes with terms of office that are structured to prevent all of the directors from being elected in any one year; and\n\u2022\nset forth procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders\u2019 meetings.\nProvisions of Delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations. In addition, we have individual severance agreements with our executive officers and a company-wide severance plan, either of which could require a potential acquirer to pay a higher price. Either collectively or individually, these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers, including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws; or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nWhile the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws do not apply to lawsuits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, these provisions may nonetheless limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business and our financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, the terms of our Loan Agreement prevent us from paying dividends and any future debt agreements may continue to preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nRISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, DATA SECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business and information technology practices, including the requirement that our employees work remotely and not in our offices. Our information technology systems, including in our remote work environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and those of our collaborators, service providers and contractors, are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, data corruption, malicious intrusion, malware, computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures that may result in damage to or the impairment of key business processes, or the unauthorized, unlawful or accidental loss, corruption, access, acquisition or disclosure of confidential information, such as clinical trial data or information, intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\noperations. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures designed to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. In addition, we rely on our collaborators, service providers, including our CROs, and contractors to establish and maintain appropriate information technology systems and data security protections. However, except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control their safeguards and actions related to such matters. If such a breach were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our imetelstat development program. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in obtaining, or our inability to obtain, regulatory approvals and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nIn addition, our information technology systems, as well as those of our collaborators, service providers and contractors, are potentially vulnerable to security breaches, whether by employees, contractors, consultants, malware, phishing attacks, or other cyber-attacks, that may expose confidential information, intellectual property, proprietary business information or personal information to unauthorized persons. If a security breach affects our systems or those of third parties upon which we rely, corrupts our data or results in the unauthorized disclosure or release of personal information by our collaborators, service providers, contractors or us, our reputation could be materially damaged, and we could be subject to significant fines, increased costs or loss of revenue. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, supervisory bodies, credit reporting agencies, the media, individuals, collaborators or other relevant stakeholders pursuant to various federal. state and foreign data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and guidelines, as well as contracts, if applicable. These may include state data breach notification laws and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR. Accordingly, a data security breach or privacy violation that leads to unauthorized access to, acquisition, disclosure or modification of personal information (including health information), that prevents access to personal information or materially compromises the privacy, security, availability, integrity or confidentiality of the personal information, could result in processing penalties, fines, increased costs or loss of revenue as a result of:\n\u2022\nharm to our reputation;\n\u2022\nadditional compliance obligations or enforcement measures under U.S. federal and state laws, and foreign laws;\n\u2022\nremediation and corrective action we undertake as required by law or as otherwise necessary;\n\u2022\nlitigation and potential civil or criminal liability; and\n\u2022\nrequirements to verify the accuracy of affected data.\nMany of our contracts with relevant stakeholders such as collaborators include obligations to use industry-standard or reasonable measures to safeguard personal information. A security breach could lead to claims against us by relevant stakeholders. In addition, our non-compliance with our data privacy obligations in our contracts, or our inability to ensure that our service providers also comply with such obligations to relevant stakeholders, may cause us to breach our contracts. As a result, we could be subject to legal action or the relevant stakeholders could end their relationships with us. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages.\nIf we are unable to prevent data security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive study participant data. In addition, breaches and other compromises of our data can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access our information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect our information technology systems, because the techniques used to compromise our systems, obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently, become more sophisticated, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our collaborators, service providers or contractors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to data security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nChanges in and failures to comply with United States federal and state as well as foreign privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidances, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal data, such as information that we collect about study subjects and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the United States and abroad. These laws, regulations and guidances may change, are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions or conflict. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or our collaborators\u2019, service providers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer, use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and guidances is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our collaborators, service providers and contractors to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulation, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings (including investigations) against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.\nIn the United States, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective in January 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA, in part, requires covered businesses to provide new disclosures to California residents and provide such residents new ways to opt-out of certain disclosures of personal information. In addition, the CCPA provides a private right action for data breaches, which is expected to increase data breach litigation. It is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, will expand the CCPA on January 1, 2023 when the CPRA becomes operative. These laws exemplify the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data. As we expand our operations, these and similar laws may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws.\nOur operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from foreign data protection authorities. Many foreign jurisdictions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our collaborators, service providers, including our CROs, contractors and other relevant stakeholders must comply. For example, the EU adopted the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal information of EU residents, including clinical trial data. The GDPR has and will continue to increase compliance burdens on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and process information about them. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as physical health conditions, may impose heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. In addition, the GDPR provides for more robust regulatory enforcement such as data processing penalties and monetary fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. As we expand into countries and jurisdictions outside the United States, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nEuropean data protection laws, including the GDPR, generally restrict the transfer of personal information from Europe, including the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (U.K.) and Switzerland, to the United States and most other countries unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal information. For example, we became originally Privacy Shield certified by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s International Trade Administration in April 2019. However, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield on July 16, 2020 and similarly, on September 8, 2020, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner declared the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate to protect the transferred personal data. Nonetheless, the U.S. Department of Commerce continues to administer the Privacy Shield program to maintain the Privacy Shield Frameworks and we continue to be bound by the Privacy Shield obligations. The same CJEU decision also raised questions about whether one of the primary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely, the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses, can lawfully be used for personal information transfers from Europe to the United States or most other countries. Authorities in the U.K. may\nsimilarly invalidate use of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and raise questions on the viability of the Standard Contractual Clauses as mechanisms for lawful personal information transfers from the United Kingdom to the United States. At present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Standard Contractual Clauses. Although we rely primarily on clinical trial participants\u2019 explicit consent to transfer their personal information from Europe to the United States and other countries, in certain cases we have relied on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Standard Contractual Clauses. As such, if we are unable to rely on explicit consent to transfer individuals\u2019 personal information from Europe, which can be revoked, or implement another valid compliance mechanism, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions against processing or transferring personal information from Europe. Inability to import personal information from Europe to the United States or other countries may also limit our ability conduct clinical trial activities in Europe; collaborate with other entities subject to European data protection laws; and require us to increase our data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense. In November 2020, EU regulators proposed a new set of Standard Contractual Clauses, which impose additional obligations and requirements with respect to the transfer of EU personal data to other jurisdictions, which may increase the legal risks and liabilities under the GDPR and local EU laws associated with cross-border data transfers, and result in material increased compliance and operational costs. Moreover, other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business.\nIn addition, it is unclear whether the transfer of personal information from the EU to the U.K. will continue to remain lawful under the GDPR in light of Brexit. Pursuant to a post-Brexit trade deal between the U.K. and the EU, transfers of personal information from the EEA to the U.K. are not considered restricted transfers under the GDPR for a period of up to four months from January 1, 2021 with a potential two-month extension. However, unless the EU Commission makes an adequacy finding with respect to the U.K. before the end of that period, the U.K. will be considered a \u201cthird country\u201d under the GDPR and transfers of European personal information to the U.K. will require an adequacy mechanism to render such transfers lawful under the GDPR. Additionally, although U.K. privacy, data protection and data security laws are designed to be consistent with the GDPR, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated notwithstanding Brexit.\nWe publish privacy policies and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use and disclosure of personal information. Although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and other documentation, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, collaborators, contractors, service providers or vendors fail to act in accordance with our published policies and documentation. Such failures can subject us to potential foreign, local, state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Moreover, trial participants or research subjects about whom we or our partners obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may contractually limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights or failed to comply with data protection laws or applicable privacy notices, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nCompliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the such data protection obligations. If we fail to comply with any data protection obligations, we may face significant fines, penalties and litigation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk FACTORs\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could affect the tax treatment of our domestic and foreign earnings. Any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial condition. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the Tax Act significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Future guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may adversely affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation with adverse effect on us. For example, the CARES Act modified certain provisions of the Tax Act. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what\nextent various states will conform to the Tax Act, the CARES Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our U.S. operations, the taxation of earnings from other countries, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act or future tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Our annual reports on Form 10-K must contain an annual assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must provide an opinion annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe requirements of Section 404 are ongoing and also apply to future years. We expect that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve as our business develops. Although we are committed to continue to improve our internal control processes and we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with Section 404 requirements, any control system, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Therefore, we cannot assure you that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered in the future, particularly in light of our increased reliance on personnel working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If material weaknesses or other significant deficiencies occur, such weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.", "PERMNO": 83756, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GERN"}
