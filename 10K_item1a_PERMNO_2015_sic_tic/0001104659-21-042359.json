RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. However, for the reasons described below, we do not believe that cash on hand and cash flow generated internally by us will be adequate to fund our limited overhead and other cash requirements beyond the next twelve months. These reasons raise significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our significant net losses, working capital deficit and need to raise additional capital, which as it noted raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nDelfin Midstream LLC (\u201cDelfin\u201d), the Company\u2019s majority stockholder, has continued to fund the Company through loans to the Company. See the section of this annual report entitled \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d At December 31, 2020, the Company had a net working capital deficit of approximately $707,000. This deficit included accrued expenses of approximately $24,000, accounts payable of approximately $2,000 and approximately $689,000 in principal and accrued interest owed under the Promissory Note with Delfin.\nOn a short term liquidity basis, we must receive capital contributions or loans from Delfin or its affiliates in order to continue as a going concern. We prefer to avoid filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, based upon our current financial condition as discussed above, we believe that we will need to raise additional debt or equity capital in order for us to continue to operate as a going concern on a long-term basis. Any such capital would likely come from Delfin, as we currently have no access to credit facilities and have traditionally relied on borrowings from related parties to meet short-term liquidity needs. Any equity capital raised may result in substantial dilution in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d). We intend to use the proceeds from the 2018 Promissory Note and seek other loans from Delfin and related entities, if necessary, to fund our public company operating costs while we explore our options related to the future of theglobe.\nThrough December 2020, we borrowed a total of $600,000 under an amended and restated promissory note from Delfin, which was increased to $637,500 in February 2021.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its impact on debt and equity markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to operate as a going concern.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout other parts of the world, including the United States. The outbreak of the coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis and has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, business operations and the conduct of commerce generally. In particular, the global capital markets are experiencing and may continue to experience periods of disruption and instability, which could be prolonged and which could materially and adversely impact the broader financial and credit markets. Such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, which in turn could impact our ability to operate as a going concern beyond the next twelve months\nOur management may have other interests that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders.\nMr. Jones became our Chief Executive Officer in 2018. Mr. Jones currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Fairwood, which is a material stockholder of Delfin, our controlling stockholder. Mr. Jones is a material stockholder of Delfin and also maintains directorships, investments and participations with and in other companies and entities, including those that may be involved in the gas and/or energy business. Although there are currently no relationships between the Company and these entities, Mr. Jones, due to his relationship with such entities, will have an inherent conflict of interest in making any decision related to transactions between the related entities and the Company. Furthermore, since Mr. Jones is also the sole member of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), our Board presently is not \u201cindependent.\u201d In the event that we have independent directors in the future, we intend to review related party transactions on a case-by-case basis.\nWe currently have no business operations and are a shell company.\nImmediately following the closing of the Tralliance Purchase Transaction, we became a shell company with no material operations or assets, and no source of revenue other than under the \u201cnet revenue\u201d earn-out arrangement with Tralliance Registry Management. We expect that our future operating expenses as a public shell company will consist primarily of customary public company expenses, including legal, audit and other miscellaneous public company costs which will need to be paid by Delfin. In addition, our lack of operations, assets and current prospects makes it difficult for investors to evaluate our future performance.\nWe may require additional financing to maintain our reporting requirements and administrative expenses.\nWe have no meaningful revenues and are dependent on our cash on hand to fund the costs associated with the reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, and other administrative costs associated with our corporate existence. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $163,836 and $211,374, respectively. General and administrative expenses include customary public company expenses, including outside legal and audit fees, insurance and other related public company costs. We do not expect to generate any revenues unless and until we commence business operations. In the past, we relied on funding from affiliated creditors and we may need additional funding beyond those sources to continue as a going concern. In the event that our available funds prove to be insufficient, we will be required to seek additional financing. Our failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay the legal and audit fees and other administrative costs in order to continue to fulfill our reporting obligations. We do not have any arrangements with any bank or financial institution to secure additional financing and such financing may not be available on terms acceptable and in our best interests, if at all.\nWe may suffer adverse consequences if we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Act of 1940 and we may incur significant costs to avoid investment company status.\nWe do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company\u201d as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940. If the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or a court were to disagree with us, we could be required to register as an investment company. This would negatively affect our ability to consummate a potential acquisition of an operating company, subjecting us to disclosure and accounting guidance geared toward investment, rather than operating companies; limiting our ability to borrow money, issue options, issue multiple classes of stock and debt, and engage in transactions with affiliates; and requiring us to undertake significant costs and expenses to meet disclosure and regulatory requirements to which we would be subject as a registered investment company.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe are controlled by our majority stockholder, which may limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence future corporate action.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our majority stockholder, Delfin Midstream LLC, holds approximately 70.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock. Accordingly, Delfin continues to be in a position to control the vote on all corporate actions in the future.\nThe delisting of our Common Stock makes it more difficult for investors to sell shares.\nThe shares of our Common Stock were delisted from the NASDAQ national market in April 2001 and are now traded in the over-the-counter market on what is commonly referred to as the electronic bulletin board or \u201cOTCBB.\u201d As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the securities, if at all. The delisting has made trading our shares more difficult for investors. It has also made it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. We may also incur additional costs under state blue-sky laws if we sell equity due to our delisting.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock and, consequently, the ability of our stockholders to achieve a return on their investment in our Common Stock will depend on appreciation in the price of our Common Stock.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock. Any future dividend payment is within the absolute discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our Common Stock. As a result, the success of an investment in our Common Stock will depend on future appreciation in its value. The price of our Common Stock may not appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased shares. If our Common Stock does not appreciate in value, investors could suffer losses in their investment in our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is subject to certain \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules which may make it a less attractive investment.\nSince the trading price of our Common Stock is less than $5.00 per share and our net tangible assets are less than $2.0 million, trading in our Common Stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. Under Rule 15g-9, brokers who recommend penny stocks to persons who are not established customers and accredited investors, as defined in the Exchange Act, must satisfy special sales practice requirements, including requirements that they make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser; and receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent prior to the transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 also requires additional disclosures in connection with any trades involving a penny stock, including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with that market. Such requirements may severely limit the market liquidity of our Common Stock and the ability of purchasers of our equity securities to sell their securities in the secondary market. For all of these reasons, an investment in our equity securities may not be attractive to our potential investors.\nAs a shell company, we are subject to more stringent reporting requirements.\nWe have no or nominal operations and assets, and pursuant to Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, we are a shell company. Applicable securities rules prohibit shell companies from using a Form S-8 to register securities pursuant to employee compensation plans. However, the rules do not prevent us from registering securities pursuant to certain other registration statements. Additionally, Form 8-K requires shell companies to provide more detailed disclosure upon completion of a transaction that causes it to cease being a shell company. To the extent we acquire a business in the future, we must file a current report on Form 8-K containing the information required in a registration statement on Form 10, within four business days following completion of the transaction together with financial information of the private operating company. In order to assist the SEC in the identification of shell companies, we are also required to check a box on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K indicating that we are a shell company. To the extent that we are required to comply with additional disclosure because we are a shell company, we may be delayed in executing any mergers or acquiring other assets that would cause us to cease being a shell company.\nRule 144 is not generally available to holders of our Common Stock which makes it difficult to resell shares in the future.\nWith limited exceptions related to restrictive securities acquired before we became a \u201cshell company,\u201d holders of our restricted securities are limited in their ability to resell their securities pursuant to Rule 144. Preclusion from the use of the resale exemption from registration afforded by Rule 144 may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future, and for stockholders to resell their restricted securities.\nOur need for capital may create additional risks and create dilution to existing stockholders.\nAs mentioned above, we will need to raise additional capital in the future, which may be funded from unrelated third party sources, including the incurring of debt and/or the sale of additional equity securities. In addition, we may require additional financing to fund working capital and operating losses in the future should the need arise. The incurrence of debt creates additional financial leverage and therefore an increase in the financial risk of our operations. The sale of additional equity securities may be dilutive to the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, whether debt or equity, will be available to us or that it will be available on acceptable commercial terms. Any inability to secure such additional financing on acceptable terms could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.", "PERMNO": 86436, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "TGLO"}
