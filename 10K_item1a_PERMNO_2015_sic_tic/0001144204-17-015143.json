RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Report. If any of the events described below actually occurs, the Company's business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe success of our Take Shape For Life\u00ae business is dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our network of Health Coaches.\nSales in our Take Shape For Life\u00ae business unit are generated by our independent contractor Health Coaches. The business unit is subject to high turnover and we depend on our network of Health Coaches to continually grow their businesses by attracting, training and motivating new Health Coaches. We consider our number of Health Coaches and revenue per Health Coach to be key indicators of our success in the Take Shape For Life\u00ae business unit. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company had 12,500 active Health Coaches and the average revenue per Health Coach was $4,158. If we fail to provide the tools and competitive compensation necessary to promote Health Coaches to grow their businesses, we believe these key indicators will weaken and our revenue will decline.\nThe growth and sustainability of our network of Health Coaches is also subject to risk factors which may be outside of our control. These include:\n\u00b7 Negative public perceptions of multi-level marketing;\n\u00b7 General economic conditions;\n\u00b7 Failure to develop innovative products to meet consumer demands\n\u00b7 Adverse opinions of our products, services, or industry; and\n\u00b7 Regulatory actions against our company, competitors in our industry, or other direct selling companies.\nOur future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to advertise.\nOur business success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers, which significantly depends on our marketing practices. In 2016, 2015 and 2014 our marketing expenditures were $9.4 million, $15.3 million and $17.0 million, respectively. Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:\n\u00b7 create greater awareness of our brand and our program;\n\u00b7 identify the most effective and efficient levels of spending in each market, media and specific media vehicle;\n\u00b7 determine the appropriate creative messages and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures;\n\u00b7 effectively manage marketing costs (including creative and media) in order to maintain acceptable customer acquisition costs;\n\u00b7 acquire cost-effective television advertising;\n\u00b7 select the most effective markets, media and specific media vehicles in which to advertise; and\n\u00b7 convert consumer inquiries into actual orders.\nOur planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness. We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our customer acquisition costs may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.\nOur sales may be adversely impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.\nOur results of operation are highly dependent on product sales and program fees. A downturn in general economic conditions, such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown, may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales. For example, economic forces, including general economic conditions, demographic trends, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending, may cause consumers to defer or decrease purchases of our products and programs which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and/or our overall financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with a majority of the products we sell and we manufacture the remaining portion. The inability to obtain the necessary product from our third-party manufacturers or to produce products could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to supply approximately 57% of the food and other products we sell. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food and other products in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of the Medifast brand.\nTherefore, we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with these manufacturers. The services we require from these parties may be disrupted due to a number of factors associated with their businesses, including the following:\n\u00b7 labor disruptions;\n\u00b7 delivery problems;\n\u00b7 financial condition or results of operations;\n\u00b7 internal inefficiencies;\n\u00b7 equipment failure\n\u00b7 severe weather;\n\u00b7 fire;\n\u00b7 nature or man-made disasters;\n\u00b7 shortages of ingredients; and\n\u00b7 USDA or FDA compliance issues.\nWe manufacture approximately 43% of the food and other products we sell. As a result we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our sole manufacturing facility in Owings Mills, Maryland. The operations at this facility may be disrupted by a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 labor disruptions;\n\u00b7 power failures;\n\u00b7 equipment failure;\n\u00b7 internal inefficiencies;\n\u00b7 severe weather;\n\u00b7 fire;\n\u00b7 nature or man-made disasters; and\n\u00b7 USDA or FDA compliance issues.\nThere can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operation problems at our sole facility would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our Health Coaches are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.\nOur Health Coaches are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to provide the same level of oversight as we would if Health Coaches were our own employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that our Health Coaches will comply with our policies and procedures despite our internal compliance efforts. Additionally, some of our Health Coaches do not have extensive training or certification in nutrition, diet or health fields and have only undergone the training they receive from us. We may be subject to claims from our customers alleging that our Health Coaches lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics. We may also be subject to claims that our Health Coaches have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss. Such claims could result in lawsuits, damage to our reputation and divert management's attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe may be subject to health or advertising related claims from our customers.\nOur weight loss program does not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our customers. Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population. A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management program. Further, customers who allege that they were deceived by any statements that we made in advertising or labeling could bring a lawsuit against us under consumer protection laws. Currently, we are neither subject to any such allegations nor have we been named in any such litigation. If we were subject to any such claims, while we would defend ourselves against such claims, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in our defense. Also, defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our brand image, customer loyalty and results of operations.\nThe weight management industry is highly competitive. If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our business could be significantly affected.\nCompetition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition. Our competitors include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements. Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. Our business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management program. For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our business could be significantly affected. Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nNew weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage and our business may suffer.\nThe weight management industry is subject to changing consumer demands based, in large part, on the efficacy and popular appeal of weight management programs. The popularity of weight management programs is dependent, in part, on their ease of use, cost and channels of distribution as well as consumer trends, and, on an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services. The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and \"easier\" than a portion-controlled meal plan would put us at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nIf we do not continue to develop innovative new services and products or if our services and products do not continue to appeal to the market, or if we are unable to successfully expand into new business units of distribution or respond to consumer trends, our business may suffer.\nThe increasing focus of consumers on more integrated lifestyle and fitness approaches rather than just food, nutrition and diet could adversely impact the popularity of our programs. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop and market new, innovative services and products and to enhance our existing services and products, each on a timely basis to respond to new and evolving consumer demands, achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional, weight management, technological and other developments. We may not be successful in developing, introducing on a timely basis or marketing any new or enhanced services and products, and we cannot assure you that any new or enhanced services or products will appeal to the market. Our failure to develop new products and services and to enhance our existing products and services, and the failure of our products and services to continue to appeal to the market could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customers and thus adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to litigation from our competitors.\nOur competitors may pursue litigation against us based on our advertising or other marketing practices regardless of merit and chances of success, especially if we engage in competitive advertising, which includes advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor's weight loss program in comparison to our program. While we would defend ourselves against any such claims, our defense may ultimately be unsuccessful. Also, defending against such claims, regardless of merit and ultimate outcome, may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management's attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.\nAny failure of our technology or systems to perform satisfactorily could result in an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on software, hardware, network systems and similar technology, including cloud-based technology, that is either developed by us or licensed from or maintained by third parties to operate our websites, Online subscription product offerings and other services and products such as the recurring billing system associated with certain of our commitment plans, and to support our business operations. As much of this technology is complex, there may be future errors, defects or performance problems, including when we update our technology or integrate new technology to expand and enhance our capabilities. Our technology may malfunction or suffer from defects that become apparent only after extended use. The integrity of our technology may also be compromised as a result of third-party cyber-attacks, such as hacking, spear phishing campaigns and denial of service (DOS) attacks, which are increasingly negatively impacting companies. In addition, our operations depend on our ability to protect our information technology systems against damage from third-party cyber-attacks, fire, power loss, water, earthquakes, telecommunications failures and similar unexpected adverse events. Interruptions in our websites, services and products or network systems could result from unknown technical defects, insufficient capacity or the failure of our third party providers to provide continuous and uninterrupted service. While we maintain disaster recovery capabilities to return to normal operation in a timely manner, we do not have a fully redundant system that includes an instantaneous recovery capability.\nAs a result of such possible defects, failures, interruptions or other problems, our services and products could be rendered unreliable or be perceived as unreliable by customers, which could result in harm to our reputation and brand. Any failure of our technology or systems could result in an adverse impact on our business.\nOur business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.\nUnauthorized users who penetrate our information security systems could misappropriate proprietary or customer information or data or cause interruptions to the product offerings on our website. As a result, it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by unauthorized users. These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a timely remedy against unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security systems. In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and, in turn, harm our business.\nA significant number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information. Additional states and governmental entities are considering such \"notice\u201d laws. In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported. If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and utilize proprietary and customer information and data. Privacy concerns among prospective and existing customers regarding our use of such information or data collected on our website or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses, could keep them from using our website or purchasing our services or products. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information and data. Businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for their use and handling of such information and data. We rely on third-party software products to secure our credit card transactions. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches or changes in industry standards or regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment and result in chargebacks of fraudulently charged amounts. Furthermore, widespread credit card fraud may lessen our customers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products on our website.\nThird parties may infringe on our brand, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brand. Because our business relies heavily on a direct-to-consumer business model, our brand is an important element of our business strategy. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer. Additionally, failure to protect our intellectual property could result in the entry of a competitor to the market. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving. We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims.\nThird parties may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content. If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings. Any of these results could reduce our revenue and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement new strategic initiatives, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe are continuously evaluating changing consumer preferences and the competitive environment of our industry and seeking out opportunities to improve our performance through the implementation of selected strategic initiatives. The goal of these efforts is to develop and implement a comprehensive and competitive business strategy which addresses the continuing changes in the weight management industry environment and our position within the industry. For example, as the healthcare industry continues to evolve its response to the obesity epidemic so do the requirements, both regulatory and business, for providers. If we do not successfully meet these requirements, we may not be perceived as an appropriate partner for certain purposes. We may not be able to successfully implement our strategic initiatives and realize the intended business opportunities, growth prospects, including new business units, and competitive advantages. Our efforts to capitalize on business opportunities may not bring the intended results. Assumptions underlying expected financial results or consumer demand may not be met or economic conditions may deteriorate. We also may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel to implement our strategic initiatives. If these or other factors limit our ability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives, our business activities, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe sale of our products in markets outside of the United States may subject us to risks.\nThe Company may expand our international sales, marketing and distribution activities or our own or through arrangements with partners located in other countries. The sale, marketing and distribution of our products and programs in such locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 Economic and political instability;\n\u00b7 Import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 Trade restrictions;\n\u00b7 Product registration requirements;\n\u00b7 Longer payment cycles;\n\u00b7 Changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u00b7 Potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7 Potentially weak protection of intellectual property rights.\nWe are dependent on our key executive officers for future success. If we lose the services of any of our key executive officers and we are unable to timely retain a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business. We have not obtained life insurance on any key executive officers. If any key executive officers left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work, our business could be harmed.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition or a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us, even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nOur certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding common stock. The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nChanges in consumer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur program features pre-packaged food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers. Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our program versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences away from our pre-packaged food and support and counseling services, and any failure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects. Our success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items. If we do not continually expand our food items or provide customers with items that are desirable in taste and quality, our business could be harmed.\nThe weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our business.\nThe weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us. Congressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses. Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue. Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss program and result in a decline in revenue. Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user\u2019s failure to use such products or services appropriately.\nOur industry is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.\nOur industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation. Certain federal and state agencies, such as the FTC, regulate and enforce laws relating to advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters. A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity, and restrictions of our business operations. Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies. Many companies in the weight loss industry, including our predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices. In October 2009, the FTC published its revised Guides concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising which now requires us to use a statement as to what the typical weight loss customers can expect to achieve on our program when using a customer's weight loss testimonial in advertising. Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOther aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation. For example, the labeling and distribution of food products, including dietary supplements, are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries' requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters. If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results. Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pays other damages, which could be substantial.\nLaws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are more prevalent and remain unsettled. If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.\nFuture laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.\nThe manufacture and sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.\nLike other manufacturers and distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury. The foods and products that we manufacture and sell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate. Distributors of weight loss food products, including dietary supplements, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time. The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business. We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled; include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances. Additionally, the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. To date, we have not been a party to any product liability litigation and we are not aware of any instance in which any of our products have been defective in any way that could give rise to product liability claims. Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue. Furthermore, the products we manufacture and distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies. Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenue and profits.", "PERMNO": 80054, "SIC": 2090, "TIC": "MED"}
