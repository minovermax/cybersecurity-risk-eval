{"cik": "1389050", "company": "Archrock, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs described in Part I (\u201cDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d), this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements regarding us, our business and our industry. The risk factors described below, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nThe restatement of our financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including regulatory, stockholder or other actions, loss of investor and counterparty confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nWe have restated our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (including the unaudited quarterly periods within 2015 and 2014) to correct for the accounting errors discussed in Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A detailed description of the background of the matter is set forth in our amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015, which we filed with the SEC on February 9, 2017. As a result of the restatement and the circumstances giving rise to the restatement, we have been incurring a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs in connection with or related to the restatement, such as accounting and legal fees as well as sharing a portion of costs incurred by Exterran Corporation with respect to such matters. We could be subject to regulatory, stockholder or other actions in connection with the restatement. Exterran Corporation has disclosed that is has been cooperating with the SEC in an investigation, including responding to a subpoena for documents related to both its restatement and compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which are also being provided to the U.S. Department of Justice at its request. We have been assisting Exterran Corporation in responding to this investigation, including providing information regarding periods prior to the Spin-off that is not otherwise in Exterran Corporation\u2019s possession. Potential proceedings arising out of the SEC\u2019s investigation could result in severe civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions. Any such proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, consume management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. In addition, the restatement and related matters could impair our reputation and could cause our counterparties to lose confidence in us. Each of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nWe are engaged in ongoing litigation regarding our qualification as a Heavy Equipment Dealer, the qualification of our natural gas compressors as Heavy Equipment and the resulting appraisal of our natural gas compressors for ad valorem tax purposes, as well as the location where our natural gas compressors are taxable, under revised Texas statutes. If this litigation is resolved against us, or if in the future we do not qualify as a Heavy Equipment Dealer or our compressors do not qualify as Heavy Equipment because of new or revised Texas statutes, we will incur additional taxes and could be subject to substantial penalties and interest, which would adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn 2011, the Texas Legislature enacted changes related to the appraisal of natural gas compressors for ad valorem tax purposes by expanding the definitions of \u201cHeavy Equipment Dealer\u201d and \u201cHeavy Equipment\u201d effective from the beginning of 2012 (the \u201cHeavy Equipment Statutes\u201d). Under the revised statutes, we believe we are a Heavy Equipment Dealer, that our natural gas compressors are Heavy Equipment and that we, therefore, are required to file our ad valorem taxes under this new methodology. We further believe that our natural gas compressors are taxable under the Heavy Equipment Statutes in the counties where we maintain a business location and keep natural gas compressors instead of where the compressors may be located on January 1 of a tax year. A large number of appraisal review boards denied our position, although some accepted it, and we filed petitions for review in the appropriate district courts with respect to the 2012 through 2016 tax years. See Part I, Item 3 (\u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d) and Note 21 (\u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d) to our Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding legal proceedings to which we are a party, including ongoing litigation regarding our qualification as a Heavy Equipment Dealer, the qualification of our natural gas compressors as Heavy Equipment and the resulting appraisal of our natural gas compressors for ad valorem tax purposes, as well as the location where our natural gas compressors are taxable, under revised Texas statutes.\nAs a result of the new methodology, our ad valorem tax expense (which is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)) includes a benefit of $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Since the change in methodology became effective in 2012, we have recorded an aggregate benefit of $60.7 million as of December 31, 2016, of which approximately $13.7 million has been agreed to by a number of appraisal review boards and county appraisal districts and $47.0 million has been disputed and is currently in litigation. Recognizing the similarity of the issues and that these cases will ultimately be resolved by the Texas appellate courts, we have reached, or intend to reach, agreements with some of the appraisal districts to stay or abate certain of these pending district court cases. If we are unsuccessful in our litigation with the appraisal districts, we would be required to pay ad valorem taxes up to the aggregate benefit we have recorded, and the additional ad valorem tax payments may also be subject to substantial penalties and interest. In addition, while we do not expect the ultimate determination of the issue of where the natural gas compressors are taxable under the Heavy Equipment Statutes would have an impact on the amount of taxes due, we could be subject to substantial penalties if we are unsuccessful on this issue. Also, if we are unsuccessful in our litigation with the appraisal districts, or if legislation is enacted in Texas that repeals or alters the Heavy Equipment Statutes such that in the future we do not qualify as a Heavy Equipment Dealer or our compressors do not qualify as Heavy Equipment, then we would likely be required to pay these ad valorem taxes under the old methodology going forward, which would increase our quarterly cost of sales expense up to approximately the amount of our then most recent quarterly benefit recorded. If this litigation is resolved against us in whole or in part, or if in the future we do not qualify as a Heavy Equipment Dealer or our compressors do not qualify as Heavy Equipment because of new or revised Texas statutes, we will incur additional taxes and could be subject to substantial penalties and interest, which would impact our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and also our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nWhile we paid quarterly dividends of $0.095 per share of common stock with respect to each of the first two quarters of 2016, and a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share of common stock with respect to the last two quarters of 2016, there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future.\nWe paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.095 per share of common stock with respect to each of the first two quarters of 2016, and a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share of common stock with respect to the second two quarters of 2016. We cannot provide assurance that we will, at any time in the future, again generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend or that our Board of Directors would determine to use any such surplus or our net profits to pay a dividend.\nFuture dividends may be affected by, among other factors:\n\u2022\nthe availability of surplus or net profits, which in turn depend on the performance of our business and operating subsidiaries, including the Partnership;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership attributable to our ownership interest in the Partnership;\n\u2022\nour debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance our debt in the future or borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nour future capital requirements, including to fund our operating expenses and other working capital needs;\n\u2022\nthe rates we charge for our services;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our services;\n\u2022\nthe creditworthiness of our customers;\n\u2022\nour level of operating expenses;\n\u2022\nExterran Corporation\u2019s ability to recover in full, and our ability to receive contributions from Exterran Corporation corresponding to, the remaining proceeds to be paid to Exterran Corporation from PDVSA Gas, S.A., or PDVSA Gas;\n\u2022\nExterran Corporation\u2019s ability to consummate a qualified capital raise, as that term is used in the separation and distribution agreement, and our ability to receive a $25 million cash payment from Exterran Corporation as a result of such a capital raise; and\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will declare or pay dividends in any particular amounts or at all in the future. A decision not to pay dividends or a reduction in our dividend payments in the future could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nWe depend on distributions from the Partnership to meet our capital needs and pay dividends to our stockholders.\nTo generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, fund our business and pay dividends, we depend heavily on the cash distributions from the Partnership to us attributable to our ownership interest in the Partnership. Our ownership interest in the Partnership, including our limited partner interest, general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in the Partnership, is a significant cash-generating asset for us. As a result, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of the Partnership to make distributions to its partners. Applicable law and contractual restrictions (including restrictions in the Partnership\u2019s debt instruments and partnership agreement) may negatively impact our ability to obtain such distributions from our subsidiaries, including the rights of the creditors of the Partnership that would often be superior to our interests in the Partnership. Given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in the Partnership\u2019s contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016. A decline in the Partnership\u2019s business or revenues or increases in its expenses, principal and interest payments under existing and future debt instruments, working capital requirements or other cash needs could impair the Partnership\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to unit holders, including us, at the Partnership\u2019s current distribution rate. A reduction in the amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership would reduce the amount of cash available to us for payment of dividends, which could limit our ability to pay cash dividends at our current rate or at all, and would also reduce the amount of cash available to us for the payment of our debt and for the funding of our business requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExterran Corporation is due to receive installment payments from the purchaser of its previously nationalized Venezuelan assets, the nonpayment of which would render Exterran Corporation unable to contribute amounts corresponding to those funds to us, which would negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn March 2012 and August 2012, Exterran Corporation sold its previously nationalized Venezuelan joint venture assets and Venezuelan subsidiary assets, respectively, to PDVSA Gas, a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (\u201cPDVSA\u201d), for aggregate consideration of approximately $550 million. Exterran Corporation or its subsidiary was due to receive the remaining principal amount as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $37.5 million. As these remaining proceeds are received, Exterran Corporation intends to contribute to us an amount equal to such proceeds pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement. In January 2017, Exterran Corporation received an additional installment payment, including an annual charge, of $19.7 million from PDVSA Gas relating to its subsidiaries\u2019 previously nationalized assets and transferred cash to us equal to that amount.\nPDVSA\u2019s payments to many of its suppliers and partners are currently significantly in arrears, and PDVSA\u2019s payments to Exterran Corporation have been in arrears from time to time in the past. The ongoing social, political, economic and legal climate has given rise to significant uncertainties about the country\u2019s economic and political stability. Since the presidential election in the first half of 2013, the Venezuelan government has increasingly used foreign-exchange, price and capital controls to attempt to address the country\u2019s economic challenges. If current political unrest were to develop into a prolonged period of governmental or economic instability, or if PDVSA becomes increasingly unable to pay its suppliers and partners due to the detrimental effect of recent commodity price declines on Venezuela\u2019s economy or for other reasons, Exterran Corporation\u2019s ability to recover in full, and our ability to receive additional contributions corresponding to, the remaining proceeds to be paid from PDVSA Gas to Exterran Corporation could be adversely impacted. As of February 2017, PDVSA was in arrears on its payment obligations due to Exterran Corporation. Exterran Corporation has agreed to waive a payment obligation that was due on August 10, 2016 until March 31, 2017, although it is uncertain whether PDVSA will make the past due payment by that date. If Exterran Corporation or its subsidiary does not receive that payment or any other remaining proceeds and we do not receive additional contributions from Exterran Corporation corresponding to the amount of such proceeds, our liquidity and financial condition would be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, in the event that PDVSA Gas defaults on any installment payment and Exterran Corporation is unwilling or unable to recover such installment payment, we may incur significant costs and expenses and expend significant resources, including the time and attention of our management team, in pursuing the recovery of such installment payment, which may negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nWe have the right to receive a cash payment from Exterran Corporation upon the refinancing of its term loan under certain conditions, which if not met would negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn October 2015, a subsidiary of Exterran Corporation entered into a new $245.0 million term loan, which will mature on November 3, 2017. Exterran Corporation or its subsidiary will be required to refinance its term loan at or prior to its maturity date by entering into one or more new facilities or otherwise raising the funds necessary to repay the outstanding principal amount under the term loan. In connection with the Spin-off, Exterran Corporation\u2019s operating subsidiary contributed to one of our subsidiaries the right to receive, promptly following the occurrence of a qualified capital raise, as that term is used in the separation and distribution agreement, the right to receive a $25.0 million cash payment. No assurance can be given that Exterran Corporation or its subsidiary will be able to enter into new facilities or issue equity in the future on attractive terms or at all. If Exterran Corporation or its subsidiary is unable to consummate a qualified capital raise, we will not receive the $25.0 million cash payment, which would negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt that could limit our ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure to risk during adverse economic conditions.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.4 billion in outstanding debt obligations net of unamortized debt discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs. Many factors, including factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness. These factors include those discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors and those listed in the Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur substantial debt and associated commitments could have important adverse consequences. For example, these commitments could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on a portion of our debt are based upon variable interest rates and a portion can adjust based upon our credit statistics;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or less restrictive covenants in such debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance our debt in the future or borrow additional funds.\nCovenants in our debt agreements may impair our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit facility contains various covenants with which we or certain of our subsidiaries must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, liens on assets, repurchasing equity and making distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. We are also subject to financial covenants, including a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) (as defined in the credit agreement) to Total Interest Expense (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than 2.25 to 1.0 and a ratio of consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the credit agreement) to EBITDA of not greater than 4.25 to 1.0 (subject to a temporary increase to 4.75 to 1.0 for any quarter during which an acquisition meeting certain thresholds is completed and for the following two quarters after the acquisition closes). As of December 31, 2016, we maintained a 27.2 to 1.0 EBITDA to Total Interest Expense ratio and a 1.4 to 1.0 consolidated Total Debt to EBITDA ratio. If we were to anticipate non-compliance with these financial ratios, we may take actions to maintain compliance with them, possibly including reductions in our general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures or the payment of cash dividends at our current dividend rate. Any of these measures could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flows or the price of our common stock. If we fail to remain in compliance with our financial covenants we would be in default under our debt agreements. A default under one or more of our debt agreements would trigger cross-default provisions under certain of our other debt agreements, which would accelerate our obligation to repay our indebtedness under those agreements. In addition, if we experience a material adverse effect on our assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations, that, taken as a whole, impacts our ability to, perform our obligations under our debt agreements, this could lead to a default under our debt agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our debt agreements.\nThe Partnership\u2019s senior secured credit agreement (\u201cPartnership Credit Agreement\u201d) contains various covenants with which the Partnership must comply, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of proceeds from borrowings and limitations on the Partnership\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate, sell assets, make certain investments and acquisitions, make loans, grant liens, repurchase equity and pay dividends and distributions. The Partnership Credit Agreement also contains various covenants, which have been amended effective March 31, 2016, requiring mandatory prepayments from the net cash proceeds of certain asset transfers. In addition, if as of any date the Partnership has cash and cash equivalents (other than proceeds from a debt or equity issuance in the 30 days prior to such date reasonably expected to be used to fund an acquisition permitted under the Partnership Credit Agreement) in excess of $50.0 million, then such excess amount will be used to pay down outstanding borrowings of a corresponding amount under the revolving credit facility.\nThe Partnership must maintain various consolidated financial ratios, including a ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) to Total Interest Expense (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.75 to 1.0, a ratio of Total Debt (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) to EBITDA of not greater than 5.95 to 1.0 though the fourth quarter of 2017, 5.75 to 1.0 in the first quarter of 2018, and 5.25 to 1.0 (subject to a temporary increase to 5.5 to 1.0 for any quarter during which an acquisition meeting certain thresholds is completed and for the following two quarters after the acquisition closes) thereafter and a ratio of Senior Secured Debt (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) to EBITDA of not greater than 3.50 to 1.0 through the fourth quarter of 2017, 3.75 to 1.0 in the first quarter of 2018 and 4.0 to 1.0 thereafter. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership maintained a 3.9 to 1.0 EBITDA to Total Interest Expense ratio, a 4.7 to 1.0 Total Debt to EBITDA ratio and a 2.3 to 1.0 Senior Secured Debt to EBITDA ratio. If the Partnership were to anticipate non-compliance with these financial ratios, the Partnership may take actions to maintain compliance with them, including a reduction in general and administrative expenses, its capital expenditures or the payment of cash distributions at its current distribution rate to its unit holders, including us. A reduction in the amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership would reduce the amount of cash available for payment of our debt, payment of dividends and the funding of our business requirements, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A default under one of the Partnership\u2019s debt agreements would trigger cross-default provisions under the Partnership\u2019s other debt agreements, which would accelerate the Partnership\u2019s obligation to repay its indebtedness under those agreements. In addition, a material adverse effect with respect to the Partnership\u2019s assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations that, taken as a whole, impacts the Partnership\u2019s ability to perform its obligations under the Partnership Credit Agreement, could lead to a default under that agreement. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Partnership Credit Agreement.\nThe breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt agreements, which could cause our indebtedness under those agreements to become due and payable. If the repayment obligations on any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not be able to repay the debt or refinance the debt on acceptable terms, and our financial position would be materially adversely affected.\nAs a result of recent market instability, we may be unable to access the capital and credit markets or borrow on affordable terms to obtain additional capital that we may require.\nHistorically, we have financed acquisitions, operating expenditures and capital expenditures with a combination of cash provided by operating and financing activities. However, to the extent we are unable to finance our operating expenditures, capital expenditures, scheduled interest and debt repayments and any future dividends with net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility, we may require additional capital. Recent instability in the capital markets (both generally and in the oil and gas industry in particular) could limit our ability to access the capital markets to raise debt or equity capital on affordable terms or to obtain additional financing. Recent instability in the oil and gas industry, among other things, may cause some lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity at favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or if we are not successful in raising capital within the time period required or at all, we may not be able to grow or maintain our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the delayed filing of our Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 with the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nAs a result of the delayed filing of our Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 with the SEC, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until we have timely filed all periodic reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for at least twelve calendar months. As a result, should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public, our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction timely and successfully and potentially harming our financial condition.\nWe have identified material weaknesses related to our internal controls in the past, and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nAs described in Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d on January 4, 2017, we concluded that the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 should no longer be relied upon. In connection with the restatement of our prior financial statements, we identified certain matters involving our internal control over financial reporting that existed prior to the completion of the Spin-off that we determined to be material weaknesses. Although management has determined that the risks and internal controls related to our former international operations were no longer relevant as of December 31, 2015, we cannot assure you that other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be discovered or occur in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weakness, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), similar worldwide anti-bribery laws and trade control laws.\nThe FCPA and similar laws and regulations of other countries prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. Prior to the Spin-off of our international operations in November 2015, we operated in many parts of the world that experience high levels of corruption, and our business would bring us in frequent contact with foreign officials. Our compliance policies and programs mandate compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance. Our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents. Actual or alleged violations of these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses, and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Exterran Corporation has disclosed that is has been cooperating with the SEC in an investigation, including responding to a subpoena for documents related to both its restatement and compliance with the FCPA, which are also being provided to the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) at its request. We have been assisting Exterran Corporation in responding to this investigation, including providing information regarding periods prior to the Spin-off that is not otherwise in Exterran Corporation\u2019s possession. A violation of the FCPA or other anti-bribery law violations due to our own acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others could result in severe civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations financial condition and stock price.\nOur ability to manage and grow our business effectively may be adversely affected if we lose management or operational personnel.\nWe believe that our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be challenging and important. In addition, following the closing of the Spin-off, certain of our key personnel became employees of Exterran Corporation. The supply of experienced operational and field personnel, in particular, decreases as other energy and manufacturing companies\u2019 needs for the same personnel increase. Our ability to grow and to continue our current level of service to our customers will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully hire, train and retain these important personnel.\nThe erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers finance their exploration and production activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. During times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience a downturn in their financial condition. Additionally, some of our midstream customers may provide their gathering, transportation and related services to a limited number of companies in the oil and gas production business. A reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, the lack of availability of debt or equity financing or other factors that negatively impact our customers\u2019 financial condition could result in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending for our products and services, which may result in their cancellation of contracts, the cancellation or delay of scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression equipment, their determination not to enter into new natural gas compression service contracts, or their determination to cancel or delay orders for our services. Furthermore, the loss by our midstream customers of their key customers could reduce demand for their services and result in a deterioration of their financial condition, which would in turn decrease their demand for our services. Any such action by our customers would reduce demand for our services. Reduced demand for our services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, in the event of the financial failure of a customer, we could experience a loss on all or a portion of our outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer.\nThe loss of our business with Williams Partners or the inability or failure of Williams Partners to meet its payment obligations may adversely affect the our and the Partnership\u2019s financial results, which could limit the amount of cash the Partnership has available for distribution to its equity holders, including us.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Williams Partners (formerly known as Access) accounted for approximately 13% and 12% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, Access accounted for approximately 3% of our consolidated revenue. Access merged with Williams Partners, a publicly traded limited partnership controlled by The Williams Companies, Inc., in February 2015 and, on an as-combined basis, Access and Williams Partners would have accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nThere is no guarantee that, upon the expiration of the Partnership\u2019s existing services agreements with Williams Partners, Williams Partners will choose to renew these existing services agreements or enter into similar agreements with the Partnership. The loss of business with Williams Partners, unless offset by additional contract compression services revenue from other customers, or the inability or failure of Williams Partners to meet its payment obligations under contractual arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to its equity holders, including us, and on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay cash dividends.\nThe completed Spin-off of our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.\nHistorically, companies seeking to perform a tax-free spin-off transaction have been able to seek broad private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) that the proposed spin-off transaction would qualify for tax-free treatment, with the exception of certain issues on which the IRS would not rule. However, in 2013 the IRS announced that it would no longer provide such broad advance rulings but would instead rule only on certain \u201csignificant issues.\u201d We did not request a ruling from the IRS regarding the Spin-off of our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses. Prior to completing the Spin-off, we did receive an opinion of counsel that the Spin-off should qualify as reorganization under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and, as a result, neither we nor our stockholders should recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Spin-off. However, this opinion is not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the Spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel. If the Spin-off and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable to us, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if the Spin-off were taxable to our stockholders, each holder of our common stock who received shares of Exterran Corporation would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.\nWe may face challenges as a result of being a smaller, less diversified business than we were prior to the Spin-off.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and fabrication operations and certain of our logistical capabilities and operational efficiencies were contributed to Exterran Corporation, and certain of our key personnel became employees of Exterran Corporation. Because our business after the Spin-off represents a subset of our business immediately prior to the Spin-off, we have access to a smaller pool of assets, fewer personnel, less geographic diversity and less operational diversity, among other challenges, than we did prior to the Spin-off. As a result, we are a smaller and less diversified company with more limited financial resources and operational capabilities, and we may be unable to attract or retain customers that prefer to contract with more diversified companies that are able to operate on a larger scale than us. In addition, as a smaller and less diversified business, we may be more adversely impacted by changes in our business than we would have been prior to the Spin-off. For example, the impact of certain events on our business prior to the Spin-off may not have been material to our operations at such time, but similar events may have a material impact on our business following the Spin-off. We may also be less capable of providing the Partnership with certain financial and operational support, including certain historical cost caps that we provided to the Partnership prior to 2015, that we were capable of providing to the Partnership prior to the Spin-off. In addition, because we are a smaller and less diversified business following the Spin-off, certain legal proceedings may have greater impact on our business following the Spin-off than they did before the Spin-off. Each of these events could negatively impact our business and cause our financial condition and results of operations to suffer.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax liabilities following the Spin-off.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Exterran Corporation that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Exterran Holdings consolidated tax reporting group between us and Exterran Corporation. If Exterran Corporation is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we would be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nWe might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for tax-free distributions.\nOur ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Even if the Spin-off otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may result in corporate-level taxable gain to us under Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership, by vote or value, of shares of our stock, Exterran Corporation\u2019s stock or the stock of a successor of either occurring as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Spin-off. Any acquisitions or issuances of our stock or Exterran Corporation\u2019s stock within two years after the Spin-off are generally presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Exterran Corporation may be able to rebut that presumption.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Exterran Corporation, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the Spin-off from being tax-free.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Moreover, the tax matters agreement also may provide that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on us or any of our affiliates as a result of the failure of the Spin-off to qualify for favorable treatment under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the Spin-off by or in respect of us, any of our affiliates or our shareholders.\nThe Spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nThe Spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Under these laws, if a court in a lawsuit by an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (including without limitation a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or any of our respective subsidiaries) were to determine that we or any of our subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for distributing our common stock or taking other action as part of the Spin-off, or that we or any of our subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness, including the borrowings incurred by us under the new credit facility in connection with the Spin-off, transferring assets or taking other action as part of the Spin-off and, at the time of such action, we, Exterran Corporation or any of our respective subsidiaries (i) was insolvent or would be rendered insolvent, (ii) lacked reasonably sufficient capital to carry on its business and all business in which it intended to engage or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they would mature, then such court could void the Spin-off as a constructive fraudulent transfer. If such court made this determination, the court could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, voiding our liens and claims against Exterran Corporation, or providing Exterran Corporation with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Exterran Corporation and the fair market value of our company at the time of the Spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than (i) the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities) or (ii) the amount that will be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and mature. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, Exterran Corporation or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-off, including the distribution of the Exterran Corporation common stock.\nUnder the separation and distribution agreement we entered into in connection with the Spin-off, from and after the Spin-off, each of Exterran Corporation and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which it owns and operates following the consummation of the Spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Exterran Corporation, particularly if Exterran Corporation were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations.\nMany of our contract operations services contracts have short initial terms and after the initial term are cancelable on short notice, and we cannot be sure that such contracts will be extended or renewed after the end of the initial contractual term. Any such nonrenewals, or renewals at reduced rates, or the loss of contracts with any significant customer, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe length of our contract operations services contracts with customers varies based on operating conditions and customer needs. Our initial contract terms typically are not long enough to enable us to recoup the cost of the equipment we utilize to provide contract operations services and these contracts are typically cancelable on short notice after the initial term. We cannot be sure that a substantial number of these contracts will be extended or renewed by our customers or that any of our customers will continue to contract with us. The inability to negotiate extensions or renew a substantial portion of our contract operations services contracts, the renewal of such contracts at reduced rates, the inability to contract for additional services with our customers or the loss of all or a significant portion of our services contracts with any significant customer could lead to a reduction in revenues and net income and could require us to record additional asset impairments. This could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of our supply agreement with Exterran Corporation, we are subject to counterparty risk associated with Exterran Corporation\u2019s business, including product shortages and price increases involving Exterran Corporation\u2019s suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to purchase compression equipment from Exterran Corporation or other third parties, we may be unable to retain existing customers or compete for new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnder the terms of our supply agreement with Exterran Corporation, we are required to purchase our requirements of newly-fabricated compression equipment during the term of the agreement from Exterran Corporation and its affiliates, subject to certain exceptions. As a result, we are subject to many of the same counterparty risks as Exterran Corporation with respect to its suppliers. For example, certain of the components used in the compression equipment we expect to purchase from Exterran Corporation are obtained by Exterran Corporation from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Exterran Corporation\u2019s reliance on these suppliers involves several risks, including price increases, inferior component quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner. Exterran Corporation does not have long-term contracts with some of these sources, and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain compression equipment from Exterran Corporation which, in turn, could have a negative impact on our results of operations, reputation and customer relationships. Further, any increase in component prices for compression equipment fabricated by Exterran Corporation for us will be passed on to us under the terms of our supply agreement. As a result, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, except as set forth in our supply agreement, Exterran Corporation is not under any obligation to offer or sell to us newly-fabricated compression equipment, and may choose not to sell such equipment to us on time or at all. In the event that we are not able to purchase compression equipment from Exterran Corporation, we may not be able to purchase such compression equipment from third-party producers or marketers of such equipment or from our competitors on comparable terms or at all. If we are unable to purchase compression equipment on a timely basis to meet the demands of our customers, our existing customers may terminate their contractual relationships with us, or we may not be able to compete for business from new or existing customers, which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or our investment in the Partnership units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of our investment in the Partnership depends largely on it being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including the Partnership, or our investment in the Partnership may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time.\nFrom time to time, members of Congress propose and consider such substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. Although there is no current legislative proposal, a prior legislative proposal would have eliminated the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations upon which the Partnership relies for its treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that the Partnership is organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, it would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless at least 90% of its gross income is \u2018\u2018qualifying income\u2019\u2019 under Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u2018\u2018Qualifying Income Exception\u2019\u2019).\nThe Partnership has requested and obtained favorable private letter rulings from the IRS with respect to the characterization of certain of its income as qualifying income. In addition, on January 24, 2017, final regulations regarding which activities give rise to qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code (the \u201cFinal Regulations\u201d) were published in the Federal Register. The Final Regulations are effective as of January 19, 2017, and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 19, 2017. We do not believe the Final Regulations affect the Partnership\u2019s ability to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws could make it more difficult or impossible for the Partnership to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and could be applied retroactively. Any such changes could cause the Partnership to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject it to taxation as an entity if its gross income is not properly classified as qualifying income.\nIf the Partnership were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, its cash available for distribution, including to us as holders of Partnership units, would be substantially reduced. Further, distributions to unitholders, including us, would generally be taxed as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to unitholders.\nTherefore, treatment of the Partnership as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to the unitholders, which would cause a substantial reduction in the value of our investment in the Partnership and in the amount of distributions that we receive from the Partnership, which would reduce the amount of cash available for payment of our debt, payment of dividends and the funding of our business requirements, and as a result would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay cash dividends.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, litigation and other proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to various claims, both in litigation and binding arbitration proceedings. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to various claims, which, if not resolved within amounts we have accrued, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Similarly, any claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. See Part I, Item 3 (\u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d) and also Note 21 (\u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d) to our Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding certain legal proceedings to which we are a party.\nWe face significant competitive pressures that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance.\nOur business is highly competitive and there are low barriers to entry, especially our natural gas compression services. Our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to technological changes within our industry and changes in economic and market conditions, more readily take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our ability to renew or replace existing contract operations service contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products, equipment or services or substantially decrease the price at which they offer their products, equipment or services, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nIn addition, we could face significant competition from new entrants into the compression services business. Some of our existing competitors or new entrants may expand or fabricate new compression units that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, our customers may purchase and operate their own compressor fleets in lieu of using our natural gas compression services. We also may not be able to take advantage of certain opportunities or make certain investments because of our debt levels and our other obligations. Any of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases due to our floating rate debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, after taking into consideration interest rate swaps, we had $258.5 million of outstanding indebtedness that was effectively subject to floating interest rates. Changes in economic conditions outside of our control could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing the funds available for capital investment, operations or other purposes. A 1% increase in the effective interest rate on our outstanding debt subject to floating interest rates at December 31, 2016 would result in an annual increase in our interest expense of approximately $2.6 million. In addition, a substantial portion of the Partnership\u2019s cash flow must be used to service its debt obligations. Any increase in the Partnership\u2019s interest expense could reduce the amount of cash the Partnership has available for distribution to its equity holders, including us, and as a result negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows and also our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nOur operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures and natural disasters, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. These risks may expose us, as an equipment operator, to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. The insurance we carry against many of these risks may not be adequate to cover our claims or losses. In addition, we are substantially self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation, employer\u2019s liability, property, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThreats of cyber attacks or terrorism could affect our business.\nWe may be threatened by problems such as cyber attacks, computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. Our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our assets may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to service our customers. We may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict. The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources, and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in locations throughout the United States and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, and local governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our tax provision or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nU.S. federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect demand for our contract operations services.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We do not perform hydraulic fracturing, but many of our customers do. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state agencies, but recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate U.S. federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.\nFor example, at the U.S. federal level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act and proposed regulations under the CWA governing wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. On March 26, 2015, the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management released a final rule that updates existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on U.S. federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. The final rule was expected to be effective on June 24, 2015, but, on September 30, 2015, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction preventing implementation of the rule and, on June 21, 2016, that court voided the rule for exceeding the agency\u2019s statutory authority. In addition, several governmental reviews are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. The results of this study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 or otherwise.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new or more stringent U.S. federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. Any such restrictions could reduce demand for our contract operations services, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew regulations, proposed regulations and proposed modifications to existing regulations under the CAA, if implemented, could result in increased compliance costs.\nOn June 3, 2016, the EPA issued final regulations amending the New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) for the oil and natural gas source category and applying to sources of emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOC\u201d) from certain processes, activities and equipment that is constructed, modified or reconstructed after September 18, 2015. Specifically, the regulation contains both methane and VOC standards for several emission sources not currently covered by the NSPS, such as fugitive emissions from compressor stations and pneumatic pumps and methane standards for certain emission sources that are already regulated for VOC, such as equipment leaks at natural gas processing plants. The amendments also establish methane standards for a subset of equipment that the current NSPS regulates, including reciprocating compressors and pneumatic controllers, and extend the current VOC standards to the remaining unregulated equipment. At this point, we cannot predict whether any such proposed regulations would require us to incur material costs.\nOn November 18, 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management published final regulations to reduce venting and flaring on federal and tribal lands. The regulation requires leak detection inspections at compressor stations and imposes requirements to reduce emissions from pneumatic controllers, among other things. This rule may require us to incur material costs to comply.\nOn October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a new National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\u201cNAAQS\u201d) ozone standard of 70 parts per billion (ppb), which is a reduction from the 75 ppb standard set in 2008. This new standard became effective on December 28, 2015. The states are expected to establish revised attainment/non-attainment regions based on the revised ozone standard by approximately October 2017, utilizing air quality data collected between 2014 and 2016. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.\nIn addition, in January 2011, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (\u201cTCEQ\u201d) finalized revisions to certain air permit programs that significantly increase air emissions-related requirements for new and certain existing oil and gas production and gathering sites in the Barnett Shale production area. The final rule established new emissions standards for engines, which could impact the operation of specific categories of engines by requiring the use of alternative engines, compressor packages or the installation of aftermarket emissions control equipment. The rule became effective for the Barnett Shale production area in April 2011, and the lower emissions standards will become applicable between 2020 and 2030 depending on the type of engine and the permitting requirements. A number of other states where our engines are operated have adopted or are considering adopting additional regulations that could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements for engines, some of which could entail material costs to comply. At this point, however, we cannot predict whether any such rules would require us to incur material costs.\nFinally, on June 3, 2016, the EPA issued final rules under the CAA regarding criteria for aggregating multiple sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, such as compressor stations, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require the installation of costly pollution control equipment.\nThese new regulations and proposals, when finalized, and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment or the adoption of other environmental protection measures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of governmental regulations; failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, including relating to the environment, health and safety, export controls, labor and employment and taxation. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance. From time to time, as part of our operations, including newly acquired operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities in the various states in which we operate.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which may render us liable for remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and costs associated with new information, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could negatively impact our financial condition, profitability and results of operations. Moreover, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations.\nWe may need to apply for or amend facility permits or licenses from time to time with respect to storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling, or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations, which subjects us to new or revised permitting conditions that may be onerous or costly to comply with. In addition, certain of our customer service arrangements may require us to operate, on behalf of a specific customer, petroleum storage units such as underground tanks or pipelines and other regulated units, all of which may impose additional compliance and permitting obligations.\nWe conduct operations at numerous facilities in a wide variety of locations across the continental U.S. The operations at many of these facilities require environmental permits or other authorizations. Additionally, natural gas compressors at many of our customers\u2019 facilities require individual air permits or general authorizations to operate under various air regulatory programs established by rule or regulation. These permits and authorizations frequently contain numerous compliance requirements, including monitoring and reporting obligations and operational restrictions, such as emission limits. Given the large number of facilities in which we operate, and the numerous environmental permits and other authorizations that are applicable to our operations, we may occasionally identify or be notified of technical violations of certain requirements existing in various permits or other authorizations. Occasionally, we have been assessed penalties for our non-compliance, and we could be subject to such penalties in the future.\nWe routinely deal with natural gas, oil and other petroleum products. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties used by us to provide contract operations services or inactive compression storage or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory, remediation and monitoring requirements under environmental laws and regulations.\nThe modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations, or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production, gathering and pipeline companies, including our customers, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nClimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased compliance costs.\nThe U.S. Congress has previously considered legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. One bill, passed by the House of Representatives in 2009, but never adopted by the full Congress, would have required greenhouse gas emissions reductions by covered sources of as much as 17% from 2005 levels by 2020 and by as much as 83% by 2050. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other initiatives continue to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. In addition, almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that smaller sources such as our gas-fired compressors could become subject to greenhouse gas-related regulation. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations.\nIndependent of Congress, the EPA has promulgated regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions under its existing CAA authority. The EPA has adopted rules requiring many facilities, including petroleum and natural gas systems, to inventory and report their greenhouse gas emissions. These reporting obligations were triggered for some sites we operated in 2016.\nIn addition, the EPA in June 2010 published a final rule providing for the tailored applicability of air permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA reported that the rulemaking was necessary because without it certain permitting requirements would apply as of January 2011 at an emissions level that would have greatly increased the number of required permits and, among other things, imposed undue costs on small sources and overwhelmed the resources of permitting authorities. In the rule, the EPA established two initial steps of phase-in to minimize those burdens, excluding certain smaller sources from greenhouse gas permitting until at least April 30, 2016. On January 2, 2011, the first step of the phase-in applied only to new projects at major sources (as defined under those CAA permitting programs) that, among other things, increase net greenhouse gas emissions by 75,000 tons per year. On July 1, 2011, the second step of the phase-in began requiring permitting for otherwise minor sources of air emissions that have the potential to emit at least 100,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases. On June 29, 2012, the EPA issued final regulations for \u201cPhase III\u201d of its program, retaining the permitting thresholds established in Phases I and II. On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that greenhouse gas emissions alone cannot trigger an obligation to obtain such an air permit even if the project will substantially increase the source\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. However, for those sources that trigger such air permitting requirements based on their traditional criteria pollutant emissions, the permit must include a limit for greenhouse gases. In addition, the Court concluded that the rule was flawed because the EPA failed to identify a de minimis threshold for greenhouse gases below which Best Available Control Technology would not be required. As of October 3, 2016, the EPA published a proposed rule that would set that de minimis threshold at 75,000 tons per year, effectively restoring the permitting levels that the agency was applying prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 decision. The requirement for large sources of greenhouse gas emissions to obtain and comply with permits will affect some of our and our customers\u2019 largest new or modified facilities going forward.\nAlthough it is not currently possible to predict how any proposed or future greenhouse gas legislation or regulation by Congress, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe price of our common stock and the Partnership\u2019s common units may be volatile.\nSome of the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are quarterly increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, the amount of distributions we receive from the Partnership, the amount of dividend payments we make, changes in interest rates, changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community and speculation in the press or investment community about our financial condition or results of operations. General market conditions and U.S. or international economic factors and political events unrelated to our performance may also affect our stock price. In addition, the price of our common stock may be impacted by changes in the value of our investment in and/or distributions from the Partnership. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent trends in the price of our common stock to predict the future price of our common stock or our financial results.\nOur charter and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would result in the purchase of our stockholders\u2019 shares of common stock at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nThere are provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would result in the purchase of our stockholders\u2019 shares of common stock at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, such as limitations on stockholder actions by written consent and on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. Delaware corporation law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by the board of directors.", "PERMNO": 92245, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "AROC"}
