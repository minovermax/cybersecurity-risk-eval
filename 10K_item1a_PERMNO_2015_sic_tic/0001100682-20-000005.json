{"cik": "1100682", "company": "CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSet forth below, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. We note that factors set forth below, individually or in the aggregate, as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or that are currently believed to not be material to the business, may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties and the risks described below should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and in future documents we file with the SEC.\nA reduction in demand may adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug R&D expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as by academic institutions, government laboratories or private foundations. Similarly, economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect their R&D budgets and, consequentially, our business as well.\nOur clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the non-clinical phases of R&D (and in particular discovery and safety assessment) and to outsource the products and services we provide. Furthermore, our clients (particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies) continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on lowering R&D costs per drug candidate. Fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the R&D budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. R&D budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities (including available resources of our biotechnology clients, particularly those that are cash-negative, who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment), general economic conditions, institutional budgetary policies and the impact of government regulations, including potential drug pricing legislation. Available funding for biotechnology clients in particular may be affected by the capital markets, investment objectives of venture capital investors and priorities of biopharmaceutical industry sponsors.\nFor additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing R&D budgets at our clients, please see the sections entitled \u201cOur Strategy\u201d and \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nFurther, our Research Products operations are structured to produce particular blood products based on customers\u2019 existing demand, and perceived potential changes in demand, for these products. Sudden or unexpected changes in demand for these products could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Increasing demand could harm relationships with customers if we are unable to alter production capacity, or purchase products from other suppliers, to fill orders adequately. This could result in a decrease in overall revenue and profits. Decreases in demand may require us to make sizable investments to restructure operations away from declining products to the production of new products. Lack of access to sufficient capital, or lack of adequate time to properly respond to such a change in demand, could result in declining revenue and profits, as customers transfer to other suppliers.\nA reduction or delay in government funding of R&D may adversely affect our business.\nA portion of revenue, predominantly in our RMS segment, is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and similar domestic and international agencies, which can be difficult to forecast. We also sell directly to the NIH and these other agencies. Government funding of R&D is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenue may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals, included reduced allocations to government agencies that fund R&D activities. Government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the NIH and other government agencies that fund R&D activities, or NIH funding may not be directed towards projects and studies that require the use of our products and services, both of which could adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nSeveral of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply, which if interrupted could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products, such as large research models. Disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems (including as a result of the spread of diseases, such as coronavirus), export or import laws/restrictions or embargoes, tariffs, international trade regulations, foreign government or economic instability, severe weather conditions, increased competition among suppliers for models, disruptions to the air travel system, activist campaigns, commercial disputes, supplier insolvency or other ordinary course or unanticipated events. Any disruption of supply could materially harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms. While we continue to take steps to find alternative supply channels and lock in supply with preferred sources through multi-year and/or minimum commitment contracts, such mitigating efforts may not prove successful at ensuring a steady and timely supply or may require us to pay significantly higher prices for such products\nduring periods of global shortage or restrictions on the transportation of products. In addition, limited global supply or regional restrictions on transportation for certain products may require us to source products from non-preferred vendors.\nFurther, our Research Products business depends on the availability of appropriate donors. If the level of donor participation declines, we may not be able to reduce costs sufficiently to maintain profitability of the Research Products business. For example, regulations intended to reduce the risk of introducing infectious diseases in the blood supply (including coronavirus) could also result in a decreased pool of potential donors. Due to any pandemic, epidemic or outbreak in one or more regions in which our Research Products business operates, the portion of the public that typically donates may be unable, or unwilling to donate, thereby significantly reducing the availability of research products upon which we rely. In addition, even if suspected diseases prove to be no more virulent than other more common disease, the heightened fear among the public resulting from widespread media coverage may result in a dramatic decline in donations.\nWe have in the past experienced and in the future could experience an unauthorized access into our information systems.\nWe operate large and complex information systems that contain significant amounts of client data. As a routine element of our business, we collect, analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the non-clinical studies we conduct for our clients. Unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such information systems to steal data or disrupt the systems. While we have taken measures to protect them from intrusion, in March 2019, we detected evidence that an unauthorized third party, who we believe was well resourced and highly sophisticated, accessed certain of our information systems and copied data. We worked with a leading cyber security firm to assist in our investigation and coordinated with law enforcement authorities. Our investigation indicated that the affected information included client information.\nIn December 2019, we disclosed that we had completed our remediation of the incident identified in March of 2019. While we have implemented additional security safeguards, including:\n\u2022\nremediation of the March 2019 incident;\n\u2022\ncooperation with U.S. Federal authorities\u2019 investigation into the incident and established an ongoing relationship to better understand the ever-changing nature of cybersecurity related threats;\n\u2022\nadditional visibility into our network and environment;\n\u2022\nadditional monitoring of our environment;\n\u2022\nactive threat hunting in our environment;\n\u2022\na reduction of our footprint of externally facing technology;\n\u2022\nenhanced protection for externally facing web applications;\n\u2022\nthe addition of Multi-Factor Authentication to ingress points;\n\u2022\nthe addition of denial of service attack protection; and\n\u2022\nincreased network segmentation,\nsuch efforts may not be successful, in which case we could suffer significant harm.\nOur contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from the studies we conduct. In the event the confidentiality of such information is compromised, whether by unauthorized access or other breaches, we could be exposed to significant harm, including termination of customer contracts, damage to our customer relationships, damage to our reputation and potential legal claims from customers, employees and other parties. In addition, we may face investigations by government regulators and agencies as a result of a breach.\nFurther, we are required to comply with the data privacy and security laws in many jurisdictions. For example, we are required to comply with the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018 and imposes heightened obligations and enhanced penalties for noncompliance (including up to four percent (4%) of global revenue). The cost of compliance, and the potential for fines and penalties for non-compliance, with GDPR may have a significant adverse effect on our business and operations. Also, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates new transparency requirements and grants California residents several new rights with regard their personal information. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. We have made changes to, and investments in, our business practices and will continue to monitor developments and make appropriate\nchanges to help attain compliance with these evolving and complex regulations. Additionally, while collecting research products from donors, we may collect, use, disclose, maintain and transmit patient information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, storage, transmission or confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information.\nContaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory, harm our reputation for contaminant-free production, result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs.\nOur research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents, such as certain viruses and bacteria, because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health. The presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminant-free research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses, including GEMS, harm our reputation for contaminant-free production and result in decreased sales. There also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our client\u2019s facilities, with similar impact to them for which we could be liable for damages. In some cases, we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans; and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection, there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection and liability for damages to infected persons.\nWe are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models. While some of these models are owned by us and maintained at our facilities, others are reserved for us and maintained at sites operated by the original provider. Accordingly, risk of contamination may be outside of our control, and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contamination-free environment. A contamination may require extended CDC quarantine with subsequent reduced sales as a result of lost client orders, as well as the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection of the affected quarantine rooms. Furthermore, while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification, the third party may refuse to fulfill its indemnification obligation or may be unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments.\nContaminations are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results. If they occur, contaminations typically require cleaning up, renovating, disinfecting, retesting and restarting production or services. Such clean-ups result in inventory loss, clean-up and start-up costs, and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments. In addition to microbiological contaminations, the potential for genetic mix-ups or mis-matings also exists and may require us to restart the applicable colonies, and would likely result in inventory loss, additional start-up costs and possibly reduced sales. Contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements.\nFurther, many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems that are subject to periodic failure, including aging fatigue. Such failures are unpredictable, and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems, strengthen our biosecurity, improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations, and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events, failures and/or contaminations may still occur.\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results, and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs.\nAny failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission on behalf of our clients to regulatory authorities. This could harm our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results. For example, the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning letter from the FDA based on a finding of a material violation affecting data integrity by us for GLP or cGMP requirements that are not addressed to the regulatory monitoring authorities\u2019 satisfaction could materially and adversely affect us. If our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations, we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.\nIn recent years FDA has issued guidance that now requires submissions to be presented in a format that conforms with the FDA\u2019s SEND (Standardization for Exchange of Nonclinical Data) standards that apply to our clients\u2019 NDA and IND submissions and require us to provide electronic data in specific formats that will allow for more efficient, higher quality regulatory reviews. Accordingly, our clients expect us to timely deliver their nonclinical data compliant with SEND. Notwithstanding, some of these standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors, but clients in the biomedical research community. Non-compliance with any of these expectations\ncould lead to official action by a government authority, damage to our reputation and a potential loss of business.\nIn addition, regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continue to evolve. Similarly, guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation, mandated contingency planning, euthanasia guidance, import and export requirements of biological materials, health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants.\nOur Research Products business is subject to extensive and complex regulation by federal, state and local governments in the U.S. and in the other countries in which it operates. This business requires us to obtain many licenses, permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates and other types of governmental permissions and to comply with various regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate. Federal, state and local regulations change often, and new regulations are frequently adopted. Changes in the regulations could require us to change the way in which we operate our business and the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant.\nOur donor collection centers are registered with the FDA and the FDA periodically conducts inspections of those facilities and operations. At the conclusion of each inspection, the FDA provides us with a list of observations of regulatory issues discovered during the inspection that could result in additional regulatory action. Failure to comply with the regulations of the FDA could result in sanctions and/or remedies and have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe outsourcing trend in non-clinical (discovery and safety assessment) stages of drug discovery and development may decrease, which could impair our growth.\nOver the past decade, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of non-clinical research support activities, such as discovery and safety assessment. While many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years (although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development), decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently influenced outsourcing demand from our clients, please see the section entitled \u201cOur Strategy\u201d included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nChanges in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries, including potential healthcare reform, could decrease the need for the services we provide.\nGovernmental agencies throughout the world strictly regulate the drug development process. Our business involves helping our customers navigate these regulatory processes. Accordingly, many regulations, and often new regulations, are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries. However, some changes in regulations, such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services.\nAlthough we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable national, regional and local laws, as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies (including the USDA, the standards set by the International Air Transport Association, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, The Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Transportation, the Department of State, the office of Laboratory Animal Welfare of NIH, the Drug Enforcement Agency, as well as numerous other oversight agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate), failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. In addition, if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures that utilize laboratory animals (as has been advocated by certain groups), certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIn March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted healthcare reform legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which includes provisions impacting drug manufacturers, such as (1) the expansion of access to health insurance coverage, (2) the expansion of the Medicaid program, (3) the enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies and (4) the imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in 2017, repeals the ACA\u2019s individual health insurance mandate, which is considered a key component of the ACA. Since the ACA and its implementation continue to face challenges in Congress and federal courts, and from certain state governments, opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations, the ultimate effects of this legislation are unclear on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future.\nImplementation of healthcare reform legislation may have certain benefits, but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. This could adversely affect R&D expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase our costs or limit our service offerings. Furthermore, if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products, our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on R&D.\nWhile it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level, or in laws and regulations in effect in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or have business relationships, may significantly impact our domestic and foreign businesses and/or those of our clients. Furthermore, modifications to international trade policy, public company reporting requirements, environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement may have a materially adverse impact on us, our suppliers or our clients.\nWe bear financial risk for contracts that may be terminated or reduced in scope, underpriced, subject to cost overruns or delayed.\nMany of our agreements, including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant clients, provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice. In addition, we sell our products and services to our competitors, and similarly they sell products and services to us. For instance, we have historically entered into, and currently are party to, contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities.\nOur counterparties (including our clients who are competitors) may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including:\n\u2022\nthe products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements;\n\u2022\nunexpected or undesired study results;\n\u2022\nproduction problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested;\n\u2022\na client\u2019s decision to forego or terminate a particular study;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 establishment of alternative distribution channels;\n\u2022\ndissatisfaction with our performance under the agreement;\n\u2022\nthe loss of funding for the particular research study; or\n\u2022\ngeneral convenience/counterparty preference.\nIf a counterparty terminates a contract with us, we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and, in some cases, termination fees. Cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay, cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and, therefore, may adversely affect our operating results.\nFurthermore, many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and, accordingly, we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates. Such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have an adverse effect on the our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire, or in managing our current and future divestitures, our business may be adversely impacted.\nDuring the last two decades, we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions of Citoxlab and HemaCare. We plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances. However, businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. We risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners, but not completing transactions.\nAcquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving business and financial success;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations, services, products, technologies or pre-existing relationships with our clients, distributors and suppliers;\n\u2022\nchallenges with developing and operating new businesses, including those that are materially different from our existing businesses and that may require the development or acquisition of new internal capabilities and expertise;\n\u2022\npotential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller or the insurance we acquire in connection with the transaction;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees;\n\u2022\nthe presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\na more expansive regulatory environment;\n\u2022\nacquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company, dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\ndifferences in foreign business practices, customs and importation regulations, language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies;\n\u2022\nnew technologies and products may be developed that cause businesses or assets we acquire to become less valuable; and\n\u2022\ndisagreements or disputes with prior owners of an acquired business, technology, service or product that may result in litigation expenses and diversion of our management\u2019s attention.\nIf an acquired business, technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nSome of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business, site or product line. In addition, divestitures could involve additional risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nthe need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture.\nWe continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses (including specific product lines and service offerings) to determine whether any divestitures are appropriate. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms, and in a timely manner. We may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business, site or product line or service offering and, as a result, we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture.\nImpairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations.\nWe have intangible assets, including goodwill, on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses. The initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates. These estimates are based on, among other factors, projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets. Disruptions in global financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could, among other things, impact the discount rate. Other assumptions used in the valuations and actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows, which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such assets.\nIf the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated, overall macroeconomic or industry conditions deteriorate and/or our market capitalization declines, this could impact the assumptions used in establishing the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets. To the extent goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, their carrying value will be written down to their implied fair values and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations. Such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results. As of December 28, 2019, the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet was $2.2 billion.\nOur business is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks relating to operating internationally.\nA significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the U.S. We expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates, could materially adversely impact our results. Foreign currencies we receive for sales and in which we record expenses outside the U.S. could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the U.S. dollar, resulting in a reduction in the amount of revenue and cash flow (and an increase in the amount of expenses) that we recognize and causing fluctuations in reported financial results. We also carry foreign currency exposure associated with differences between where we conduct business. For example, certain contracts are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts. Where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced, fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results from the currency translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as from the exposure associated with transactions of our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiary\u2019s functional currency. While our financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency. During consolidation, these results are translated into U.S. Dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currencies in which our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our reported results. Moreover, as exchange rates vary, revenue and other operating results may differ materially from our expectations. Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as a separate component of shareholders\u2019 equity.\nOther risks associated with our international business include:\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in U.S. and/or foreign tax laws, or interpretations thereof, notably tax regulations issued and to-be-issued with respect to U.S. Tax Reform and the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives I and II;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate, including possible implications of Brexit;\n\u2022\npotential international conflicts, including terrorist acts;\n\u2022\nexchange controls, adverse tax consequences and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the U.S.;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including risks of work stoppages and/or strikes, as well as violations of local laws or anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nunfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with export controls, import requirements and other trade regulations, including those relating to certain products of which there is limited supply.\nThese risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, as mentioned above, we are subject to compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their third-party intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the\npurpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees, distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nWe depend on our customers and facilities for the continued operation of our business. While we maintain disaster recovery plans, they might not adequately protect us. Despite any precautions we take for natural disasters or other catastrophic events, these events, including terrorist attack, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a disease (including coronavirus), hurricanes, fire, floods and ice and snow storms, could result in damage to and closure of our or our customers\u2019 facilities or the infrastructure on which such facilities rely. Such disruptions could significant delays in the shipments of our products, reduce our capacity to provide services, eradicate unique manufacturing capabilities, result in our customers\u2019 inability to pay for our products or services and, ultimately, result in the loss of revenue and clients. Although we carry business interruption insurance policies and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events, our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us or our customers could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial performance.\nFailure to comply with U.S., state, local or international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including regulations issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Nuclear Regulatory Agency and Department of Transportation, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business.\nWe are subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us that may be costly.\nNew technologies may be developed, validated and increasingly used in biomedical research, which could reduce demand for some of our products and services.\nThe scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved cellular and animal model systems that would increase the translation to human studies and vice-versa and possibly replace or supplement the use of traditional living animals as test platforms in biomedical research. Some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit to improve translation between species. In addition, technological improvements to existing or new processes, such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies, could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from non-clinical to clinical studies. There is an increasing push to focus on in vitro technologies such that employ human biospecimens, stem cell technologies and genome editing.\nIt is our strategy to explore these in vitro technologies to refine and potentially reduce the utilization of animal models as these new methods become validated. For example, our Discovery and Safety Assessment businesses have programs to evaluate the utility of induced pluripotent stems cells, advanced in vitro models, artificial intelligence and machine learning in discovery and preclinical development. Successful commercialization of alternatives to traditional research models may not be sufficient to fully offset reduced sales or profits from research models. In addition, alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models, and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales. Lastly, other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce, and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients.\nNegative attention from special interest groups may impair our business.\nThe products and services that we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery, development and manufacturing processes, and a significant amount are mandated by law. Notwithstanding, certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes. Historically, our core research model activities with rats, mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention. However, research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention, including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt air carriers from transporting research models, impacting the industry. This has included periodic demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our\nannual meetings, as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past Annual Meetings of Shareholders. Any negative attention, threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our third-party service providers, such as our airline carriers, in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently.\nOur debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had $1.9 billion of debt. Our debt could have significant adverse effects on our business, including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt; limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities; and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates. For additional information regarding our debt, please see Note 9, \u201cLong-Term Debt and Finance Lease Obligations\u201d, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe interest rate on our $2.3 billion credit facility (Credit Facility), which matures in fiscal year 2023, is linked to LIBOR. As of December 28, 2019, amounts outstanding on our Credit Facility were $193.8 million on our term loan and $676.1 million on our revolving credit facility, for which there is an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $2.05 billion. In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. If LIBOR ceases to exist, the method and rate used to calculate our interest rates and/or payments on our debt in the future may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, or that do not otherwise correlate over time with, the interest rates and/or payments that would have been applicable to our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. While we continue to take steps to mitigate the impact of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR, such efforts may not prove successful. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nCosts increasing more rapidly than market prices could reduce profitability.\nThe cost of collecting, processing and testing blood products has risen significantly in recent years and will likely continue to increase. These cost increases are related to new and improved testing procedures, increased regulatory requirements related to blood safety, and higher staff and supply costs related to collecting and processing blood products. Competition and fixed price contracts may limit our ability to maintain existing operating margins. Some competitors have greater resources than us to sustain periods of marginally profitable or unprofitable sales. Costs increasing more rapidly than market prices may reduce profitability and may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete for business with other CROs and blood product and therapeutic services companies, as well as internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients, who may have greater resources than ours. We also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services. We compete on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nreputation for on-time quality performance;\n\u2022\nreputation for regulatory compliance;\n\u2022\nexpertise and experience in multiple specialized areas;\n\u2022\nscope and breadth of service and product offerings across the drug discovery and development spectrum;\n\u2022\nscope and breadth of service and product offerings across the manufacturing support spectrum;\n\u2022\nability to provide flexible and customized solutions to support our clients\u2019 drug discovery, non-clinical development, and manufacturing support needs;\n\u2022\nbroad geographic availability (with consistent quality);\n\u2022\nprice/value, spend and flexibility;\n\u2022\ntechnological and scientific expertise and efficient drug development processes;\n\u2022\nquality of facilities;\n\u2022\nfinancial stability;\n\u2022\nsize;\n\u2022\nability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in an accurate manner; and\n\u2022\naccessibility of client data through secure portals.\nIf we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. Increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that could adversely affect our operating results. The drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation, particularly among the biotechnology companies, which are targets for each other and for large pharmaceutical companies. If this trend continues, it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and CROs generally, with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates. In addition, small, specialized entities considering entering the CRO industries will continue to find lower barriers to entry, and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies, thus further increasing possible competition. More generally, our competitors or others might develop technologies, services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies, services or products, or that render our technologies, services or products less competitive or obsolete. If competitors introduce superior technologies, services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive, our competitive position, and in turn our business, revenue and financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected. In the aggregate, these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies, services or products and could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in U.S. and International Tax Law.\nIn 2017, significant U.S. tax law changes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (U.S. Tax Reform) went into effect and reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, broadened the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions, exclusions and credits, limited the ability of U.S. corporations to deduct interest expense and allowed for the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. with a 100% federal dividends received deduction prospectively. In addition, U.S. Tax Reform required a one-time transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings. Several of the new provisions enacted as part of U.S. Tax Reform still require clarification and guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Treasury Department. These or other changes in U.S. tax laws could impact our profits, effective tax rate and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the OECD, the European Commission (EC) and individual taxing jurisdictions have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. The OECD released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of rules to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). This initiative resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and the U.K. In addition, the OECD and EC and individual countries are examining how taxing rights should be allocated among countries considering the digital economy. Future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from enacted laws could increase our effective tax rate, which would affect our profitability.\nWe receive substantial tax credits in Canada, from both the Canadian federal and Quebec governments, France and the U.K. Any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or increase to tax rates due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits, cash flows and effective tax rate.\nContract research services create a risk of liability.\nAs a CRO, we face a range of potential liabilities, which may include:\n\u2022\nrisks associated with errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in non-clinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports, which may undermine the usefulness of a study or data from the study, or which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support or inhibit studies from proceeding to the next level of testing;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our clients\u2019 property, such as research models and samples, study compounds, records, work in progress, other archived materials or goods and materials in transit, while in our possession;\n\u2022\nrisks that models in our breeding facilities or in facilities that we manage may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to them or humans, despite preventive measures for the quarantine and handling of imported animals;\n\u2022\nrisks that we may have errors and omissions and/or product liabilities related to our products designed to conduct\nlot release testing of medical devices, injectable drugs, food, beverages and home and beauty products (primarily through our Microbial Solutions business), or in the testing of biologics and other services performed by our Biologics business, which could result in us or our clients failing to identify unsafe or contaminated materials; and\n\u2022\nrisk of transmitting dangerous infectious diseases, as a result of the failure of our screening and testing processes, or new pathogens that may be undetected by such processes.\nWhile we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods, it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks. In our RMS business, we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing, quarantine procedures and veterinary staff vigilance, through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections. In our DSA and Manufacturing businesses, we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified by our clients and subject to a limitation of liability, by insurance maintained by our clients and/or by us and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business.\nContractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions, such as negligence or misconduct. We could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision, or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage. We also often contractually indemnify our clients (subject to a limitation of liability), similar to the way they indemnify us, and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations. Furthermore, either we or a party required to indemnify us may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage (either at all or on terms acceptable to us).\nUpgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions.\nIn recent years, we have been updating and consolidating systems and automating processes in many parts of our business with a variety of systems, including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses. The expansion and ongoing implementation of the systems may occur at a future date based on value to the business. In general, the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated, wide-scale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges, including information security assessment and remediation, data conversion, network and system cutover and user training. Problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments, missed sales, billing errors and accounting errors.\nThe failure to successfully obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights and defend against challenges to our intellectual property rights could adversely affect us.\nMany of our services, products and processes rely on intellectual property. In some cases, that intellectual property is owned by another party and licensed to us, sometimes exclusively. To protect our intellectual property rights, we primarily rely upon trade secret law, confidentiality agreements and policies, invention assignments and other contractual arrangements, along with patent, copyright and trademark laws. Existing laws of certain countries outside of the United States in which we operate offer only limited protection, and these are subject to change at any time. In addition, the agreements upon which we rely to protect our intellectual property might be breached, or might not be fully enforceable. Our intellectual property rights might not prevent our competitors from independently developing intellectual property that is similar to or duplicative of ours. Also, enforcing our intellectual property rights might also require substantial time, money and oversight, and we might not be successful in enforcing our rights. If we are unable to obtain or maintain the proprietary rights to our intellectual property, if we are unable to prevent attempted infringement against our intellectual property, or if we are unable to defend against claims that we are infringing on another party\u2019s intellectual property, we could be adversely affected. These adverse effects could include us having to abandon, alter or delay the deployment of products, services or processes that rely on such intellectual property; having to procure and pay for licenses from the holders of intellectual property rights that we seek to use; and having to pay damages, fines, court costs and attorney's fees in connection with intellectual property litigation.\nFurther, the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue. Legal proceedings relating to intellectual property are expensive, take significant time, and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, whether we win or lose. If we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products.\nWe may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings. We believe our ability to in-license new technologies from third parties will be critical to our ability to offer new\nproducts and services to our clients. Our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends, in part, on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our clients. Even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest, we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to develop new services and products and/or create demand for those newly developed services and products, our future business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe decision by British voters to exit the European Union may adversely affect our business.\nThe first stage of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) took place on January 31, 2020, when the U.K. left the European Union and entered a transition phase. During the transition phase, the U.K. needs to negotiate the terms of its future trading and other relationships with the European Union. The scope and timing of these negotiations have created significant uncertainty and continue to do so. The U.K. Prime Minister has said that a trade agreement needs to be reached by December 31, 2020. There is currently no mechanism to automatically extend the transition period, but there is a possibility that the transition period may be extended by agreement between the U.K. and the European Union.\nGiven the continuing uncertainty concerning the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the European Union, including the possibility that there may still be no negotiated agreement despite the results of the December 2019 general election, we have formed a committee (comprised of senior managers across our business functions) to address key risks among four main themes: (1) trade and customs, (2) employees and immigration, (3) strategy and business planning and (4) legislative changes. That committee will continue until the situation is clarified.\nIn the absence of a trade deal in the short to medium term, the U.K.\u2019s trade with the European Union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization. Additionally, the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the European Union will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. These changes to the trading relationship between the U.K and European Union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the U.K. and may decrease the profitability of our U.K. and other operations. Additional currency volatility could drive a weaker British pound, which increases the cost of goods imported into our U.K. operations and may decrease the profitability of our U.K. operations. A weaker British pound versus the U.S. dollar also causes local currency results of our U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars during a reporting period. Although we are undertaking efforts to mitigate those risks within our control, a failure to adequately mitigate such risks or other factors outside our control could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management. James C. Foster, our Chief Executive Officer and President since 1992 and Chairman since 2000, has held various positions with us for four decades. While we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Foster in 2018, most members of our senior management do not have employment agreements. If Mr. Foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions, our business may be adversely impacted.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. While we have a strong record of employee retention, and we strive to reduce the impact of the potential loss of existing employees by having an established organizational talent review process that identifies successors and potential talent needs, there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary, pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields. Therefore, we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. The loss of the services of existing personnel, as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner, could harm our business.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by the risks discussed above, as well as:\n\u2022\nchanges in the general global economy;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of our products and services;\n\u2022\ncyclical buying patterns of our clients;\n\u2022\nthe financial performance of our venture capital investments; and\n\u2022\nthe occasional extra week (\u201c53rd week\u201d) that we recognize in a fiscal year (and fourth fiscal quarter thereof) due to our fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.\nWe believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. Nonetheless, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nSince we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, earnings and other factors. Consequently, our shareholders should not rely on dividends to receive a return on their investment.", "PERMNO": 88281, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "CRL"}
