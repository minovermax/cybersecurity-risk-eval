{"cik": "1468328", "company": "Addus HomeCare Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nAny of the risks described below, and the risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and cause the actual outcome of matters to differ materially from our current expectations as reflected in forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K. The risk factors described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may also be materially adversely affected by factors that are not currently known to us, by factors that we currently consider immaterial or by factors that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nYou should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements under \u201cSpecial Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and External Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our operations, business and financial condition, and our liquidity could also be negatively impacted, particularly if the U.S. economy remains unstable for a significant amount of time.\nOn January 31, 2020, the Secretary of HHS declared a national public health emergency due to a novel coronavirus. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by this novel coronavirus, a pandemic. The disease continues to spread throughout the United States and other parts of the world. The spread of COVID-19 has caused many states and cities to declare states of emergency or disaster proclamations, including the state of Texas and the city of Frisco, where we are headquartered. State and local governments, together with public health officials, have recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including the closure of public facilities and parks, schools, restaurants, many businesses and other locations of public assembly. As a result, COVID-19 continues to affect the overall economic conditions in the United States. Although many of the restrictions have eased across the country, some areas are re-imposing closures and other restrictions, as a result of increasing rates of COVID-19 infection. There are no reliable estimates of how long the pandemic will last, how many people are likely to be affected by it or the duration or types of restrictions that will be imposed or re-imposed. For these and other reasons, we are unable to predict the long-term impact of the pandemic on our business at this time.\nRelevant authorities have universally designated our services as \u201cessential,\u201d exempting our services and providers from many of the restrictions of the orders described above. However, our home health and hospice providers have experienced difficulty in accessing facility-based patients because of concerns about the spread of COVID-19, and we expect that this difficulty will continue. As front-line providers of healthcare services and personal care services, our employees that contract COVID-19 could be unable to continue to perform their duties, and we could face litigation if our employees or customers contract COVID-19 while our employees perform their duties. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to protecting the health and well-being, and meeting the needs, of our patients, employees, and contractors as we implement operational changes in response to the pandemic. Staffing, equipment, pharmaceutical and medical supplies shortages may impact our ability to schedule and treat patients. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, the extent of future impact will depend on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, the rollout and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines, and the impact of any mutations of the virus.\nIf general economic conditions deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has previously caused disruption in the financial markets and the businesses of financial institutions and may do so again, potentially causing a slowdown in the decision-making of these institutions. This may affect the timing on which we may obtain any additional funding and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Additionally, the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic poses significant risks to states\u2019 budgets for the 2021 fiscal year, which began July 1 in most states. Depending on the severity and length of a downturn, sales tax collections and income tax withholdings could continue to be depressed in fiscal 2021 and, potentially, future fiscal years. States could face significant fiscal challenges and may have no choice but to revise their revenue forecasts and adjust their budgets for fiscal 2021 and, potentially, future fiscal years, accordingly. For example, in New York, which started its fiscal year April 1, the state comptroller recently estimated that the state would collect at least $10 billion less than originally forecasted, the first year-to-year cut since 2011. The current New York fiscal plan authorizes the state of New York to issue up to $8 billion in short-term bonds to provide funds in case of reduced revenues during the fiscal year. The state issued $1.1 billion of bonds on October 28, 2020. The New York fiscal plan also allows two state authorities to provide the state with a $3 billion line of credit in the new fiscal year. Congress could provide additional relief with additional stimulus and relief legislation, including extension of unemployment benefits and relief for states. We cannot determine the impact that COVID-19 may have on states budgets for 2021 or beyond, however, such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in an adverse effect on our business, result of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could heighten the risks in certain of the other risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial assistance we may receive from future stimulus legislation, if any, or that we will be able to benefit from provisions intended to increase access to resources and ease regulatory burdens for healthcare providers or that additional stimulus legislation will be enacted.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act and the CAA authorize a total of $178 billion in funding to be distributed to health care providers through the Provider Relief Fund. These funds are intended to reimburse eligible providers, including public entities and Medicare and/or Medicaid-enrolled providers and suppliers, for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. The Company has acquired and may in the future acquire companies that have received funds from the Provider Relief Fund. HHS has not yet allocated or distributed all funds from the Provider Relief Fund, so the potential future impact to the Company is unclear. The Company has also received amounts from the Provider Relief Fund and utilized a portion of those funds to offset increased healthcare related expenses attributable to COVID-19 that were unreimbursed by other sources, but our ability to utilize and retain some or all of these remaining funds will depend on the magnitude, timing and nature of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and that the terms and conditions related to the funds received will not change or be interpreted in ways that impact our ability to comply with such terms and conditions in the future. We continue to evaluate the terms and conditions and the financial impact of funds received under the CARES Act, the Provider Relief Fund and other government relief programs. We expect that recipients of these funds will be subject to significant scrutiny by the federal government, and note that recipients of Provider Relief Fund payments are subject to audit requirements. We have structured and will continue to structure our use of these funds in accordance with the terms and conditions, but federal regulators may disagree with our interpretation of these terms and conditions and require that we repay some or all amounts received at our facilities and pay or impose other penalties.\nThe CARES Act also makes other forms of financial assistance available to healthcare providers, including through Medicare and Medicaid payment adjustments and an expansion of the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program, which makes available advance payments of Medicare funds in order to increase cash flow to providers. Hospice and home health providers were able to request an advance or accelerated payment of up to 100% of the Medicare payment amount for a three-month period (not including Medicare Advantage payments). In addition to financial assistance, the CARES Act and related legislation include provisions intended to increase access to medical supplies and equipment and ease legal and regulatory burdens on healthcare providers, as well as certain federal income and other tax changes, including the deferral of the employer portion of Social Security payroll taxes.\nMany of these measures, such as flexibilities related to the provision of telehealth services, are effective only for the duration of the public health emergency. The current public health emergency determination expires April 21, 2021, but HHS has indicated it will likely extend through 2021. The HHS Secretary may choose to renew the declaration for successive 90-day periods for as long as the emergency continues to exist and may terminate the declaration whenever he determines that the public health emergency no longer exists. It is unclear for how long the public health emergency declaration will be extended. The CARES Act also includes numerous income tax provisions including changes to the net operating loss rules and business interest expense deduction rules.\nDue to the enactment of the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act, the CAA and other stimulus legislation, there is still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding their implementation, and the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The federal government is considering additional stimulus efforts, but we are unable to predict whether additional stimulus measures will be enacted or their impact. There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial and other types of assistance we will receive under existing or future legislation, if any, and it is difficult to predict the impact of such legislation on our operations or how it will affect operations of our competitors. Further, there can be no assurance that the terms of the Provider Relief Fund or other programs will not change in ways that affect funding we may receive or our eligibility to participate. We continue to assess the potential impact of COVID-19 and government responses to the pandemic, including the enactment and implementation of the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act, the CAA and other stimulus legislation, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be more vulnerable to the effects of a public health emergency than other businesses due to the nature of our consumers and the physical proximity required by our operations.\nThe majority of our consumers and patients are older individuals, many of whom may be more vulnerable than the general public during a pandemic or in a public health emergency due to complex medical conditions or other socioeconomic factors. Our employees are also at greater risk of contracting contagious diseases due to their increased exposure to vulnerable consumers. Our employees could also have difficulty attending to our consumers if a program of social distancing or quarantine is instituted in response to a public health emergency. In addition, the Company may expand existing internal policies in a manner that may have a similar effect. If another pandemic were to occur, or the existing COVID-19 pandemic does not abate or worsens, we could suffer significant losses to our consumer population or a reduction in the availability of our employees and, at a high cost, be required to hire\nreplacements for affected workers. Since December 2019, as noted above, the COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, has resulted in travel disruption and affected business operations across the world, among other significant effects. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, older adults and people with certain underlying medical conditions are at a higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19. Although the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations has been minimal, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our results in the longer term is uncertain. Accordingly, certain public health emergencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Growth Strategy\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to manage growing and effectively integrating operations and we may not be successful in managing this growth.\nOur business plan calls for significant growth in business over the next several years through the expansion of our services in existing markets and the establishment of a presence in new markets. This growth has placed and continues to place significant demands on our management team, systems, internal controls and financial and professional resources. In addition, we will need to further develop our financial controls and reporting systems to accommodate our growth. This could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure. Our inability to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nPreviously completed or future acquisitions, or growth initiatives, may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nOur growth strategy includes geographical expansion into new markets and the addition of new services in existing markets through the acquisition of local service providers. These acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties assimilating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees or consumers of acquired providers, regulatory risks, the assumption of liabilities, exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired providers, and the diversion of the management team\u2019s attention. In the past, we have made acquisitions that have not performed as expected or that we have been unable to successfully integrate with our existing operations. In addition, our due diligence review of acquired businesses may not successfully identify all potential issues. Further, following completion of an acquisition, we may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we and the acquired business have achieved or might achieve separately. While we continue to seek out and pursue acquisition opportunities, we are doing so with additional caution and diligence due to COVID-19 considerations. The failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe have grown our business through de novo offices and we may in the future selectively open new offices in existing and new states. De novo offices involve risks, including those relating to licensing, accreditation, and payor program enrollment, hiring new personnel, establishing relationships with referral sources and delays or difficulty in installing our operating and information systems. We may not be successful in generating sufficient business activity to sustain the operating costs of such de novo operations.\nWe may be unable to pursue acquisitions or expand into new geographic regions without obtaining additional capital or consent from our lenders.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash balances of $145.1 million and $111.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $196.6 million and $43.4 million outstanding debt on our credit facility, respectively. After giving effect to the amount drawn on our credit facility, approximately $9.0 million and $10.0 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and borrowing limits based on an advanced multiple of adjusted EBITDA, we had $112.6 million and $137.4 million available for borrowing under our credit facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Since our credit facility provides for borrowings based on a multiple of an EBITDA ratio, any declines in our EBITDA would result in a decrease in our available borrowings under our credit facility.\nWe cannot predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts, our efforts to expand into new geographic regions or the associated capital commitments. If we do not have sufficient cash resources or availability under our credit facility, our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing. In the future, we may elect to issue additional equity securities in conjunction with raising capital, completing an acquisition or expanding into a new geographic region. For example, on September 9, 2019, we completed a public offering of an aggregate 2,300,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, including 300,000 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares at a public offering price of $79.50 per share (the \u201cPublic Offering\u201d). We used approximately $130.0 million from the net proceeds of the Public Offering to fund the purchase price for our acquisition of Hospice Partners on October 1, 2019 and used the remaining net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes and to fund, in part, 2020 acquisitions. Such issuances could be dilutive to existing shareholders. In addition, our ability under our credit facility to consummate acquisitions is restricted if we exceed certain\nTotal Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement, and subject to adjustments as provided therein) thresholds, without the consent of the lenders; provided, however, in certain circumstances, in connection with a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement), we can elect to increase our Total Net Leverage Ratio compliance covenant for the then current fiscal quarter and the three succeeding fiscal quarters. Further, our credit facility requires, among other things, that we are in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth therein and that no event of default exists before and after giving effect to any proposed acquisition. Our ability to expand in a manner consistent with historic practices may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consent from our lenders.\nBusiness Risks\nTiming differences in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems.\nWe fund operations primarily through the collection of accounts receivable, but there is a delay between the time that we provide services and the time that we receive reimbursement or payment for these services. These delays may result from such factors as changes by payors to data submission requirements, requests by fiscal intermediaries for additional data or documentation, other Medicare or Medicaid issues, or information system problems, which may adversely impact our working capital. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in our results of operations and liquidity. Our working capital management procedures may not successfully negate this risk. Delays in receiving reimbursement or payments from Medicare, Medicaid and other payors may adversely impact our working capital. Further, many of the states in which we operate are operating with budget deficits for their current fiscal year and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic likely will increase state deficits. These and other states may in the future delay reimbursement, which would adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, from time to time, procedural issues require us to resubmit claims before payment is remitted, which contributes to our aged receivables. Additionally, unanticipated delays in receiving reimbursement from state programs due to changes in their policies or billing or audit procedures may adversely impact our liquidity and working capital.\nWe are and have been subject to routine and periodic surveys, audits and investigations by various governmental agencies. In addition to surveys to determine compliance with the conditions of participation, CMS has engaged a number of contractors (including Medicare Administrative Contractors (\"MACs\"), RACs and UPICs) to conduct audits to evaluate billing practices and identify overpayments. These audits can result in recoupments by Medicare and other payors of amounts previously paid to us. In addition to audits by CMS contractors, individual states are implementing similar integrity programs using Medicaid RACs. We are unable to predict what additional government regulations, if any, affecting our business may be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations either in the markets in which we presently conduct, or wish to commence, business. In June 2019, CMS began the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services in Illinois to identify and prevent fraud, reduce the number of Medicare appeals, and improve provider compliance with Medicare program requirements. The demonstration expanded to Ohio in September 2019 and to Texas in March 2020. Home health agencies may initially select from the following claims review and approval processes: pre-claim review, post-payment review, or a minimal post-payment review with a 25% payment reduction. Home health agencies that maintain high compliance levels will be eligible for additional, less burdensome options. Beginning in March 2020, CMS temporarily paused certain claims processing for the Review Choice Demonstration due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the agency resumed its activities under the demonstration in August 2020. CMS is in the process of expanding the Review Choice Demonstration to North Carolina and Florida, but is phasing in participation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are currently unable to predict what impact, if any, this program may have on our result of operations or financial position.\nOur revenues are concentrated in a small number of states which makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states.\nOur revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in states in which we generate a significant portion of our revenues including Illinois, New York and New Mexico. Accordingly, any change in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes to the Medicaid programs in these states could also have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, New York and Illinois have been some of the most significantly impacted areas to date by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could also have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nEfforts to reduce the costs of the Illinois Department on Aging programs could adversely affect our service revenues and profitability.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we derived approximately 23.0% and 25.3%, respectively, of our revenue from the Illinois Department on Aging programs. In the past, state government officials have attempted to reduce government spending by proposing changes aimed at reducing expenditures by this department. The current governor, who took office in January\n2019, has continued the pursuit of cost reduction initiatives. The nature and extent of any proposed future cost reduction initiatives is unknown. If future reforms impact the eligibility of consumers for services, the number of hours authorized or otherwise restrict services provided to existing consumers, our service revenues, results of operations, financial position and growth may be adversely affected.\nFailure to renew a significant payor agreement or group of related payor agreements may materially impact our revenue.\nEach of our agreements is generally in effect for a specific term, but they are also generally terminable with 60 days\u2019 notice. Our ability to renew or retain our agreements depends on our quality of service and reputation, as well as other factors over which we have little or no control, such as state appropriations and changes in provider eligibility requirements. Additionally, failure to satisfy any of the numerous technical renewal requirements in connection with our proposals for agreements could result in a proposal being rejected even if it contains favorable pricing terms. Failure to obtain, renew or retain agreements with major payors may negatively impact our results of operations and revenue. We can give no assurance these agreements will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nNegative publicity or changes in public perception of our services may adversely affect our ability to receive referrals, obtain new agreements and renew existing agreements.\nOur success in receiving referrals, obtaining new agreements and renewing our existing agreements depends upon maintaining our reputation as a quality service provider among governmental authorities, physicians, hospitals, discharge planning departments, case managers, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, advocacy groups, consumers and their families, other referral sources and the public. While we believe that the services that we provide are of high quality, if our quality measures, which are published online by CMS, are deemed to be not of the highest value, our reputation could be negatively affected. Negative publicity, changes in public perceptions of our services or government investigations of our operations could damage our reputation and hinder our ability to receive referrals, retain agreements or obtain new agreements. Increased government scrutiny may also contribute to an increase in compliance costs and could discourage consumers from using our services. Any of these events could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business may be harmed by labor relations matters.\nWe are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because our hourly workforce is highly unionized. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 47.3% of our workforce was represented by the SEIU. We have numerous agreements with local SEIU affiliates which are renegotiated from time to time. These negotiations are often initiated when we receive increases in our hourly rates from various state agencies. Upon expiration of these collective bargaining agreements, we may not be able to negotiate labor agreements on satisfactory terms with these labor unions. A strike, work stoppage or other slowdown could result in a disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs, which could adversely affect our business. Labor costs are the most significant component of our total expenditures and, therefore, an increase in the cost of labor could significantly harm our business.\nIf we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill and/or our intangible assets, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nGoodwill and intangible assets with finite lives represent a significant portion of our assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. For example, if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. If as part of our annual review of goodwill and intangibles, we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected, which could affect our flexibility to obtain additional financing. In addition, if our assumptions used in preparing our valuations for purposes of impairment testing differ materially from actual future results, we may record impairment charges in the future and our financial results may be materially adversely affected. We had $469.1 million and $275.4 million of goodwill and $71.5 million and $57.1 million of intangible assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIt is not possible at this time to determine if there will be any future impairment charge, or if there is, whether such charges would be material. We will continue to review our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment. We cannot be certain that a downturn in our business or changes in market conditions will not result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets and the recognition of resulting expenses in future periods, which could adversely affect our results of operations for those periods.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, such failure could adversely impact our business and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires our management to report on, and requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nCompliance with SEC regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has increased our legal and financial compliance costs making some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nAccordingly, we are required to have an audit of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management previously determined that a material weakness in our internal control existed as of December 31, 2018, and that two additional material weaknesses existed as of December 31, 2019. Although each of these material weaknesses was remediated as of December 31, 2020 and management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of that date, as discussed in Item 9A of Part II of this Form 10-K, we cannot assure you that we will not identify another material weakness in the future\nTo the extent that we now or in the future have deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are not remediated, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or key operating metrics could be impaired, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements, late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of our consolidated financial statements or other corrective disclosures, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity and could create a perception that our financial results do not fairly state our financial condition or results of operations, any of which could have an adverse effect on the value of our stock.\nCompliance with changing regulations including specific program compliance, corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses and pose challenges for our management team.\nThe state agencies that contract for our services require our compliance with various rules and regulations affecting the services we provide. We have a compliance officer who monitors and reports on our efforts for achieving the desired results. State agencies are recommending increased rules and regulations in an effort to control the growth of these programs and their overall costs. The implementation of these changes may require us to increase our efforts to remain compliant, may reduce the authorizations for services to be provided, and may result in certain consumers no longer being eligible for our services all of which may result in lower revenues and increased costs, reducing our operating performance and profitability. If we continue to serve our consumers without addressing these increased regulations we are at risk for non-compliance with program requirements and potential penalties.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. We are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nRegulatory and Regulatory Risks\nOur hospice operations are subject to annual Medicare caps. If we exceed the caps, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOverall payments made by Medicare to each hospice provider number (generally corresponding to each of our hospice agencies) are subject to an inpatient cap and an aggregate cap, which are set each federal fiscal year. The inpatient cap limits the number of days of inpatient care to no more than 20% of total patient care days. The aggregate cap limits the amount of Medicare reimbursement a hospice may receive, based on the number of Medicare patients served. If a hospice\u2019s Medicare payments exceed its inpatient or aggregate caps, it must repay Medicare for the excess amount. If payments received under any of our hospice provider numbers exceed these caps, we may be required to reimburse Medicare such excess amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nReductions in reimbursement and other changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal, state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our consumer caseload, units of service, revenues, gross profit and profitability.\nA significant portion of our caseload and revenues are derived from government healthcare programs, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 56.4% of our net service revenues from state and local governmental agencies, primarily through Medicaid state programs. However, changes in government healthcare programs may decrease the reimbursement we receive or limit access to, or utilization of, our services. As federal healthcare expenditures continue to increase and state governments face budgetary shortfalls, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal and state governments have made, and may continue to make, significant changes to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and reimbursement\nreceived for services rendered to beneficiaries of such programs. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. CMS began imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims in April 2013, and these reductions have been extended through 2030, although the CARES Act and related stimulus legislation temporarily suspends this 2% reduction from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021.\nThe Medicaid program, which is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, is often a state\u2019s largest program. Governmental agencies generally condition their agreements upon a sufficient budgetary appropriation. Almost all of the states in which we operate have experienced periodic financial pressures and budgetary shortfalls due to challenging economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19, and the rising costs of healthcare. Reductions to federal support for state Medicaid or other programs could also result in budgetary shortfalls. As a result, many states have made, are considering or may consider making changes in their Medicaid or other state and local medical and social programs, including enacting legislation designed to reduce Medicaid expenditures.\nChanges that may occur at the federal or state level to address budget deficits or otherwise contain costs include:\n\u2022\nlimiting increases in, or decreasing, reimbursement rates;\n\u2022\nredefining eligibility standards or coverage criteria for social and medical programs or the receipt of services under those programs;\n\u2022\nincreasing consumer responsibility, including through increased co-payment requirements;\n\u2022\ndecreasing benefits, such as limiting the number of hours of personal care services that will be covered;\n\u2022\nchanging reimbursement methodology and program participation eligibility;\n\u2022\nslowing payments to providers;\n\u2022\nincreasing utilization of self-directed care alternatives or \u201call inclusive\u201d programs;\n\u2022\nshifting beneficiaries to managed care organizations; and\n\u2022\nimplementing demonstration projects and alternative payment models.\nCertain of these measures have been implemented by, or are proposed in, states in which we operate. For example, we provide support services as a fiscal intermediary to the New York Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (\u201cCDPAP\u201d), a self-directed care alternative program that allows eligible individuals who need help with activities of daily living or skilled nursing services to choose their caregivers. New York recently finalized regulations to change the reimbursement methodology for fiscal intermediaries and initiated a new Request For Offer (\u201cRFO\u201d) process to competitively procure CDPAP fiscal intermediaries in which we were not selected. These changes could impact our financial performance and ability to continue providing fiscal intermediary services.\nAdditionally, New York has identified significant expenses in excess of its Medicaid budget and exceeded a cap on the state\u2019s Medicaid growth rate that was established by New York statute. In his January 21, 2020, budget address, Governor Cuomo stated his plans to address the Medicaid shortfall with a new Medicaid Redesign Team II (\u201cMRT\u201d), which is tasked with restoring financial sustainability to the state\u2019s Medicaid program, among other objectives. The MRT produced recommendations, a significant portion of which relate to long-term care services, to achieve $1.6 billion in savings for fiscal year 2021, short of its $2.5 billion target. Many of the recommended measures were enacted in the state budget, although some were deferred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The New York Department of Health has proposed regulatory amendments based on the recommendations that would, among other things, limit eligibility for and access to home care services. The implementation of the MRT recommendations could affect our operations and financial performance.\nIn 2020, we derived approximately 37.7% of our net service revenues from services provided in Illinois, 15.1% of our net service revenues in New York (including CDPAP services) and 19.0% of our net service revenues in New Mexico. Because a substantial portion of our business is concentrated in these states, any significant reduction in expenditures that pay for our services or other significant changes in these states may have a disproportionately negative impact on our future operating results. Illinois, in particular, operated without a state budget for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Illinois legislature has enacted comprehensive state budgets for fiscal years 2018 through 2021. However, we cannot predict whether Illinois or other states material to our operating results will timely pass budgets in subsequent years or experience changes or other challenges that negatively impact our ability to be reimbursed for our services in a timely manner.\nThe ACA made significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid policy and funding, among other broad changes across the healthcare industry, promoting a shift toward value-based care, including implementation of alternative payment models. The ACA also resulted in expanded Medicaid eligibility in many states and the establishment of various demonstration projects and Medicaid programs under which states may apply to test new or existing approaches to payment and delivery of Medicaid benefits. CMS has indicated that it will look to states to drive innovation and value through such waivers and has taken steps to update program management, the waiver and state plan amendment approval process, and quality reporting, but the extent and effect of these changes remain uncertain. Future health reform efforts or efforts to repeal or make additional significant changes to the ACA will likely impact both federal and state programs.\nIf changes in Medicare, Medicaid or other state and local medical and social programs result in a reduction in available funds for the services we offer or a reduction in the number of beneficiaries eligible for our services or a reduction in the number of hours or amount of services that beneficiaries eligible for our services may receive, then our revenues and profitability could be negatively impacted. Our profitability depends principally on the levels of government-mandated payment rates and our ability to manage the cost of providing services. In some cases, commercial insurance companies and other private payors rely on government payment systems to determine payment rates. As a result, changes to government healthcare programs that reduce Medicare, Medicaid or other payments may negatively impact payments from private payors, as well. Any reduction in reimbursements or imposition of copayments that dissuade the use of our services, or any reduction in reimbursement from private payors, could also materially adversely affect our profitability.\nFederal and state regulation may impair our ability to consummate acquisitions or open new agencies.\nFederal laws or regulations may adversely impact our ability to acquire home health agencies or open new start-up home health agencies. For example, a Medicare regulation known as the \u201c36 Month Rule\u201d prohibits buyers of Medicare-certified home health agencies from assuming the Medicare billing privileges of an acquired agency if the acquired agency either enrolled in Medicare or underwent a change in majority ownership fewer than 36 months prior to the acquisition, subject to certain exceptions. Instead, the buyer must enroll the acquired home health agencies as new providers with Medicare. The 36 Month Rule can increase competition for acquisition targets that are not subject to the rule and may cause significant Medicare billing delays for the purchases of home health agencies that are subject to the rule. Further, in the past, CMS has limited enrollment of new home health agencies. If another moratorium is imposed on enrollment of new providers in a geographic area we desire to service, our ability to expand operations may be impacted.\nOur ability to expand operations in a state will depend on our ability to obtain a state license to operate, and where required, CON approval. States may limit the number of licenses they issue. The failure to obtain any required CON or license could impair our ability to operate or expand our business.\nThe implementation of alternative payment models and the transition of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries to managed care organizations may limit our market share and could adversely affect our revenues.\nMany government and commercial payors are transitioning providers to alternative payment models that are designed to promote cost-efficiency, quality and coordination of care. For example, accountable care organizations (\u201cACOs\u201d) incentivize hospitals, physician groups, and other providers to organize and coordinate patient care while reducing unnecessary costs. Several states have implemented, or plan to implement, accountable care models for their Medicaid populations. If we are not included in these programs, or if ACOs establish programs that overlap with our services, we are at risk for losing market share and for a loss of our current business.\nWe may be similarly impacted by increased enrollment of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans, resulting in a shift from traditional fee-for-service models. Under the managed Medicare program, also known as Medicare Advantage, the federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide Medicare benefits. Insurers may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher plan costs on beneficiaries. Approximately one-third of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan in 2019, a figure that continues to grow. While hospice services are currently reimbursed as a traditional fee-for-service program under Medicare Part A, hospice services may eventually be offered under Medicare Advantage plans, which could result in reduced reimbursement, limited utilization, and increased competition for managed care contracts.\nEnrollment in managed Medicaid plans is also growing, as states are increasingly relying on managed care organizations to deliver Medicaid program services as a strategy to control costs and manage resources. We may experience increased competition for managed care contracts due to state regulation and limitations. For instance, effective October 2018, New York limited the number of home care providers with which a managed Medicaid long-term care plan can contract. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to be included in plan networks, that we will be able to secure favorable contracts with all or some of the managed care organizations, that our reimbursement under these programs will remain at current levels, that the authorizations for services will remain at current levels or that our profitability will remain at levels consistent with past performance. In addition, operational processes may not be well defined as a state transitions beneficiaries to managed care. For example, membership, new referrals and the related authorization for services to be provided may be delayed, which may result in delays in service delivery to\nconsumers or in payment for services rendered. Difficulties with operational processes may negatively affect our revenue growth rates, cash flow and profitability for services provided.Other alternative payment models may be presented by the government and commercial payors to control costs that subject our Company to financial risk. We cannot predict at this time what effect alternative payment models may have on our Company.\nOur industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market-specific.\nWe compete with personal care service providers, hospice providers, home health providers, private caregivers, larger publicly held companies, privately held companies, privately held single-site agencies, hospital-based agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations and self-directed care programs. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition or a larger number of consumers and payors than we do. In addition, some of these organizations offer more services than we do in the markets in which we operate. These competitive advantages may limit our ability to attract and retain referrals in local markets and to increase our overall market share.\nIn many states, there are limited barriers to entry in providing personal care services. However, some states require entities to obtain a license before providing home care services. Licensure is generally required of agencies providing home health and hospice services, though requirements vary by state. Some states also require a provider to obtain a CON before establishing certain health services, operations or facilities. CON restrictions may reduce the level of competition in a given industry or in a particular geographic region. In addition, economic changes such as increases in minimum wage and changes in Department of Labor rules can also impact the ease of entry into a market. These factors may affect competition in the states in which we operate.\nOften our contracts with payors are not exclusive. Local competitors may develop strategic relationships with referral sources and payors. This could result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of consumers or payors, any of which could harm our business. In addition, existing competitors may offer new or enhanced services that we do not provide, or be viewed by consumers as a more desirable local alternative. The introduction of new and enhanced service offerings, in combination with the development of strategic relationships by our competitors, could cause a decline in revenue, a loss of market acceptance of our services and a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and extensive regulations governing our business, we could be subject to penalties or be required to make changes to our operations, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nThe federal government and the states in which we operate regulate our industry extensively. The laws and regulations governing our operations, along with the terms of participation in various government programs, impose certain requirements on the way in which we do business, the services we offer, and our interactions with providers and consumers. These requirements include matters related to:\n\u2022\nlicensure and certification and enrollment with government programs;\n\u2022\neligibility for services;\n\u2022\nappropriateness and necessity of services provided;\n\u2022\nadequacy and quality of services;\n\u2022\nqualifications and training of personnel;\n\u2022\nconfidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft, security, inoperability and refraining from information blocking, access and exchange of health-related and personal information and medical records;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection, health and safety;\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians, other referral sources and recipients of referrals;\n\u2022\noperating policies and procedures;\n\u2022\naddition of, and changes to, facilities and services;\n\u2022\nadequacy and manner of documentation for services provided;\n\u2022\nbilling and coding for services;\n\u2022\ntimely and proper handling of overpayments; and\n\u2022\ndebt collection and communications with consumers.\nThese laws include, but are not limited to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Stark law, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, other federal and state fraud and abuse, insurance fraud, and fee-splitting laws, which may extend to services reimbursable by any payer, including private insurers, and federal and state laws governing the security and privacy of health information.\nWe currently have contractual relationships with current and potential referral sources and recipients, including hospitals and health systems, skilled nursing facilities and certain physicians who provide medical director and clinical services to our Company. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet applicable regulatory requirements, but we cannot provide assurance that every relationship is fully compliant.\nFederal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts throughout the healthcare industry. While we endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that our practices are fully compliant or that courts or regulatory agencies will not interpret those laws and regulations in ways that will adversely affect our practices. We may also fail to discover instances of noncompliance by businesses we acquire, which could subject us to adverse consequences. The laws and regulations governing our business are subject to change, interpretations may evolve and enforcement focus may shift. These changes could subject us to allegations of impropriety or illegality, require restructuring of relationships with referral sources and recipients or otherwise require changes to our operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could lead to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, the termination of rights to participate in federal and state healthcare programs, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, the suspension or revocation of licenses and nonpayment or delays in our ability to bill and collect for services provided, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial results.\nIn addition, as a result of our participation in Medicaid, Medicare and Veterans Health Administration programs and other state and local governmental programs, and pursuant to certain of our contractual relationships, we are subject to various reviews, compliance audits and investigations by governmental authorities and other third parties to verify our compliance with these programs and agreements as well as applicable laws, regulations and conditions of participation. Each of our home care and hospice agencies must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program. If any of our agencies fail to meet any of the conditions of participation or coverage with respect to state licensure or our participation in Medicaid, Medicare programs, Veterans Health Administration programs and other state and local governmental programs, we may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable surveyor or authority. Failure to implement a plan of action to correct the deficiency within the period provided by the surveyor or authority could result in civil or criminal penalties, damage to our reputation, cancellation of our agreements, suspension or revocation of our licenses, requirements to repay amounts received, disqualification from federal and state healthcare programs, deactivation or revocation of billing privileges, bars on re-enrollment and other negative consequences. These actions may adversely affect our ability to provide certain services, to receive payments from other payors and to continue to operate which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Additionally, we could face liability under the False Claims Act if we submit claims to Medicare or Medicaid while not in compliance with certain conditions of participation. Further, actions taken against one of our offices may subject our other offices to adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern our employment practices, including minimum wage, living wage, and paid time-off requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or changes to these laws and regulations that increase our employment-related expenses, could adversely impact our operations.\nWe are required to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to employment, including occupational safety and health requirements, wage and hour and other compensation requirements, employee benefits, providing leave and sick pay, employment insurance, proper classification of workers as employees or independent contractors, immigration and equal employment opportunity laws. These laws and regulations can vary significantly among jurisdictions and can be highly technical. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of, among other things, changes in federal, state or local laws or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, requiring employers to provide specified benefits or rights to employees, increases in the minimum wage and local living wage ordinances, increases in the level of existing benefits or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. Additionally, the current presidential administration has signaled its support for increases in minimum wage. We may not be able to offset any increased costs and expenses. Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws, including even a seemingly minor infraction, can result in significant penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased some of these risks, with certain states modifying occupational health and safety guidelines in a manner that increases scrutiny and complexity of operations with respect to appropriate training and use in the workplace of PPE and the possibility of corresponding regulatory audit activity with respect to the adequacy of our practices and procedures. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in states modifying standards associated with payment amounts and required justifications to qualify for sick leave and unemployment benefits. These modifications may result in increased operational costs to us.\nSince our operations are concentrated in Illinois, New York and New Mexico, we are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations in these states. The state of Illinois finalized its fiscal year 2020 budget with the inclusion of an appropriation to raise in-home care rates to offset the costs of previous minimum wage increases in Chicago and other areas of the state that were imposed beginning on July 1, 2018. These rates were originally set to be effective July 1, 2019, with in-home care rates to be initially increased by 10.9% to $20.28 from $18.29 to partially offset the costs of the minimum wage hikes. Rates were then further increased on January 1, 2020 by an additional 7.7% to $21.84, providing full funding for both the Chicago minimum wage increases and a statewide raise for all current in-home caregivers. On November 26, 2019, the Chicago City Council voted to approve additional increases in the Chicago minimum wage to $14 per hour beginning July 1, 2020 and to $15 per hour beginning July 1, 2021. The Company and its trade association will be looking for additional funding in the state of Illinois fiscal year 2022 budget to offset the cost of the July 1, 2021 additional minimum wage increases. The state of Illinois finalized its fiscal year 2021 budget, with in-home care rates to be increased by 7.1% to $23.40 from $21.84, effective January 1, 2021, contingent upon federal CMS approval. Although federal CMS approval was obtained by the state, as a result of on-going state revenue declines due to COVID-19 and the failure of the November 2020 referendum to revise the Illinois income tax code, on December 15, 2020, the Governor of Illinois announced a delay in the implementation of the scheduled rate increase to April 1, 2021.\nOur business will benefit from the rate increases noted above, but there is no assurance that additional offsetting rate increases will be adopted in Illinois for fiscal years beyond fiscal year 2021, and our financial performance will be adversely impacted for any periods in which an additional offsetting reimbursement rate increase is not in effect.\nIn addition, certain individuals and entities, known as excluded persons, are prohibited from receiving payment for their services rendered to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal and state healthcare program beneficiaries. If we inadvertently hire or contract with an excluded person, or if any of our current employees or contractors becomes an excluded person in the future without our knowledge, we may be subject to substantial civil penalties, including civil monetary penalties, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and exclusion from the program.\nEach of our subsidiaries that employ an average of at least 50 full-time employees in a calendar year are required to offer a minimum level of health coverage for 95% of our full-time employees in 2020 or be subject to an annual penalty.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by healthcare reform efforts, including repeal of or significant modifications to the ACA.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have considered and passed a large number of laws intended to result in significant changes to the healthcare industry, including the ACA. The ACA affects how healthcare services are delivered and reimbursed through the expansion of public and private health insurance coverage, reduction of growth in Medicare and Medicaid program spending, and the establishment and expansion of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. However, there is significant uncertainty regarding the future of the ACA. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and although the current presidential administration has indicated its intent to protect the ACA, it is possible that there may be continued changes to the ACA, its implementation or its interpretation.\nThere is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing and implementation of alternative provisions, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers as well as other healthcare industry participants. Further, the impact of the outcome of the 2020 federal election on health reform is unknown. Members of Congress have proposed expanding government-funded coverage, including proposals to expand coverage of federally-funded insurance programs as an alternative to private insurance or to establish a single payor system (such reforms are often referred to as \"Medicare for All\"), and some states have pursued or proposed similar measures.\nIn addition, CMS has indicated that it intends to increase flexibility in state Medicaid programs, including by expanding the scope of waivers under which states may implement Medicaid expansion provisions, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. CMS administrators have also signaled interest in changing Medicaid payment models. Other industry participants, such as private payors, may also introduce financial or delivery system reforms. We are unable to predict the nature and success of such initiatives. Healthcare reform initiatives, including changes to or repeal or invalidation of the ACA, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.\nThe trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services is growing among both government and commercial payors. Value-based purchasing programs emphasize quality of outcome and efficiency of care provided, rather than quantity of care provided. For example, Medicare requires hospices and home health agencies to report certain quality data in order to receive full reimbursement. Failure to report quality data or poor performance may negatively impact the amount of reimbursement received. In addition, CMS publishes home health and hospice quality measure data online, through its Care Compare website, to\nallow consumers and others to search and compare data for Medicare-certified providers. Alongside this quality and public reporting effort, CMS currently has a value-based purchasing program affecting home health providers in a number of pilot states, whereby providers receive payment bonuses or penalties based on their achievement of specified performance measures. In January 2021, CMS announced its intent to expand this program. In the future, CMS may establish new value-based purchasing programs affecting a broader range of providers. Other initiatives aimed at improving quality and cost of care include alternative payment models, including ACOs and bundled payment arrangements. It is unclear whether alternative models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease overall reimbursement. Additionally, commercial payors have expressed intent to shift toward value-based reimbursement arrangements.\nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. While we believe we are adapting our business strategies to compete in a value-based reimbursement environment, we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations. If we perform at a level below the outcomes demonstrated by our competitors, fail to satisfy quality data reporting requirements, are unable to meet or exceed quality performance standards under any applicable value-based purchasing program, or otherwise fail to effectively provide or coordinate the efficient delivery of quality healthcare services, our reputation in the industry may be negatively impacted, we may receive reduced reimbursement amounts and we may owe repayments to payors, causing our revenues, financial position, results of operations and cash flows to decline.\nLiability Risks\nOur operations subject us to risk of litigation.\nOperating in the personal care services industry exposes us to an inherent risk of wrongful death, personal injury, professional malpractice and other potential claims or litigation brought by our consumers and employees. From time to time, we are subject to claims alleging that we did not properly treat or care for a consumer that we failed to follow internal or external procedures that resulted in death or harm to a consumer or that our employees mistreated our consumers, resulting in death or harm. We are also subject to claims arising out of accidents involving vehicle collisions brought by consumers whom we are transporting, from employees driving to or from home visits or other affected individuals. We may also be subject to lawsuits from patients, employees and others exposed to COVID-19 at our facilities or in connection with the services provided by our workforce in client residences and third party facilities. Our professional and general liability insurance may not cover all claims against us.\nIn addition, regulatory agencies may initiate administrative proceedings alleging violations of statutes and regulations arising from our services and seek to impose monetary penalties on us. We could be required to pay substantial amounts to respond to regulatory investigations or, if we do not prevail, damages or penalties arising from these legal proceedings. We also are subject to potential lawsuits under the federal False Claims Act or other federal and state whistleblower statutes designed to combat fraud and abuse in our industry. This and other similar lawsuits can involve significant monetary awards or penalties which may not be covered by our insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage and self-insurance coverage reserves are not adequate to cover these claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are successful in our defense, civil lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could distract us from running our business or irreparably damage our reputation.\nOur insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs.\nAlthough we maintain insurance consistent with industry practice, the insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to satisfy all claims made against us. We cannot assure you that claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of our insurance, and any such claims, if successful and in excess of such limits, may have a material adverse effect on our business or assets. We utilize historical data to estimate our reserves for our insurance programs. If losses on asserted claims exceed the current insurance coverage and accrued reserves, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Changes in our annual insurance costs and self-insured retention limits depend in large part on the insurance market, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates, in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms.\nData Security and Privacy Risks\nOur business depends on our information systems. Our operations may be disrupted if we are unable to effectively integrate, manage and maintain the security of our information systems.\nOur business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in, among other things, gathering information to improve the quality of consumer care, optimizing financial performance, adjusting consumer mix, monitoring regulatory compliance and enhancing staff efficiency. We rely on external service providers to provide continual maintenance, upgrading, and enhancement of our primary information systems used for our operational needs. The software we license for our various patient information systems supports intake, personnel scheduling, office clinical and centralized billing and receivables management in an integrated database, enabling us to standardize the care delivered across our network of offices and monitor our performance and consumer\noutcomes. To the extent providers fail to support the software or systems, or if we lose our licenses, our operations could be negatively affected. Our business also depends on a comprehensive payroll and human resources system for basic payroll functions and reporting, payroll tax reporting, managing wage assignments and garnishments. We rely on an external service provider, ADP, to provide continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of our primary human resource and payroll systems. To the extent that ADP fails to support the software or systems, or any of the related support services provided by them, our internal operations could be negatively affected.\nOur business also supports the use of EVV to collect visit submission information through our delivery of home care services. Our solution uses a combination of IVR and GPS enabled smartphones to capture time in and time out, mileage and travel time, as well as the completed care plan tasks. We license this software through CellTrak along with partnering with states who utilize other software. We rely on these providers to provide continual maintenance, enhancements, as well as security of any protected data. To the extent that our EVV vendors fail to support these processes, our internal operations could be negatively affected. Under the 21st Century Cures Act, as amended, states had until January 1, 2020 to establish standards for EVV for Medicaid-funded personal care services. States that failed to meet this deadline could potentially lose, without an application for a good cause extension, an escalating amount of their funding. To the extent that the states fail to properly implement EVV and lose an amount of their funding or to the extent states adopt standards for EVV that are not compatible with our operations, our internal operations could be negatively affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has led to a substantial increase in administrative employees working remotely and, consequently, accessing our system remotely. As a result, we are more dependent on our systems that facilitate remote access and potentially could experience increased risks.\nIf we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, or availability of our information systems, our operations and ability to process transactions and produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain, or expand our systems properly, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems, and increases in administrative expenses.\nWe have full backup of our key information systems. Should our main datacenter become inoperable because of a natural disaster or terrorist acts, our operations would failover to our geographically separate disaster recovery datacenter with a quick return to operations for all sites and systems. All of our sites and branch offices have redundant connections to our primary and backup datacenters using data lines and cellular connections through VPN or MPLS.\nThe key business functions for our main sites also have redundancies with key functions geographically split between our two main facilities, should one not be available due to the above mentioned scenarios.\nWhile we believe these measures are reasonable, no system of information security is able to eliminate the risk of business disruptions.\nA cyber-attack or security breach could cause a loss of confidential consumer data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law and other legal theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nWe rely extensively on computer systems to manage clinical and financial data, to communicate with our consumers, payors, vendors and other third parties, and to summarize and analyze our operating results. We frequently exchange clinical and financial data with third parties in connection with our routine operations and in order to meet our contractual and regulatory obligations. We are required to comply with the federal and state privacy and security laws and requirements, including HIPAA. In spite of our policies, procedures and other security measures used to protect our computer systems and data, occasionally, we have experienced breaches that have required us to notify affected consumers and the government, and we have worked with consumers and the government to resolve such issues. While these past breaches have not had a significant adverse impact on our business or results of operations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to additional and/or more severe cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future. Such attacks or breaches could result in loss of protected patient medical data or other information subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information technology systems or business. In addition, various states, including California, Illinois, Nevada, New York and Massachusetts, have enacted and other states are expected to enact new laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security. To the extent we are subject to such legislation, the potential effects of new legislation are often far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The recently enacted laws often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. In addition, COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on our information technology systems and our ability to securely preserve confidential information, including risks associated with telecommuting issues associated with our employees working remotely. If our privacy and security practices fail to comply with HIPAA and other applicable privacy and security laws and/or if we fail to satisfy applicable breach notification requirements in the event of a security breach, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits and reputational harm. In addition, we may be at increased risk because we outsource certain services or functions to, or have systems that interface with, third parties. Some of these third parties may store or have access\nto our data and may not have effective controls, processes, or practices to protect our information from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. A breach or attack, including those caused by updates and other releases, affecting any of these third parties could harm our business.\nHuman Capital Risks\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or we may incur increased costs in doing so.\nWe must attract and retain qualified non-executive personnel in the markets in which we operate in order to provide our services. We compete for personnel with other providers of social and medical services as well as companies in other service-based industries. Increased competition for trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel. We may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge for our services. An increase in personnel costs could negatively impact our business. In addition, if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our ability to conduct our business operations effectively would be harmed.\nCompetition may be greater for managers, such as regional and agency directors. Our ability to attract and retain personnel depends on several factors, including our ability to provide employees with attractive assignments and competitive benefits and salaries. The loss of one or more of the members of the executive management team or the inability of a new management team to successfully execute our strategies may adversely affect our business. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to provide our services, the quality of our services may decline, and we could lose consumers and referral sources.\nWith the widespread adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality and other labor-intensive industries, we continue to believe we will have an opportunity to increase our hiring of new caregivers in the long term. However, in the near term, the enhanced unemployment benefits offered by several states have suppressed the opportunity to attract this new pool of potential caregivers in these states. For example in September 2020, the state of New York announced the Lost Wages Assistance (\u201cLWA\u201d) program, which provides an additional $300 in weekly benefits to unemployed individuals.\nWe depend on the services of our executive team members.\nOur success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our executive team to manage several of our key functional areas, including operations, business development, accounting, finance, human resources, marketing, information systems, contracting and compliance. The departure of any member of our executive team may materially adversely affect our operations.\nRisk Related to Our Indebtedness\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may adversely affect us.\nOur credit facility contains various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nmake, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any lien;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all our assets;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments, including paying dividends and making certain loans and investments;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, permit to exist, or otherwise become or remain directly or indirectly liable with respect to any additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in any line of additional line of business;\n\u2022\namend our organization documents;\n\u2022\nmake a change in accounting treatment or reporting practices, change our name or change our jurisdiction of organization or formation;\n\u2022\nmake any payment or prepayment of certain subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends and certain other payments from subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in a sale leaseback or similar transaction; and\n\u2022\nmake certain capital expenditures.\nIn addition, our credit facility contains restrictive covenants and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants and financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, all amounts outstanding under our credit facility may become immediately due and payable and all commitments under our credit facility to extend further credit may be terminated. The acceleration of any such indebtedness will result in an event of default under all of our other long-term indebtedness.\nThe potential cessation or modification of LIBOR may increase our interest expense or otherwise adversely affect us.\nA substantial portion of our indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates that use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark rate. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the \u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be assured after 2021, and LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark. Recent proposals for LIBOR reforms may result in the establishment of new methods of calculating LIBOR or the establishment of one or more alternative benchmark rates. Although our credit facility provides for alternative base rates, some of those alternative base rates are related to LIBOR, and the consequences of any potential cessation, modification or other reform of LIBOR cannot be predicted at this time. When LIBOR ceases to exist, we most likely will need to amend the credit facility, and we cannot predict what alternative interest rate(s) will be negotiated with our counterparties. As a result, our interest expense may increase, our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness may be impacted and our available cash flow may be adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nInclement weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, pandemics, riots, civil insurrection or social unrest, looting, protests, strikes or street demonstrations may impact our ability to provide services.\nInclement weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, pandemics, riots, civil insurrection or social unrest, looting, protests, strikes or street demonstrations may prevent our employees from providing authorized services. We are not paid for authorized services that are not delivered due to these events. Furthermore, prolonged disruptions as a result of such events in the markets in which we operate could disrupt our relationships with consumers, patients, caregivers and employees and referral sources located in affected areas and, in the case of our corporate office, our ability to provide administrative support services, including billing and collection services. For example, one of our support centers and a number of our agencies are located in the Midwestern United States, New York and California, increasing our exposure to blizzards and other major snowstorms, ice storms, tornadoes, flooding, wildfires and earthquakes. The impact of disasters and similar events is inherently uncertain. Future inclement weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, pandemics, riots, civil insurrection or social unrest, looting, protests, strikes or street demonstrations may adversely affect our reputation, business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 93073, "SIC": 8082, "TIC": "ADUS"}
