Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section of this report titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and future prospects and, if so, our future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. If any of such events were to happen, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Although we have discussed all known material risks, the risks described below are not the only ones that we may face, and additional risks or uncertainties not known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and future prospects.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following is a summary of the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\n\u25cf The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf The continued evolution of the healthcare industry in the U.S.;\n\u25cf Our inability to continue offering innovative products and services;\n\u25cf The competitive nature of the medication management market;\n\u25cf Our historic significant net losses;\n\u25cf Our failure to effectively manage our future growth;\n\u25cf Our failure to continue grow at the rates we historically have achieved or at all;\n\u25cf Our dependence on product revenue from sales of prescription medications;\n\u25cf Our dependence on revenue from PACE organizations;\n\u25cf Consolidation in the healthcare industry;\n\u25cf Failure by PACE organization clients to meet applicable penetration benchmarks;\n\u25cf Dependence on the growth of our clients;\n\u25cf Our dependence on our ten largest clients and the loss of one or more of our clients;\n\u25cf Our practice of billing our clients and recognizing revenue over the term of the contract;\n\u25cf Our potential inability to attract new clients;\n\u25cf Our inability to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition;\n\u25cf Our failure to produce positive outcomes and cost reductions for our clients;\n\u25cf Our dependence on positive references from existing clients;\n\u25cf The unpredictability of our sales and implementation cycle;\n\u25cf Any failure to offer high-quality client support services;\n\u25cf The failure of our proprietary products and services to operate properly;\n\u25cf Adverse drug events that may arise as result of recommendations made by our services;\n\u25cf Risks associated with sales to clients outside the U.S. or clients with international operations;\n\u25cf Potential exposure to risks associated with international operations;\n\u25cf Our dependence on a group purchasing organization;\n\u25cf The expiration of the EMTM Pilot Program;\n\u25cf Restrictions to license or share data and integrate third-party technologies;\n\u25cf Data loss or corruption due to failures or errors in our systems;\n\u25cf Our inability, or the inability of our third-party vendors, to safeguard the privacy of confidential data;\n\u25cf Our reliance on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, and third parties;\n\u25cf The potential loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees;\n\u25cf The pledging of substantially all of our assets as collateral under our existing line of credit;\n\u25cf The potential lack of additional capital to support business growth;\n\u25cf Adverse impacts due to changes in tax laws;\n\u25cf The potential that we could be subject to additional state and local taxation;\n\u25cf Integration issues and risks associated with past and future acquisitions and investments; and\n\u25cf Other risks associated with integrating acquired businesses, including exposures and losses and limited post-closing recourse.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u25cf Our inability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology and products;\n\u25cf Our inability to adequately protect our trademarks, trade names, and domain names;\n\u25cf The potential that we could incur substantial costs as a result of any infringement claim;\n\u25cf Risks related to our use of open source software;\n\u25cf Risks related to intellectual property lawsuits and litigation; and\n\u25cf Our inability to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information.\nRisks Related to Industry Regulation and Other Legal Compliance Matters\n\u25cf The uncertain and evolving nature of the healthcare regulatory and political framework;\n\u25cf Restrictions imposed by data privacy and security laws, regulations and contractual obligations;\n\u25cf Costs associated with compliance with state and federal statutes and regulations related to the healthcare industry;\n\u25cf Further modifications to the Medicare Part D program and changes in pricing benchmarks; and\n\u25cf Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u25cf The influence of executive officers, directors and principal stockholders over all matters submitted to stockholders for approval;\n\u25cf Provisions of Delaware law that may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us, or merging with us;\n\u25cf Our exclusive forum provision;\n\u25cf The volatility of our common stock;\n\u25cf Our inability to implement effective internal control over financial reporting;\n\u25cf Our historic lack of cash dividends; and\n\u25cf The potential limited ability to use net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d).\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes\n\u25cf Our inability to generate cash flow required to pay our substantial debt;\n\u25cf Our potential to incur substantially more debt;\n\u25cf Our inability to settle conversions of the 2026 Convertible Notes;\n\u25cf The impact of the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Convertible Notes on our financial condition;\n\u25cf The impact of the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash; and\n\u25cf Our entry into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption, which will continue to adversely affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and operations.\nWe continue to experience challenges with revenue growth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020, in our CareVention HealthCare segment, overall census growth for PACE dipped below historical levels. During the second quarter of 2021, we experienced a recovery in our net PACE census growth to pre-pandemic levels, which continued through the remainder of 2021 and positively impacted revenue.\nOur MedWise HealthCare segment also continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes made by CMS to their Medicare Part D Star Ratings improvement programs for health plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted our medication safety services revenues. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has elevated the role of retail pharmacies and created strong demand for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. As a result, we have faced challenges in hiring clinical staff.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs resulting from our efforts to protect the health and well-being of our employees. Our prescription fulfillment pharmacies provide essential services that require employees to continue to work on-site during the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented physical distancing for all employees at our prescription fulfillment pharmacies, provided pharmacy-appropriate protective equipment, instituted additional cleaning protocols, provided additional cleaning materials and encouraged the practice of frequent handwashing. If the procedures we implemented are ineffective or are not followed by our employees, or if we fail to implement additional procedures, as appropriate, our employees and others may experience and transmit illness which has the potential to increase employee turnover, expose us to litigation, and raise our operating costs. We expect to continue to incur additional costs, which may be significant, as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic.\nIn addition, we have instituted work-from-home guidelines for all employees who can work remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business. Further, our management is focused on mitigating the spread of COVID-19, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across our business and could delay other company initiatives.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely impact our ability to purchase or obtain pharmaceutical products which may result in higher supply chain costs and otherwise disrupt our operations. If we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers perceive our response to be inadequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future\ndevelopments that we are not able to predict, including: the severity of the virus; the duration of the pandemic; governmental, business, and other actions (which could include limitations on our operations or mandates to provide products or services); the impacts on our supply chain; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; the health of and the effect on our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs in our prescription fulfillment pharmacies and other critical functions, particularly if members of our work force are quarantined as a result of exposure; any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions; and the potential effects on our internal controls including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that are applicable to our team members and business partners, among others. In addition, if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or impacts our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and to continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nHow quickly, and to what extent, normal economic and operating conditions can resume is difficult to predict, and the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and will depend on future developments, including the widespread availability, use and effectiveness of vaccines, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our clients and their patients, suppliers, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nThe healthcare industry in the U.S. is rapidly evolving, which makes it difficult to forecast demand for our technology-enabled products and services. If we are not successful in promoting the benefits of our products and services, our growth may be limited.\nThe healthcare industry in the U.S. is rapidly evolving. We believe demand for our products and services has been driven in large part by price pressure in traditional fee-for-service healthcare, a regulatory environment that is incentivizing value-based care models, the movement toward patient-centricity and personalized healthcare and advances in technology. Widespread acceptance of the value-based care model is critical to our future growth and success. A reduction in the growth of value-based care or patient-centric models could reduce the demand for our products and services and result in a lower revenue growth rate or decreased revenue.\nIt is uncertain whether the market for technology-enabled healthcare products and services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market adoption. Our future financial performance will depend in part on growth in this market and on our ability to adapt to the emerging demands of our clients. It is difficult to predict the future growth rate and size of our target markets.\nOur success depends to a substantial extent on the willingness of healthcare organizations to increase their use of our technology and our ability to demonstrate the value of our technology to our existing clients and potential clients. If healthcare organizations do not recognize or acknowledge the benefits of our products and services or if we are unable to continue to reduce healthcare costs and drive positive health outcomes, then the market for our products and services might not develop at all, or it might develop more slowly than we expect.\nIf we are unable to offer innovative products and services or our products and services fail to keep pace with our clients\u2019 needs, our clients may terminate or fail to renew their agreements with us and our revenue and results of operations may suffer.\nOur success depends on providing innovative, high-quality products and services that healthcare providers and payers use to improve clinical, financial, and operational performance. If we cannot adapt to rapidly evolving industry standards, technology, and increasingly sophisticated and varied client needs, our existing technology could become undesirable, obsolete, or harm our reputation. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest significant resources in our personnel and technology in a timely and cost-effective manner in order to enhance our existing products and services and introduce new high-quality products and services that existing clients and potential new clients will want. We are continually involved in a number of projects to develop new products and services, including the further expansion and refinement of our proprietary MedWise offerings. If our innovations are not responsive to the\nneeds of our existing clients or potential new clients, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, are not effectively brought to market or significantly increase our operating costs, we may lose existing clients or be unable to obtain new clients and our results of operations may suffer. In addition, the introduction of new solutions by competitors, the emergence of new industry standards, or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could render our existing or future solutions obsolete.\nThe medication management market is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies with greater resources and/or existing business relationships with our current and potential customers.\nThe medication management market is intensely competitive. We expect continued and increased competition from current and future competitors, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. The competitive challenges we face in the medication management market include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf certain competitors may offer or have the ability to offer a broader range of solutions in the marketplace that we are unable to match;\n\u25cf certain competitors may develop alternative solutions to the customer problems our products are designed to solve that may provide a better customer outcome or a lower cost of operation;\n\u25cf certain competitors may develop new features or capabilities for their products not previously offered that could compete directly with our products;\n\u25cf competitive pressures could result in increased price competition for our products and services, fewer customer orders, and reduced gross margins, any of which could harm our business;\n\u25cf current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including larger, more established healthcare supply companies, thereby increasing their ability to develop and offer a broader suite of products and services to address the needs of our prospective customers;\n\u25cf our competitive environment has recently experienced a significant degree of consolidation, which could lead to competitors developing new business models that require us to adapt how we market, sell, or distribute our products;\n\u25cf other established or emerging companies may enter the medication management and supply chain solutions market, or the medication adherence market, with products and services that are preferred by our current and potential customers based on factors such as features, capabilities, or cost;\n\u25cf our competitors may develop, license, or incorporate new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products and services than we do;\n\u25cf certain competitors have greater brand name recognition and a more extensive installed base of medication and supply dispensing systems or other products and services than we do, and such advantages could be used to increase their market share;\n\u25cf certain competitors may have existing business relationships with our current and potential customers, which may cause these customers to purchase medication and supply dispensing systems or automation solutions from these competitors; and\n\u25cf our competitors may secure products and services from suppliers on more favorable terms or secure exclusive arrangements with suppliers or buyers that may impede the sales of our products and services\nWe have incurred significant net losses and we may not be able to generate net income in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $260.3 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development program, and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. Our ability to generate net income is dependent upon, among other things, the acceptance of our products and services by, and the strength of, our existing and potential clients.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe have expanded our operations significantly since our inception. For example, we grew from 29 employees on January 1, 2011, the beginning of our first year of active operations, to 1,602 employees as of December 31, 2021. Our revenue grew from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, to $331.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. If we do not effectively manage our growth as we continue to expand, the quality of our products and services could suffer and our revenue could decline. Our growth to date has increased the significant demands on our management, our operational and financial systems, IT infrastructure, security mechanisms and other resources. In order to successfully expand our business, we must effectively recruit, integrate, and motivate new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, and our business and results of operations could be harmed. We must also continue to improve our existing systems for operational and financial management, including our reporting systems, procedures, and controls. These improvements could require significant capital expenditures and place increasing demands on our management. We may not be successful in managing or expanding our operations or in maintaining adequate financial and operating systems and controls. If we do not successfully manage these processes, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe may not grow at the rates we historically have achieved or at all, even if our key metrics may indicate growth, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have experienced significant growth since 2011. Future revenue may not grow at these same rates or may decline. Our future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our revenue from existing clients, to complete sales to new clients, and to expand our client base in the healthcare industry and with provider and payer organizations. We may not be successful in executing on our growth strategies and may not continue to grow our revenue at similar rates as we have in the past. Our ability to execute on our existing sales pipeline, create additional sales pipelines, and expand our client base depends on the attractiveness of our products and services relative to those offered by our competitors, our ability to demonstrate the value of our existing and future products and services, and our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing personnel. In addition, clients in some market segments in which we have a more limited presence may be slower to adopt our products and services than we currently anticipate. Our ability to maintain future revenue growth may also impact assumptions utilized in our assessments over the fair value of our assets, including our goodwill and intangible assets, and a decline in revenue growth could result in potential impairment charges to these assets.\nTo date, we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of prescription medications, and revenue from sales of prescription medications is dependent upon factors outside of our control.\nTo date, substantially all of our product revenue has been derived from sales of prescription medications and related services, and for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive the substantial majority of our product revenue from sales of prescription medications and related services. Revenue from prescription medication fulfillment is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as growth or contraction in the patient populations of our clients and the number and mix of medications each patient is prescribed. Any change in these factors could harm our financial results.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from PACE organizations. Any changes in laws or regulations, or any other factors that cause a decline in the use of PACE organizations to provide healthcare could hurt our ability to generate revenue and grow our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from PACE organizations, which are our largest clients and account for 72% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. PACE organizations reflect a relatively new,\nvalue-based model for providing healthcare to the elderly and are funded by both Medicare and Medicaid. Our ability to generate revenue and grow our business may be compromised if the laws and regulations that currently promote PACE organizations were to change in a way that makes operating a PACE organization less attractive, if other Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement models are developed that are more attractive to the healthcare providers that operate PACE organizations, or if the prevalence of PACE organizations were to decline for any other reason.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to the elimination of some of our clients and make others larger, which could decrease demand for our solutions or create pricing pressure.\nMany healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems. If regulatory and economic conditions continue to facilitate additional consolidation in the healthcare industry, some of our current clients, and possibly our future clients, may be eliminated. Such market fluctuations may result in decreased need for some or all of our products and services as some of our clients disappear, and others acquire larger market power, which may be used to develop various solutions in-house, rather than purchasing them from us, or negotiate fee reductions for our products and services.\nFailure by PACE organization clients to meet applicable penetration benchmarks could result in loss of their service area, which could lead to our loss of that business and a corresponding decline in our revenue.\nPACE organizations in many states are subject to penetration benchmarks regarding the number of eligible lives in their service areas that have been captured by the program. If the number of members covered by any of our PACE organization clients were to be reduced by a material amount, such decrease may lead to a loss of their service area, which could result in our loss of the client and a corresponding decline in our revenue.\nThe growth of our business relies, in part, on the growth of our clients, which is difficult to predict and is affected by factors outside of our control.\nWe enter into agreements with our clients under which a portion of our fees are dependent upon the number of members that are covered by our clients\u2019 programs each month. The number of members covered by a client\u2019s program is often affected by factors outside of our control, such as the client\u2019s pricing, overall quality of service and member retention initiatives. If the number of members covered by one or more of our client\u2019s programs were to be reduced, such decrease would lead to a decrease in our revenue. In addition, the growth forecasts of our clients are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which our clients compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasted, their program membership could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nA few clients account for a significant portion of our revenue and, as a result, the loss of one or more of these clients could hurt our revenue.\nOur ten largest clients accounted for 41%, 43%, and 53% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our engagement with our ten largest clients is generally covered through contracts that are multi-year in their duration. One or more of these clients may decline to renew their existing contracts with us upon expiration and any such failure to renew could have a negative impact on our revenue and compromise our growth strategy. Further, if one or more of these clients significantly decreases its use of our solutions, we would lose revenue and our growth would be compromised. We believe our clients view us as a trusted partner that shares their commitment to improving medication-related health outcomes and reducing overall healthcare costs.\nBecause we generally bill our clients and recognize revenue over the term of the contract, near-term declines in new or renewed agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nMost of our revenue in each quarter is derived from agreements entered into with our clients during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed agreements in any one quarter may not be fully reflected in our revenue for that quarter because, although we enter into multi-year arrangements with our clients and recognize revenue over the term of the contract, such revenue varies based on the volume and pricing of prescriptions filled and the number of members of the healthcare organization and is, thus, not recognized evenly. Such declines, however, would negatively affect our revenue in future periods. The effect of any significant downturns in sales of, and market demand for, our products and services, as well as any potential changes in our rate of renewals or renewal terms, may not be fully\nreflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure rapidly, or at all, to take account of reduced revenue.\nIf we do not continue to attract new clients, we may not be able to grow our business.\nIn order to grow our business, we must continually attract new clients. Our ability to do so depends in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts. Potential clients may seek out other options. Therefore, we must demonstrate that our products and services provide a viable solution for potential clients. If we fail to provide high-quality solutions and convince individual clients of our value proposition, we may not be able to attract new clients. Our financial results could be harmed if the market for our products and services declines or grows more slowly than we expect, or if the number of individual clients that use our solutions declines or fails to increase as we expect.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business will be harmed.\nMaintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand recognition is critical to our relationships with existing clients and to our ability to attract new clients. The promotion of our brand may require us to make substantial investments. As our market becomes increasingly competitive, we anticipate that these marketing initiatives may become more difficult and expensive. Our marketing activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue, and to the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur. In addition, any factor that diminishes our reputation or that of our management, including failing to meet the expectations of our clients, could make it substantially more difficult for us to attract new clients. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business may not grow and we could lose our relationships with clients.\nPositive outcomes and cost reductions for our clients are not necessarily predictive of future outcomes or costs.\nAlthough several of our clients have reported improved outcomes for their patients and cost reductions as a result of our services, these results are not necessarily predictive of future outcomes. Other factors, including changes in healthcare regulations or other business practices or our clients\u2019 implementation of other cost saving measures may have contributed to positive outcomes or reduced costs. Moreover, outcome and cost reduction data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their technologies and services were effective initially were unable to maintain positive results over time. If we fail to produce positive outcomes and reduce costs for our clients, they may not continue to use our services and we may be unable to attract new clients. Each of these factors could harm our business.\nOur marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to receive positive references from our existing clients.\nOur marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to call on our current clients to provide positive references to new, potential clients. The loss or dissatisfaction of any client could substantially harm our brand and reputation, inhibit the market adoption of our products and services, impair our ability to attract new clients and maintain existing clients and, ultimately, harm our financial results.\nOur sales and implementation cycle can be long and unpredictable and can require considerable time and expense, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nThe sales cycle for our products and services, from initial sales activity with a potential client to contract execution and implementation can be long and varies widely by client, typically ranging from three to twelve months. Some of our clients undertake pilot programs for our products and services which range generally from six to eighteen months in length. These pilot programs may result in extended sales cycles and upfront sales costs as the potential client evaluates our products and services. Our sales efforts involve educating our clients about the use, technical capabilities, and benefits of our products and services. It is possible that in the future we may experience even longer sales cycles, more complex client requirements, higher upfront sales costs, and less predictability in completing some of our sales, as we continue to expand into new territories and add additional products and services. If our sales cycle lengthens or our substantial upfront sales and implementation investments do not result in sufficient sales to justify our investments, our operating results may be harmed.\nAny failure to offer high-quality client support services may adversely affect our relationships with our clients and harm our financial results.\nOur clients depend on our technical support to resolve any issues relating to our offering and technology solutions and to provide initial and ongoing training and education when necessary. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the quality of our offering, our business reputation, and strong recommendations from our existing clients. Any failure to maintain high-quality and highly responsive technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality and highly-responsive support, could harm our reputation and compromise our ability to sell our solutions to existing and prospective clients.\nWe offer client support services with our offerings and may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in client demand for support services, particularly as we increase the size of our client base. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. It is difficult to predict client demand for our support services. If client demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our clients. Additionally, increased client demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and hurt our ability to achieve profitability.\nOur proprietary products and services may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to a variety of claims against us or divert our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nTechnology-enabled product and service development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex and may involve unforeseen difficulties. We may encounter technical obstacles, and we may discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary products and services from operating properly. If our products and services do not function reliably or fail to achieve client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us and attempt to cancel their contracts with us. Moreover, material performance problems, defects, or errors in our existing or new products and services may arise in the future and may result from, among other things, the lack of interoperability of our software with systems and data that we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control or undetected in our testing. Defects or errors in our products or services might discourage existing or potential clients from purchasing services from us. Correction of defects or errors could prove to be time consuming, costly, impossible or impracticable. The existence of errors or defects in our products and services and the correction of such errors could divert our resources from other matters relating to our business, damage our reputation, and increase our costs.\nAdverse drug events resulting from optimizing a patient\u2019s medication regimen through recommendations made by our services or our pharmacists could give rise to claims against us and could damage our reputation.\nWe provide medication risk management services that includes answering prescriber questions and making recommendations to prescribers and providing formal consultations with physicians and patients. In the event that optimizing a patient\u2019s medication regimen through recommendations made by our services or our pharmacists contributes to an ADE, clients and patients could assert liability claims against us, which may not be subject to a contractually agreed upon liability cap, and clients could attempt to cancel their contracts with us. Such instances may also generate significant negative publicity that could harm our reputation, increase our costs and materially affect our results of operations.\nFuture sales to clients outside the U.S. or clients with international operations might expose us to risks inherent in international markets, which could hurt our business.\nAn element of our growth strategy is to further expand internationally. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the U.S. In January 2019, we completed our acquisition of DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd (\u201cDoseMe\u201d), which is based in Brisbane, Australia. Because of our limited experience with international operations, our current and any potential future international expansion efforts might not be successful in creating demand for our\nproducts and services outside of the U.S. or in effectively selling our products and services in the international markets we enter. In addition, we will face risks in doing business internationally that could hurt our business, including:\n\u25cf the need to localize and adapt our products and services for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing, supporting, and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf different pricing environments, longer sales cycles, and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u25cf new and different sources of competition;\n\u25cf international political and economic conditions;\n\u25cf weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the U.S. and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the U.S.;\n\u25cf laws and business practices favoring local competitors, including trade protection measures;\n\u25cf compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, anti-bribery, foreign investment, tax, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u25cf increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u25cf adverse tax consequences; and\n\u25cf if we denominate our international contracts in local currencies, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies might negatively affect our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our results of operations. In the event that we are unable to manage the complications associated with international operations, our business prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Any further expansion in our international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required for establishing and expanding our international operations will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability. If we invest substantial time and resources to establish and expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results may suffer.\nIf we expand our international operations, we will increasingly face political, legal and compliance, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that we do not face or that are more significant than those in our domestic operations. Our exposure to these risks is expected to increase.\nIf we expand our international operations, we will increasingly face political, legal and compliance, operational, regulatory, economic, and other risks that we do not face or that are more significant than those in our domestic operations. These risks vary widely by country and include varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands, government intervention and censorship, discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets, and pricing constraints. Our international products need to meet country-specific client preferences as well as country-specific legal requirements, including those related to licensing, privacy, data storage, location, protection, and security.\nOur international operations increase our exposure to and require us to devote significant management resources to implement controls and systems to comply with the privacy and data protection laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions; to comply with the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws of the U.S. (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977); and to comply with similar laws in other jurisdictions. Implementing our compliance policies, internal controls, and other systems upon our expansion into new countries and geographies may require the investment of considerable time and management, as well as financial, and other resources over a number of\nyears before any significant revenues or profits are generated. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees; restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and significant brand and reputational harm. We must regularly reassess the size, capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes, and we must have effective change management processes and internal controls in place to address changes in our business and operations. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial position, brand, reputation, and/or long-term growth.\nOur international operations require us to overcome logistical and other challenges based on differing languages, cultures, legal and regulatory schemes, and time zones. Our international operations encounter labor laws, customs and employee relationships that can be difficult, less flexible than in our domestic operations and expensive to modify or terminate. In some countries we may be required to, or choose to, operate with local business partners, which would require us to manage our partner relationships and may reduce our operational flexibility and ability to quickly respond to business challenges.\nWe purchase a significant portion of our pharmaceutical products from a group purchasing organization which receives discounts from a primary supplier.\nOn June 30, 2020, we entered into an Affiliated Pharmacy Agreement and Pharmaceutical Program Supply Agreement, including an associated High Volume Retailer Addendum, or the Pharmaceutical Supply Agreements, with Thrifty Drug Stores, Inc, or Thrifty Drug. Pursuant to the terms of the Pharmaceutical Supply Agreements, which have a term lasting through September 30, 2023, subject to renewal under certain circumstances, we agree to purchase not less than 98% of our total prescription product requirements from Thrifty Drug. The Pharmaceutical Supply Agreements can be terminated solely by Thrifty Drug for, among other things, a payment default that continues for ten days after notice thereof and our failure to maintain credit worthiness. If we are no longer able to purchase our pharmaceutical products from a group purchasing organization, there can be no assurance that our operations would not be disrupted or that we could obtain the necessary pharmaceutical products at similar cost or at all. In this event, failure to satisfy our clients\u2019 requirements would result in defaults under client contracts subjecting us to damages and the potential termination of those contracts.\nAs of January 1, 2022, we ceased recognizing revenue related to the EMTM Pilot Program, which expired on December 31, 2021.\nOn January 1, 2017, we launched the Enhanced Medication Therapy Management program, with a large, regional Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan participating in the CMMI Medicaid Part D pilot. On September 16, 2021, we issued a press release highlighting a peer-reviewed three-part series published in the September issue of The American Journal of Managed Care outlining the results of the EMTM Pilot Program. In particular, the third study revealed annual overall cost savings of 7.5% per beneficiary from 2018 to 2019 for beneficiaries who received an MSR using MedWise compared to those that were identified as high risk but did not receive an MSR. We believe that these peer-reviewed results and the experience we gained over the lifespan of the EMTM Pilot Program will continue to differentiate our MedWise solutions in the market and support future growth with a wide range of health plans and at-risk provider groups.\nHowever, CMMI did not extend the EMTM Pilot Program, and it expired on December 31, 2021. Accordingly, beginning on January 1, 2022, we ceased recognizing revenue related to the EMTM Pilot Program. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the EMTM Pilot Program revenue accounted for 3% and 4%, respectively, of our total revenue. While historically revenue related to the EMTM Pilot Program has not accounted for a material percentage of our total revenue, the expiration of the EMTM Pilot Program could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe do not believe that the decision by CMMI to not extend the EMTM Pilot Program is a reflection of the financial savings or improved quality of care we have delivered and recently documented in CMMI\u2019s August 2021 report, but is based on the EMTM Pilot Program as a whole, which covered six distinct regions across the country, 1.9 million Part D beneficiaries during 2019, and multiple vendors testing new types of member targeting, outreach, and clinical interventions.\nAny restrictions on our ability to license or share data and integrate third-party technologies could harm our business.\nWe depend upon licenses from third parties for some of the technology and data used in our products and services, and for some of the technology platforms upon which these products and services are built and operate. Most of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive and our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses to compete directly with us. We also license some of our technology and share data we collect with our clients, including under agreements with health systems and providers of electronic health records. We expect that we will need to obtain additional licenses from third parties in the future in connection with the development of our products and services. In addition, we obtain a portion of the data that we use from public records and from our clients for specific client engagements. Our licenses for information may not be sufficient to allow us to use the data that is incorporated into our products and services for all potential or contemplated applications and products.\nIn the future, data providers could withdraw their data from us or restrict our usage for any reason, including if there is a competitive reason to do so, if legislation is passed restricting the use of the data or if judicial interpretations are issued restricting use of the data that we currently use in our products and services. In addition, data providers could fail to adhere to our quality control standards in the future, causing us to incur additional expense to appropriately utilize the data. If a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw or restrict their data, or if they fail to adhere to our quality control standards, and if we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and integrate these data sources into our service offerings, our ability to provide products and services to our clients would be compromised and our future growth and success could be delayed or limited.\nWe also integrate into our proprietary applications and use third-party software to maintain and enhance, among other things, content generation and delivery, and to support our technology infrastructure. Some of this software is proprietary and some is open source software. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology, and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. These technologies may not be available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could be difficult to replace once integrated into our own proprietary applications. Most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. Our inability to obtain, maintain or comply with any of these licenses could delay development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed, and integrated, which could delay or limit our future growth.\nData loss or corruption due to failures or errors in our systems may expose us to liability, hurt our reputation and relationships with existing clients, and force us to incur significant costs.\nHardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant. Complex software such as ours may contain errors or failures that are not detected until after the software is introduced or updates and new versions are released. We continually introduce new software and updates and enhancements to our existing software. Despite testing by us, we may discover defects or errors in our software. Any defects or errors could expose us to risk of liability to clients and the government and could cause delays in the introduction of new products and services, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design modifications, decrease market acceptance or client satisfaction with our products and services, or cause harm to our reputation. Data losses related to personal health records could result in additional risks. We are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations and contractual obligations governing the transmission, security, and privacy of health and other sensitive or proprietary information, which may impose restrictions on the manner in which we access, store, transmit, use, and disclose such information and subject us to penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws or contractual provisions.\nFurthermore, our clients might use our software together with products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts, hurt our reputation, and lead to significant client relations problems.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and other risks associated with data security breaches. If we are unable to safeguard the security and privacy of confidential data, we may incur increased expenses to mitigate our disclosure or address any such incidents, and our reputation and business will be harmed.\nOur products and services involve the collection, storage and analysis of confidential or proprietary information, and we are subject to numerous laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. (both federal and state) to protect both individual identifiable information as well as personal health information. If a cyber-incident, such as a phishing or ransomware attack, virus, malware installation, server malfunction, software or hardware failure, impairment of data integrity, loss of data or other computer assets, adware, or other similar issue, impairs or shuts down one or more of our computing systems or our IT network, we may be subject to negative treatment and lawsuits by our clients. In addition, attention to remediating cyber incidents may distract our technical or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Public announcements of such cyber incidents could occur and negative perception of such cyber incidents could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and we could lose sales and clients.\nIn certain cases, confidential or proprietary information is provided to third parties, such as the service providers that host our technology platform, and we may be unable to control the use of our information or the security protections used by third parties. Cyber incidents and malicious internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and providers of hosting and cloud-based services are often targeted. If the third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws, contracts or our security policies, these violations could also put our confidential or proprietary information at risk and otherwise hurt our business. In addition, if the security measures of our clients are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems, we may face negative publicity or reputational harm if our clients or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such security breaches to us or our systems. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breaches by us or by our third-party service providers that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information, employee error or malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities that may result in a defeat of our or our third-party providers\u2019 security measures.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security incidents caused by known cyber vulnerabilities or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. We, our customers, and our third-party service providers face an evolving threat landscape in which cybercriminals, among others, employ a complex array of cyber-attack techniques designed to access sensitive information or disrupt our operations, including, for example, the use of fraudulent or stolen access credentials, malware, ransomware, phishing, denial of service, and other types of attacks. These types of cyber-attacks are becoming more prevalent, particularly in the healthcare industry, have occurred in our systems in the past, and may occur in our systems in the future. While cyber-attacks have not, to date, had a material impact on our operations, there is no assurance that such impacts will be immaterial in the future. Moreover, despite our implementation of security measures, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information or to sabotage information technology systems change frequently, are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Furthermore, unknown cyber vulnerabilities caused by third-party software or services may exist within our system. As a result, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate such techniques or vulnerabilities or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any compromise or perceived compromise of our security could damage our reputation and our relationship with our clients, reduce demand for our products and services and subject us to significant liability or regulatory actions. In addition, in the event that new privacy or data security laws are implemented, we may not be able to timely comply with such requirements, or such requirements may not be compatible with our current processes. Changing our processes could be time-consuming and expensive, and failure to timely implement required changes could subject us to liability for non-compliance. We may also incur significant remediation costs, including liability for stolen customer or employee information, repairing system damage, or providing benefits to affected customers or employees.\nWe rely on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, other third parties, and our own systems to provide services to our clients, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and hurt our reputation and relationships with clients.\nOur ability to deliver our products and services, particularly our cloud-based solutions, is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet and other telecommunications services by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network connection with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable internet access and services and reliable telephone and facsimile services. Our services are designed to operate without perceptible interruption in accordance with our service level commitments.\nWe have, however, experienced limited interruptions in these systems in the past, including server failures that temporarily slowed down the performance of our services, and we may experience similar or more significant interruptions in the future. We rely on internal systems as well as third-party suppliers, including bandwidth and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our services. We do not currently maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. Interruptions in these systems or services, whether due to system failures, cyber incidents, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events, could affect the security or availability of our services and prevent or inhibit the ability of our clients and their patients to access our services. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could result in substantial costs to remedy those problems or harm our relationship with our clients and our business.\nAdditionally, any disruption in the network access, telecommunications or co-location services provided by third-party providers or any failure of or by third-party providers\u2019 systems or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business. We exercise limited control over our third-party suppliers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide. Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could hurt our relationships with clients and expose us to third-party liabilities. Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. In addition, we might not continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.\nThe reliability and performance of our internet connection may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents. The services of other companies delivered through the internet have experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of the internet\u2019s infrastructure, and such outages and delays could affect our systems and services in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the availability of the internet to us for delivery of our internet-based services.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to host and maintain our technology platform.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to host and maintain our technology platform, including our EireneRx and MedWise software. Our ability to offer our products and services and operate our business is dependent on maintaining our relationships with third-party vendors, particularly Amazon Web Services, and entering into new relationships to meet the changing needs of our business. Any deterioration in our relationships with such vendors or our failure to enter into agreements with vendors in the future could harm our business and our ability to pursue our growth strategy. Because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that, despite precautions taken at our vendors\u2019 facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, cyber incident, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. These service interruptions could cause our platform to be unavailable to our clients and impair our ability to deliver products and services and to manage our relationships with new and existing clients.\nIf our vendors are unable or unwilling to provide the services necessary to support our business, or if our agreements with such vendors are terminated, our operations could be significantly disrupted. Some of our vendor agreements may be unilaterally terminated by the licensor for convenience, and if such agreements are terminated, we may not be able to enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all. We may also incur substantial costs, delays and disruptions to our business in transitioning such services to ourselves or other third-party vendors. In addition, third-party vendors may not be able to provide the services required in order to meet the changing needs of our business.\nWe depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy and grow our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for our executive officers, other than for our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Calvin H. Knowlton, or any of our other key employees. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. We are highly dependent on Dr. Calvin H. Knowlton, Dr. Orsula Knowlton, our co-President, and Mr. Brian W. Adams, our Co-President and Chief Financial Officer. All of our employees' employment is at-will, including the employment of Drs. Calvin and Orsula\nKnowlton and Mr. Brian Adams, which means that any of these employees could leave our employment at any time. The replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees would likely involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nIn addition, competition for qualified management in our industry is intense. Many of the companies with which we compete for management personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do. As a result, we may experience difficulty hiring and retaining qualified personnel. The departure of key personnel could also hurt our business. In such event, we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our business, and we might not be able to employ a suitable replacement for the departing individual, or a replacement might not be willing to work for us on terms that are favorable to us.\nIn addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the technology industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity instruments they are to receive in connection with their employment. Volatility in the price of our common stock might, therefore, compromise our ability to attract or retain highly skilled personnel. Furthermore, the requirement to expense stock options and other equity instruments might discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option or equity awards that job candidates require to join our company. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.\nSubstantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral under our existing line of credit.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total indebtedness was $348.8 million, which includes amounts outstanding on the convertible senior subordinated notes and credit facility. Our current credit facility provides for borrowings, on a revolving basis, in an aggregate amount up to $120.0 million to be used for general corporate purposes. The credit facility is secured by all of our personal property, whether presently existing or created or acquired in the future, as well as our intellectual property. If we are unable to repay any secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to the indebtedness and may sell the assets pledged as collateral in order to repay those borrowings. As of December 31, 2021, $29.5 million in borrowings were outstanding under our credit facility.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur operations have required a significant investment of cash since inception. We intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth, respond to business challenges or opportunities, develop new applications and services, enhance our existing platform and services, hire additional sales and marketing personnel, enhance our operating infrastructure, and potentially acquire complementary businesses and technologies. As of December 31, 2021, we had $9.7 million of unrestricted cash.\nOur future capital requirements may be significantly different from our current estimates and will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, renewal activity, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. Accordingly, we might need to engage in equity or debt financings or collaborative arrangements to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which might make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We might have to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or offerings that we otherwise would not consider. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be limited.\nOur effective tax rate may increase or decrease, and we may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to audit by tax authorities where we do business. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings and the realizability of deferred tax assets. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, at any time, U.S. federal tax laws or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be changed. In December 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which made widespread changes to the Internal Revenue Code, was signed into law; while we believe that this law generally will have a favorable effect on corporations and their stockholders, uncertainty remains regarding the full effect that this law will have on us and our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders. We also cannot predict whether, when or to what extent other new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations, or rulings will be issued. As a result, changes in U.S. federal tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and adversely impact our stockholders.\nOccasionally, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted that may result in an increase in our tax liability. Shortfalls in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income.\nCertain U.S. state tax authorities may assert that we have a state nexus and seek to impose state and local income taxes which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are currently licensed to operate in all fifty states and file state income tax returns in 41 states. There is a risk that certain state tax authorities where we do not currently file a state income tax return could assert that we are liable for state and local income taxes based upon income or gross receipts allocable to such states. States are becoming increasingly aggressive in asserting a nexus for state income tax purposes. We could be subject to state and local taxation, including penalties and interest attributable to prior periods, if a state tax authority successfully asserts that our activities give rise to a nexus. Such tax assessments, penalties, and interest may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur past and future acquisitions and investments may be difficult to integrate, divert management resources, result in unanticipated costs, or dilute our stockholders.\nPart of our business strategy is to acquire or invest in companies, products, or technologies that complement our current products and services, enhance our market coverage or technical capabilities, or offer growth opportunities. For example, we completed our acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify in 2018, DoseMe and PrescribeWellness in 2019, and Personica in 2020. Our past and future acquisitions and investments could pose numerous risks to our operations, including:\n\u25cf difficulty integrating the purchased operations, products, or technologies;\n\u25cf delays with the delivery of our services or the quality of those services, as a result of the integration, which could in turn cause us to lose customers, reducing our revenues and earnings;\n\u25cf substantial unanticipated integration costs;\n\u25cf assimilation of the acquired businesses, which may divert significant management attention and financial resources from our other operations and could disrupt our ongoing business;\n\u25cf failure to successfully integrate the duties, responsibility, and other factors of interest to management and employees of acquired businesses, could result in loss of employees to our competitors, which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business;\n\u25cf difficulty retaining or developing the acquired business\u2019s clients;\n\u25cf adverse effects on our existing business relationships;\n\u25cf failure to implement and retain uniform standards, controls, policies, procedures, and information systems;\n\u25cf failure to realize the potential cost savings or other financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions, including failure to consummate any proposed or contemplated transaction; and\n\u25cf liabilities from the acquired businesses for infringement of intellectual property rights, loss of intellectual property or goodwill through inadequate data security measures, unknown cyber vulnerabilities or network intrusions, or other claims and failure to obtain indemnification for such liabilities or claims.\nIn connection with these acquisitions or investments, we could incur debt, amortization expenses related to intangible assets or large write-offs, assume liabilities, or issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 ownership. Additionally, our past and future acquisitions could cause stock volatility due to investors\u2019 uncertainty regarding the value of the acquired businesses, divert capital from other uses, or result in adverse outcomes of litigation matters or other contingent liabilities assumed in or arising out of an acquisition.\nWe may be unable to complete acquisitions or integrate the operations, products, or personnel gained through any such acquisition successfully or without adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNotwithstanding the due diligence investigation we performed, or may perform, in connection with any acquisition, the acquired businesses may have liabilities, losses, or other exposures for which we do not have adequate insurance coverage, indemnification, or other protection.\nWhile we performed, or currently intend to perform, significant due diligence on each acquired business prior to consummating its acquisition, we are dependent on the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the acquired businesses and their representatives when conducting due diligence and evaluating the results of such due diligence. We did not, and will not, control and may be unaware of activities of an acquired business before its acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, information security vulnerabilities, violations of laws, policies, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\nOur post-closing recourse with respect to an acquisition may be limited under the relevant merger or purchase agreement.\nThe obligation of the relevant sellers to indemnify us with respect to an acquisition may be limited to, among others, breaches of specified representations and warranties and covenants included in the applicable merger or purchase agreement. Except in the event the sellers or the acquired business breaches certain, limited fundamental representations or with respect to fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or willful misconduct, we are often unable to make a claim for indemnification with respect to representations and warranties unless and until the indemnifiable losses exceed an amount specified in each merger or purchase agreement. We may also be limited in our ability to make a claim for a breach of a non-fundamental representation after a certain date following the closing of the relevant acquisition. We have obtained representation and warranty insurance policies in connection with past acquisitions and may seek to obtain similar policies in the future. Our ability to make a claim under any such policy for a breach of a representation will also likely be limited after a certain date following the closing of the relevant acquisition. If any issues arise post-closing, we may not be entitled to sufficient, or any, indemnification or recourse from the sellers or our representation and warranty insurance policy, if available, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain, and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology and products or if the scope of our intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, others may be able to develop and commercialize technology and products substantially similar to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be compromised.\nOur business depends on proprietary technology and content, including software, databases, confidential information, and know-how, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade-secret and copyright laws, confidentiality procedures, cyber security practices, and contractual provisions to protect the intellectual property rights of our proprietary technology and content. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional trademark, patent, and other intellectual property filings, which could be expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to obtain protection for our technology and even if we are successful in attaining effective patent, trademark, trade-secret, and copyright protection, it is expensive to maintain these rights and the costs of defending our rights could be substantial. Furthermore, recent changes to U.S. intellectual property laws may jeopardize the enforceability and validity of our intellectual property portfolio and harm our ability to obtain patent protection of some of our unique business methods.\nIn addition, these measures may not be sufficient to offer us meaningful protection or provide us with any competitive advantages. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our competitive position and our business could be harmed, as third parties may be able to commercialize and use technologies and software products that are substantially the same as ours without incurring the development and licensing costs that we have incurred. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated, our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third parties, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide us with competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of some of our offerings, or other competitive harm.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we seek to analyze our competitors' products and services, and may in the future seek to enforce our rights against potential infringement. However, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to enforce our rights as against infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Any inability to meaningfully protect our intellectual property rights could harm our ability to compete and reduce demand for our products and services. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could hurt our market position and business opportunities. Also, some of our products and services rely on technologies, data and software developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any third-party technologies, data or software could result in delays in implementing or provisioning our products and services until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our business.\nWe may also be required to protect our proprietary technology and content in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful, or which we may not pursue in every location. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country, and the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the U.S. and elsewhere, and from interpretations of intellectual property laws by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, we may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights necessary to provide us with a competitive advantage. Our failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected and if we cannot protect our domain names, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our competitive position may be harmed.\nThe registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names that we own may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic, lapsed, or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build name recognition with potential clients. In addition, third parties may in the future file for registration of trademarks similar or identical to our trademarks. If they succeed in registering or developing common law rights in such trademarks, and if we are not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to develop brand recognition of our technologies, products, or services. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe also currently own the web domain names www.tabularasahealthcare.com, www.trhc.com, www.carekinesis.com, www.careventions.com, www.careventionhc.com, www.medliance.com, www.capstoneperformancesystems.com, www.eirenerx.com, www.medwisehealthcare.com, www.medwise.com, www.medwiseadvisor.com, www.niarx.com, www.sinfoniarx.com, www.mediture.com, www.cognify.com, and www.doseme-rx.com, each of which is critical to the operation of our business. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names is generally regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. The regulation of domain names in the U.S. and in foreign countries is subject to change. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names in all countries in which we conduct business. Furthermore, it is unclear whether laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights will be extended to protect domain names. Therefore, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy of establishing a strong brand if we cannot prevent others from using similar domain names or trademarks. This failure could impair our ability to increase our market share and revenue.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party's intellectual property rights.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to develop and commercialize our products and services without infringing or being claimed to have infringed the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property disputes can be costly to defend and may cause our business, operating results, and financial condition to suffer. As the market for technology-enabled healthcare solutions in the United States expands and intellectual property protections asserted by others increase, the risk increases that there may be intellectual property asserted by others and patents issued to third parties that relate to our products and technology of which we are not aware or that we must challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated. Whether merited or not, we may face allegations that we, our clients, our licensees, or parties indemnified by us have infringed or otherwise violated the patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, we have received letters from third parties from time to time claiming that our software, technologies, or methodologies are covered by their patents or that our activities are otherwise violating their patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights, and future claims may require us to expend time and money to address and resolve these claims. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from other technology-reliant companies.\nWe may also face allegations that our employees or consultants have misappropriated the intellectual property or proprietary rights of their former employers or other third parties, as the case may be. It may be necessary for us to initiate litigation to defend ourselves in order to determine the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or to establish our respective rights. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have merit, such claims can be time-consuming, divert management's attention and financial resources, and can be costly to evaluate and defend. Results of any such litigation are difficult to predict and may require us to stop commercializing or using our products or technology, obtain licenses, modify our products and technology while we develop non-infringing substitutes, incur substantial damages or settlement costs, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or providing the affected products and services. If we require a third-party license, it may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, and we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees, or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products\nand services. We may also have to redesign our products or services so they do not infringe third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time, during which our technology and products may not be available for commercialization or use. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not obtain a third-party license to the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or obtain similar technology from another source, our ability to operate our business could be compromised.\nOur use of open source software could compromise our ability to offer our services and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe use open source software in connection with our products and services. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open source software and compliance with open source license terms. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute software containing open source software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to the licensee's software that incorporates, links or uses such open source software, and make available to third parties for no cost, any derivative works of the open source code created by the licensee, which could include the licensee's own valuable proprietary code. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, or could be claimed to have occurred, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous. Any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could harm our business and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to monitor for such infringement and file infringement claims, both of which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may construe the patent's claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in a proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees, our consultants, or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other technology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and our consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that our employees, our consultants, or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Costly litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings against us relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary information, the value of our technology, products, and services could be hurt.\nWe may not be able to protect our trade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary information adequately. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect this proprietary information and technology, our employees, consultants, and other parties may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information or technology to competitors. In addition, our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information may be accessed or disclosed during a cyber incident, which could have a significant negative impact on us. Further, such cyber incidents, if disclosed publicly, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nEnforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our proprietary information or technology is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary information. We rely, in part, on non-disclosure, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, and other parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property and proprietary information. These agreements may not be self-executing, or they may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach. Moreover, third parties may independently develop similar or equivalent proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary information.\nRisks Related to Industry Regulation and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nThe healthcare regulatory and political framework is uncertain and evolving.\nHealthcare laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was adopted, which is a healthcare reform measure that seeks to contain healthcare costs while improving quality and access to coverage. The ACA includes a variety of healthcare reform provisions and requirements that have already become effective and substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, which may significantly affect our industry and our business. In addition, other legislation expanding or modifying the ACA may be considered by Congress in the future.\nOn October 24, 2018, President Trump signed legislation into law aimed at curbing the opioid crisis in the U.S. The SUPPORT Act includes provisions that address law enforcement, public health, and coverage under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Broad in scope, the legislation increases federal oversight with respect to the production and distribution of opioids, bolsters fraud prevention safeguards, enhances oversight of prescription opioids, expands coverage of opioid addiction treatment services, and authorizes consumer education and provider training programs aimed at preventing and treating opioid use disorders. The potential for additional regulatory oversight and enforcement will likely add to the costs associated with the prescription and any downstream handling of medications. Whether it impacts medication management companies or health plans is difficult to determine without seeing the implementing regulations, but given the intent to crack down on opioid abuse in this country, it is likely that more time, attention and personnel will be required to ensure compliance. Implementation of the SUPPORT Act has been slow to occur. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, given the continued scrutiny of prescription opioids by the U.S. Congress, or predict what the impact of future regulations generated by the SUPPORT Act, if any,\nmay be.\nOn October 10, 2018, two pieces of legislation were enacted to enhance drug price transparency-the Know the Lowest Price Act (S. 2553) and the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act (S. 2554). Each prevents various parties from instituting \u201cgag\u201d orders or clauses against pharmacists and pharmacies, which heretofore may have prevented a pharmacist from disclosing the lowest available price of a drug to a consumer. These laws may have a financial impact on insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, as they may have to develop more competitive pricing in certain situations.\nAdditionally, a significant amount of our business depends on the evolution of the health care environment and concomitant clinical integration and care coordination, including certain demonstration projects operated by the federal government. If these demonstration projects are modified, cancelled, or not ultimately made permanent as part of federal health care programs, this might affect demand for the types of services we provide. In 2020, CMS and OIG finalized rules as part of the federal government\u2019s \u201cRegulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care\u201d initiative. The impact of these rules is still unknown, but they focus on protecting and encouraging certain value-based arrangements.\nIn addition, we are subject to various other healthcare laws and regulations, including, among others, the Stark Law relating to self-referrals, anti-kickback laws, including the federal AKS, antitrust laws and the data privacy and security laws and regulations described below. For instance, the CCPA imposes rules governing how businesses handle personal data of California residents. Companies that do business in California will be required to disclose the types of data they collect, the purpose for the data collection, and how the data will be used, as well as expand organizational responsibilities pertaining to individual rights, accountability, and governance. Companies subject to the CCPA must have complied by January 1, 2020. There were additional regulatory provisions and legislative amendments related to the CCPA during 2020, including the passage of the CPRA. The CPRA modifies the CCPA and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California effective January 1, 2023. If we were to become subject to litigation or liabilities or found to be out of compliance with these or other laws, our business could be hurt. We may become subject to litigation, which could be costly and result in significant liability.\nWe are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and contractual obligations governing the transmission, security, and privacy of health and other sensitive or proprietary information, which may impose restrictions on the manner in which we access, store, transmit, use, and disclose such information and subject us to penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws or contractual provisions.\nAs described below, we are required to comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, storage, and transmission of individually identifiable health information that we may obtain or have access to in connection with the provision of our services. These laws and regulations, including their interpretation by governmental agencies, are subject to frequent change. These laws and regulations include the following.\n\u25cf The HIPAA and its implementing regulations required expanded protection of the privacy and security of protected health information. Also required are the execution of certain contracts to safeguard protected health information and the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information for health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers, which we refer to as Covered Entities, and their business associates. Among the standards that HHS has adopted pursuant to HIPAA are standards for electronic transactions and code sets, unique identifiers for providers, employers, health plans and individuals, security, electronic signatures, privacy, and enforcement. Actual failure to comply with HIPAA could result in fines and civil and criminal penalties, as well as contractual damages, which could harm our business, finances, and reputation.\n\u25cf The HITECH Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the \u201cStimulus Bill,\u201d effective February 22, 2010, modified HIPAA by setting forth health information security breach notification requirements and increasing penalties for violations of HIPAA, among other things. The HITECH Act requires individual notification for all breaches as defined by HIPAA, media notification of breaches affecting over 500 individuals located in the same region and either prompt or annual reporting of breaches to HHS, depending on the number of affected individuals. The HITECH Act also replaced the prior monetary penalty system of $100 per violation and an annual maximum of $25,000 per violation with a four-tier system of sanctions for breaches. Penalties now range from a minimum of $100 per violation and an annual maximum of $25,000 per violation for the first tier to a minimum of\n$50,000 per violation and an annual maximum of $1.5 million per violation for the fourth tier. Failure to comply with HIPAA as modified by the HITECH Act could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions and reputational damage that could harm our business.\n\u25cf Numerous other federal and state laws may apply that restrict the use and disclosure and mandate the protection of the privacy and security of individually identifiable information, as well as employee personal information, and that require notifications and mitigation in the event of a breach. These include state medical information privacy laws, state social security number protection laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, among others. These various laws in many cases are not preempted by HIPAA and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clients and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity, and liability.\n\u25cf Federal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and states' attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal or individually identifiable information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content.\nThere is ongoing concern from privacy advocates, regulators and others regarding data protection and privacy issues, and the number of jurisdictions with data protection and privacy laws has been increasing. In addition, the scope of protection afforded to data subjects by many of these data protection and privacy laws has been increasing. Also, there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for deidentified, anonymous, or pseudonomized health information are sufficient, and the risk of re-identification sufficiently small, to adequately protect patient privacy. These discussions may lead to further restrictions on the use of such information. These initiatives or future initiatives could compromise our ability to access and use data or to develop or market current or future services.\nThe security measures that we and our third-party vendors and subcontractors have in place to ensure compliance with privacy and data protection laws and contractual commitments may not protect our facilities and systems from security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, cyber incidents, misplaced or lost data, programming and human errors, or other similar events. The occurrence of a cyber incident that affects either individually identifiable health information or other confidential or proprietary information with which we have been entrusted may result in liability and hurt our reputation.\nAdditionally, as a business associate under HIPAA, we may also be liable for privacy and security breaches of protected health information and certain similar failures of our subcontractors. Even though we contractually require our subcontractors to safeguard protected health information as required by law, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. An actual or perceived breach of privacy or security of individually identifiable health information held by us or by our subcontractors may result in an enforcement action, including criminal and civil liability, against us, as well as negative publicity, reputational harm, and contractual ramifications with our clients.\nWe are not able to predict the full extent of the impact such incidents may have on our business if such incidents occur. Any failure we may have in complying with HIPAA may result in criminal or civil liability, and due to the heightened enforcement climate and recent changes to the law, the potential for enforcement action against business associates under HIPAA is now greater than in prior years. Enforcement actions against us could be costly and could interrupt regular operations, which may harm our business. While we have not received any notices of violation of the applicable privacy and data protection laws and believe we adequately protect our information, including in compliance with such laws, there can be no assurance that we will not receive such notices in the future. Further, costly breaches can occur regardless of our compliance infrastructure.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and must comply with a significant number of complex and evolving requirements. Achieving and sustaining compliance with state and federal statutes and regulation related to the healthcare industry may prove costly. Changes in these laws could restrict our ability to conduct our business. Further, if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur significant penalties and our reputation could suffer.\nIn addition to HIPAA, additional federal and state statutes, regulations, guidance and contractual provisions regarding healthcare that may apply to our business activities, including:\n\u25cf The AKS prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully paying, offering, receiving or soliciting anything of value in order to induce the referral of patients or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, arranging for, or recommending services or goods covered in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs. The AKS is an intent-based statute and the failure of an arrangement to satisfy all elements of a safe harbor will not necessarily make it illegal, but it may subject that arrangement to scrutiny by enforcement authorities. Any violation of the AKS can lead to significant penalties, including criminal penalties, civil fines, and exclusion from participation in a federal healthcare program, among other penalties.\n\u25cf Various state anti-kickback laws that sometimes track federal AKS prohibitions, although some apply to all-payers as opposed to only government healthcare programs.\n\u25cf The federal physician self-referral law, often referred to as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain designated health services, or DHS, among them outpatient prescription medications, if the physician or a member of such physician\u2019s immediate family has a financial relationship (including an ownership or investment interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, unless the financial relationship meets an exception to the self-referral prohibition. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such DHS if the financial relationship fails to meet the requirements of an exception. The Stark Law is considered a \u201cstrict liability\u201d statute in that a referral from a physician with a financial relationship that does not meet the requirements of an exception is strictly prohibited by the Stark Law. A violation of the Stark Law is punishable by civil sanctions, including overpayment liability, significant fines, and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n\u25cf State data privacy and security laws that track federal requirements or impose more stringent or different requirements than HIPAA regarding storage, transmission, use and disclosure of protected health information, general individually identifiable information, or other sensitive information. The CCPA imposes rules governing how businesses handle personal data of California residents. Companies that do business in California are required to disclose the types of data they collect, the purpose for the data collection, how the data will be used, as well as expand organizational responsibilities pertaining to individual rights, accountability, and governance. Companies subject to the CCPA have complied by January 1, 2020 and will need to comply with applicable CPRA requirements by January 1, 2023.\n\u25cf Consumer protection laws require us to publish statements to users of our services that describe how we handle personal information. If such information that we publish is considered untrue, we may be subject to claims of deceptive practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences, including, costs of defending against litigation, settling claims, and loss of willingness of current and potential future clients to work with us.\n\u25cf Federal and state false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, impose civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities that knowingly submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government or knowingly make, or cause to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid, or knowingly and improperly avoid or decrease an obligation due the federal government, such as the knowing retention of an identified overpayment. The civil False Claims Act provides for treble damages and mandatory minimum penalties per false claim or statement. In this context, it is particularly notable that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from services provided to PACE organizations. PACE organizations are funded by both Medicare and Medicaid, and the Medicare risk-adjustment methodology applies to the Medicare component of PACE organization reimbursement. PACE submissions may also be comparable to\nstate Medicaid risk-adjustment submissions, and vary by state. Because risk adjustment submissions to Medicare and state Medicaid programs have a direct impact on the amounts that Medicare and Medicaid programs pay to PACE organizations, these activities may be the subject of scrutiny and litigation under the federal civil False Claims Act.\n\u25cf The HHS OIG and many state Medicaid agencies maintain lists of individuals and organizations that have been excluded from participation in a federal healthcare program. A significant part of our revenue is derived from our services as federal healthcare program providers, pharmacies, or contractors to federal healthcare program providers or plans and, as such, we need to comply with restrictions on employing or contracting with personnel and vendors who have been excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. Adhering to the best practice of conducting monthly screenings against the federal and state exclusion lists for employees and contractors may be costly and resource-consuming, but failure to do so may give rise to significant administrative liability and sanctions.\n\u25cf As contractors to PACE organizations and Medicare Advantage organizations, or MAOs, we are subject to contractual provisions, which impose on us various obligations related to healthcare compliance and healthcare fraud, waste and abuse reduction and elimination efforts. These obligations stem from the provisions contained in prime contracts between PACE organizations and MAOs, and the federal government. Examples of such flow-down provisions include subcontractor\u2019s compliance with all applicable state and federal laws, subcontractor\u2019s obligation to screen state and federal exclusion lists and obligation to conduct periodic audits, among many others. Breaches of these requirements would not necessarily be a regulatory risk per se, but they could create contract compliance issues, which may yield contractual damages, be costly to resolve and may hurt our reputation and restrict our ability to service such organizations in the future.\n\u25cf Various state licensure, registration, and certification laws are applicable to pharmacies, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, other pharmacy personnel, and insurance administrators. If we are unable to maintain our licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on non-resident pharmacies, this could limit or affect our ability to operate in some states. Additionally, if we or any of our personnel violate conditions of their pharmacy or pharmacist licensure, we could face penalties and lose valuable personnel.\n\u25cf A number of federal and state laws and registration requirements are applicable to the purchase, handling, and dispensing of controlled substances. If we are unable to maintain our registrations this could limit or affect our ability to purchase, handle, or dispense controlled substances and other violations of these laws could subject us to criminal or other sanctions.\n\u25cf Federal and state laws and policies require pharmacies to maintain, enroll, and participate in federal healthcare programs or to report specified changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these programs. If we do not comply with these laws, we may not be able to participate in some federal healthcare programs, which could compromise our ability to sell our solutions.\n\u25cf A number of FDA regulations and guidance documents are relevant to our business. Some technologies and software applications used in healthcare analytics, genomic testing, and analysis are considered medical devices and are subject to regulation by the FDA. However, the 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law in 2016, created new statutory exemptions for medical-related software, and the FDA has issued draft guidance documents for its proposed interpretation of these exemptions and policies of enforcement discretion for software and related technologies. If the FDA determines that any of our current or future services, technologies, or software applications are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, we would become subject to various laws, regulations, and policies enforced by the FDA or other governmental authorities, including both premarket and post-market requirements, and we would need to bring the affected services, technologies, or software into compliance with such requirements. The FDA could also require that we cease marketing and/or recall the affected services, technologies, and software unless and until we bring them into compliance with FDA\u2019s requirements. The FDA also regulates COVID-19 tests and generally requires EUA or other premarket approval for such products. Our marketing and sale of COVID-19 tests must be consistent with the applicable terms of FDA\u2019s EUA approval letters and the relevant state laws governing prescription devices and clinical tests. The FDA and state regulators, such as\nstate boards of pharmacy, also regulate drug packaging and repackaging. Our drug packaging activities must comply with the relevant FDA and state statutes, regulations, and policies. Noncompliance with applicable FDA or state requirements, including those related to pharmaceutical and medical device promotional practices and the pre-market and post-market approval requirements for medical devices can result in an enforcement action that could substantially harm our business. Changes in existing regulatory requirements, our failure to comply with current or future requirements, or adoption of new requirements could negatively affect our business.\n\u25cf Clinical laboratories that perform human genomic testing are subject to oversight by CMS and state regulators, including the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018. If the laboratories that we partner with for genomic testing are not in compliance with the applicable CMS or state laws or regulations, they could be subject to enforcement action, which could negatively affect our business.\nFurther modifications to the Medicare Part D program and changes in pricing benchmarks may reduce revenue and impose additional costs on the industry.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 included a major expansion of the Medicare program with the addition of a prescription drug benefit under the new Medicare Part D program. The continued impact of these regulations on our business and operations depends upon a variety of factors, including our ongoing relationships with the Part D plans and the patient mix of our clients. Future modifications to the Medicare Part D program may reduce revenue and impose additional costs on the industry. In addition, contracts and fee schedules in the prescription drug industry, including our contracts with certain of our clients use certain published benchmarks, including average wholesale price, or AWP, to establish pricing for prescription drugs. Most of our contracts utilize the AWP standard. However, there can be no assurance that our clients will continue to utilize AWP, as previously calculated, or that other pricing benchmarks will not be adopted to establish prices for prescription drugs within the industry.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGreenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Such events could have a negative effect on our business. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation, and utility increases and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business. There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability matters, including the use of plastic, energy, waste, and worker safety. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not, or are perceived to not, act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, will continue to have the ability to influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers and directors, combined with our stockholders who own more than five percent of our outstanding capital stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own shares representing approximately 47% of our capital stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they may be able to influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. This concentration of ownership control may:\n\u25cf delay, defer, or prevent a change in control;\n\u25cf entrench our management and the board of directors; or\n\u25cf impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may desire.\nAs a result, these executive officers, directors, and current five percent or greater stockholders could pursue transactions that may not be in our best interests and which could harm our business.\nSome provisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, among other things:\n\u25cf divide our board of directors into three staggered classes of directors that are each elected to three-year terms;\n\u25cf provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25cf provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u25cf prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u25cf prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of the board of directors, the chairman of our board or the chief executive officer; and\n\u25cf require advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominees.\nBecause we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, which may discourage, delay, or prevent someone from acquiring us, or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under the DGCL, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nThese and other provisions could have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a transaction involving a change in control of our company or could make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or to cause us to take other corporate actions that you desire.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, (d) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or (e) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. We refer to each of these proceedings as a \u201ccovered proceeding\u201d. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if any action the subject matter of which is a covered proceeding is filed in a court other than the specified Delaware courts without the approval of our board of directors, which we refer to as a \u201cforeign action\u201d, the claiming party will be deemed to have consented to (1) the personal jurisdiction of the specified Delaware courts in connection with any action brought in any such courts to enforce the exclusive forum\nprovision described above and (2) having service of process made upon such claiming party in any such enforcement action by service upon such claiming party's counsel in the foreign action as agent for such claiming party. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. These provisions may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the Exchange Act or the Securities Act or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nThe price of our common stock historically has been volatile. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock. This volatility may also impact assessments over the potential impairment of our assets.\nThe market price for our common stock has varied between a high of $52.55 and a low of $4.67 in the twelve-month period ending on February 24, 2022. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\u201d; variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates; and announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nIn addition, the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact its price. As of February 16, 2022, we had outstanding approximately 25,731,807 shares of our common stock, of which approximately 1,857,971 are restricted, and options to purchase approximately 1,564,438 shares of our common stock (of which approximately 1,439,556 were exercisable) as of that date. The sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe volatility of our common stock may also impact assumptions utilized in our assessments of the fair value of our assets, including our goodwill and intangible assets, and a decline in our stock price could result in potential impairment charges to these assets. During first quarter of 2022 and through the date of this report, we experienced a sustained decline in the price of our common stock. If the stock price continues to decline or remains depressed, we may be required to assess our assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, for impairment, which may result in possible impairment charges for 2022.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating.\nWe may identify material weaknesses and other deficiencies in the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting, which may require remediation to correct in order to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are operating effectively. Completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly. We may not detect errors on a timely basis and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the Nasdaq Global Market, on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require us to obtain additional financial and management resources.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and other pre-change federal tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We may experience ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership that could limit the use of our NOLs. State NOL carryforwards may be similarly or more stringently limited. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, under the Tax Act, the amount of post-2017 NOLs that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL deduction itself. In addition, the Tax Act generally eliminates the ability to carry back any NOL to prior taxable years, while allowing post-2017 unused NOLs to be carried forward indefinitely. There is a risk that due to changes under the Tax Act, regulatory changes, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 1.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2026 that we issued in February 2019, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would intensify the risks discussed above.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the 2026 Convertible Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt, or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the 2026 Convertible Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the 2026 Convertible Notes when due. Our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if the facility matures or is repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2026 Convertible Notes in cash or to repurchase the 2026 Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2026 Convertible Notes.\nHolders of the 2026 Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2026 Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2026 Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2026 Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or the 2026 Convertible Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the 2026 Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase 2026 Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2026 Convertible Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2026 Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn certain circumstances specified in the indenture governing the 2026 Convertible Notes, holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2026 Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2026 Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2026 Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Account Standard Update, or ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20), which updated the previous accounting guidance for convertible debt instruments under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20. ASU 2020-06 requires a convertible debt instrument to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. We adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021 for purposes of accounting for the 2026 Convertible Notes. Interest expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations is closer to the coupon rate interest expense. In addition, the if-converted method, rather than the treasury stock method, must be used for the calculation of the diluted earnings per share calculation when accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which could adversely affect our diluted earnings per share.\nIn connection with the 2026 Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the 2026 Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes and/or their respective affiliates, which we refer to as the \u201coption counterparties\u201d. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the 2026 Convertible Notes. This activity may have increased (or reduced the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock at that time.\nIn addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2026 Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 2026 Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if any such convertible note hedge and warrant transactions fail to become effective, the option counterparties may unwind their hedge positions with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16308, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TRHC"}
