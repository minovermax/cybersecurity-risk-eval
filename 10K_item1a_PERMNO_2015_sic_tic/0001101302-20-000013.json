Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our common stock. Any of the following risks, many of which are beyond our control, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. We may also face other risks and uncertainties that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be material, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. For more information, see \u201cCautionary Statement\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nDeclines in the semiconductor industry or worldwide economic conditions may cause demand for our products to decrease and may adversely affect our business.\nDeclines in industry or worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect our business. Our revenue is primarily dependent upon demand from semiconductor manufacturers, which is largely driven by the current and anticipated demand for electronic products that utilize semiconductors. Despite recent increases in demand for semiconductors in applications such as smartphones, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, the semiconductor industry has historically been, and is likely to continue to be, highly cyclical with periodic significant downturns, resulting in significantly decreased demand for products such as ours. We have previously experienced significant revenue deterioration and operating losses due to severe downturns in the semiconductor industry, which often occur suddenly. The semiconductor industry is also affected by seasonal shifts in demand. We are unable to predict the timing, duration or severity of any future downturns in the semiconductor industry, and we could underperform the market or our peers.\nDuring downturns and periods of soft demand, our revenue is reduced, and we typically experience greater pricing pressure and shifts in product and customer mix, which often adversely affect our gross margin and net income. Even moderate seasonality can cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from one period to the next. Uncertain and volatile economic, political or business conditions in any of our key sales regions can cause or exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and have historically impacted customer demand for our products. These conditions can cause material adverse changes in our results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\na decline in demand for our products, which, given our limited backlog, will have an immediate impact on our revenues;\n\u2022\nan increase in reserves for accounts receivable due to our customers\u2019 inability to pay us;\n\u2022\nan increase in write-offs for excess or obsolete inventory that we cannot sell;\n\u2022\ngreater challenges in forecasting operating results, making business decisions, and identifying and prioritizing business risks; and\n\u2022\nadditional cost reduction efforts, including additional restructuring activities, which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities.\nFurthermore, to remain competitive, we must maintain a satisfactory level of engineering, research and development, invest in our infrastructure and maintain the ability to respond to any increases in demand and, as a result, a lower volume of sales can have a large and disproportionate impact on our profitability.\nThe industries we serve are constantly evolving, and any failure to manage our business effectively during periods of rapid change may adversely affect our business performance and results of operations.\nIntense competition in the semiconductor industry often leads to rapid changes in products and technology, and those changes can significantly alter demand for our products. Changes in demand may arise from factors such as advances in fabrication processes, new and emerging technologies, end-user demand, customers\u2019 production capacity and customers\u2019 capacity utilization. The amount and mix of spending on different products and solutions can have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nWe regularly reassess our allocation of resources in response to the changing business environment. To meet rapidly changing demand, we must accurately forecast demand for each of our products and effectively manage our resources and production capacity across our various businesses, and we may incur unexpected or additional costs to align our operations with demand. If we do not adequately adapt to changes in our business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly, resulting in excess fixed costs. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs,\nduring periods of decreasing demand, our gross margins and earnings will usually be adversely impacted. Especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated the correct mix of industry changes. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on our management\u2019s ability to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.\nOur ability to increase sales of our products, particularly our capital equipment products, depends in part upon our ability in a very short timeframe to ramp up our manufacturing capacity and to mobilize our supply chain. If we are unable to expand our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, manage the expansion effectively and obtain larger quantities of raw materials, our customers could obtain such products from our competitors, which would reduce our market share. Additionally, we typically operate our business on a just-in-time shipment basis with a modest level of inventory, ordering supplies and planning production based on internal demand forecasts. The failure to accurately forecast demand for our products, in terms of both volume and product type, has in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, delays in product shipments and disappointment of customer expectations, as well as an increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory.\nOur revenues and operating results are variable.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. We manage our expenses based in part on our expectations of future revenues. Because some of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, a change in the timing of revenue or the amount of profit we generate from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular period. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include:\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in the semiconductor industry;\n\u2022\nthe size and timing of customer orders;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of our customers could impact their purchasing decisions and negatively affect our revenues;\n\u2022\nprocurement shortages;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing difficulties;\n\u2022\ncustomer cancellations of or delays in shipments, installations or customer acceptances;\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 rate of replacement of our consumable products;\n\u2022\nchanges in average selling prices, customer mix, and product mix;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce, and market new, enhanced, and competitive products in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 introduction of new products;\n\u2022\nlegal or technical challenges to our products or technologies;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in transportation, communication, demand, information technology, or supply, including strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities, and natural or man-made disasters;\n\u2022\nlegal, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes (including changes in import/export regulations and tariffs) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in our estimated tax rate; and\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe depend on single and limited source suppliers and an interruption in our ordinary sources of supply could affect our ability to manufacture our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on single or limited source suppliers for raw materials, such as plastic polymers, filtration membranes, petroleum coke and other materials, which are critical to the manufacturing of our products. If we were to lose any one of these sources, it could be difficult for us to find an alternative supplier and we would need to qualify this new source through our customers\u2019 rigorous qualification processes. Although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, the partial or complete loss of any of these sources could interrupt our manufacturing operations and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAt times, we have experienced a limited supply of certain raw materials, which has resulted in delays, lost revenue, increased costs and risks associated with qualifying products made from such new raw materials with our customers. Events such as an industry-wide increase in demand for, or the discontinuation of, raw materials used in our products could harm our ability to\nacquire sufficient quantities and our manufacturing operations may be interrupted. For example, in 2019, we experienced a disruption in the supply of certain ceramic material for use in our coatings business in our SCEM division when the supplier was unable to produce these materials at the required specifications. In response, we worked collaboratively with the supplier to determine the root cause and to solve the manufacturing issue, reestablishing the supply of these materials. Although we were able to reestablish our supply of this raw material, we may be unable to do so in the future or with other raw materials, in which case raw materials shortages may adversely affect our operations. Additionally, our suppliers may not have the capacity to meet increases in our demand for raw materials, in turn, making it difficult for us to meet demand from our customers. Furthermore, prices for our raw materials can vary widely. While we have long-term arrangements with certain key suppliers that fix our price for the purchase of certain raw materials, if the cost of our raw materials increases and we are unable to correspondingly increase the sales price of our products or find other cost savings, our profit margins will decline.\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business as a significant amount of our sales and manufacturing activity occur outside the United States.\nSales to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 76%, 78% and 79% of our net sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a majority of our net sales. In addition, a number of our key domestic customers derive a significant portion of their revenues from sales in international markets. We also manufacture a significant portion of our products outside the United States and are dependent on international suppliers for many of our parts and raw materials. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in both sales and manufacturing internationally. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks and potential costs that could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, including:\n\u2022\nunanticipated government actions, laws, rules, regulations and policies, such as \u201ctrade wars,\u201d tariffs, sanctions or other changes in international trade requirements that affect our business and that of our customers and suppliers, any of which that could impose additional costs on our operations, and limit our ability to operate our business;\n\u2022\nchallenges in hiring and integrating workers in different countries;\n\u2022\nchallenges in managing a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, along with differing employment practices and labor issues;\n\u2022\nchallenges of maintaining appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls and complying with legal, environmental, health and safety, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements that vary by jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nchallenges in developing relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;\n\u2022\nfluctuating pricing and availability of raw materials and supply chain interruptions;\n\u2022\nexpense and complexity of complying with U.S. and foreign import and export regulations, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency including Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Korean won, Chinese yuan, Singapore dollar or Malaysian ringgit, which could cause our sales and profitability to decline;\n\u2022\nliability for foreign taxes assessed at rates higher than those applicable to our domestic operations;\n\u2022\ncustomer or government efforts to encourage operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China, including efforts to develop and grow local competitors, requiring local manufacturing, and providing special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and uncertainty, which may result in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of sovereign debt, declining valuation of certain investments, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, and volatility in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability.\nIn the past, these factors have disrupted our operations and increased our costs, and we expect that these factors will continue to do so in the future.\nTariffs, trade restrictions and other protectionist measures resulting from international trade disputes or strained international relations could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nTariffs, export controls, additional taxes, trade barriers or sanctions, particularly those arising or that may arise out of U.S.-China relations, may increase costs of raw materials and our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. For example, effective October 30, 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce restricted exports to a Chinese semiconductor manufacturing company and may impose further restrictions on this or other semiconductor manufacturers or industry participants. In 2019, U.S. and China implemented several rounds of tariff increases and retaliations. Also in 2019, trade tensions between Japan and Korea resulted in trade restrictions on several chemicals sold from Japan to Korea that are used in the production of advanced semiconductors. While these particular events did not have a direct material adverse effect on our revenue, other restrictions could impact our ability to serve customers in the regions in which we operate, which could reduce our revenue. In addition, the importation of gas canisters and chemicals viewed as dangerous has come under increased regulatory scrutiny by governmental officials in China. As a result, we have established partnerships with local suppliers. However, this increased regulation may impair the ability of our SCEM segment to import those products into China and may cause us to lose sales. Furthermore, there have historically been strained relations between China and Taiwan, Japan and Korea and there are continuing tensions between North Korea and other countries, including South Korea and the United States. Any adverse developments in those relations could significantly disrupt the worldwide production of semiconductors, which may lead to reduced sales of our products.\nA significant amount of our sales is concentrated on a limited number of key customers and, therefore, our net sales and profitability may materially decline if we lost one or more of these customers.\nSales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability. Our top ten customers accounted for 43%, 44% and 47% of our net sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our customers could stop using our products in their manufacturing processes with limited advance notice to us and we would have limited or no contractual remedy for them doing so. The cancellation, reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by even a single customer could significantly reduce our revenues in any particular quarter. If we were to lose any of our significant customers, if our products are not specified for these customers\u2019 products or production processes, or if we suffer a material reduction in their purchase orders, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Due to the long design and development cycle and lengthy customer product qualification periods required for most of our new products, we may be unable to replace these customers quickly, if at all.\nFurthermore, the semiconductor industry has been undergoing, and is expected to continue to undergo, consolidation. If any of our customers merge or are acquired, we may experience lower overall sales from the merged or combined companies. In addition, our principal customers also hold considerable purchasing power and may be able to negotiate sales terms that result in decreased pricing, increased costs, and/or lower margins for us, and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and respond to rapid technological change and customer requirements by continuing to innovate and introduce new and enhanced products and solutions, our business could be seriously harmed.\nThe semiconductor industry is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer requirements and frequent new product introductions. In our industry, the first company to introduce an innovative product meeting an identified customer need will often have a significant advantage over competing products. For this reason, we make significant cash expenditures to research, develop, engineer and market new products and make significant capital investments in technology and manufacturing capacity in advance of future business developing and without any purchase commitment from our customers. We incurred $121.1 million, $118.5 million and $107.0 million for engineering, research and development expense in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, to support new product and technology development. Following development, it may take a number of years for sales of a new product to reach a substantial level, if ever. If a product concept does not progress beyond the development stage or only achieves limited acceptance in the marketplace, we may not receive a direct return on our expenditures, we may lose market share and our revenue and our profitability may decline. For example, in the past, we incurred significant impairment charges for capital expenditures relating to developing the capability to manufacture shippers and FOUPs for 450 mm wafers, for which major semiconductor manufacturers announced that they would not initiate manufacturing in the foreseeable future.\nWe believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to develop mission-critical solutions to maximize our customers\u2019 manufacturing yields and enable higher performance semiconductor devices. A failure to successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes by developing, marketing and manufacturing new products or enhancements to our existing products could harm our business prospects and significantly reduce our sales. For example, as 3D NAND technology advances to higher densities, the conventional process used to etch critical features no longer works. Recognizing the need for a new chemistry, we developed a series of prototype formulations for highly selective nitride etch and developed a specialized liquid filter to remove contaminants but maintain the critical components in the chemistry that make it function. While we\nbelieve we are well positioned for selection as process-of-record for these certain etch processes and we are preparing for rapid, high-volume ramp once the final selection is made, we may not be selected by the customer and may not generate significant revenue from these solutions. We cannot assure you that the new products and technology we choose to develop and market in the ordinary course of our business will be successful. In addition, if new products have reliability or quality problems, we may experience reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance and payment, additional service and warranty expense, and damage to our reputation.\nCompetition from new or existing companies could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have better-established customer relationships than we do, which may enable them to have their products specified for use more frequently and more quickly by these customers. We also face competition from smaller, regional companies, which focus on serving those customers in their same region. Another source of competition is from the manufacturing engineering teams of our customers, who continually evaluate the benefits of internal manufacturing versus outsourcing. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and a loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, we expect that existing and new competitors will improve the design of their existing products and will introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics. The introduction of new products or more efficient production of existing products by our competitors could diminish our market share and increase pricing pressure on our products.\nWe may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or divest businesses, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe intend to continue to engage in business combinations, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments or other types of collaborations to address gaps in our product offerings, adjust our business and product portfolio to meet our ongoing strategic objectives, diversify into complementary markets, increase our scale or accomplish other strategic objectives. These transactions involve numerous risks to our business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nexperiencing difficulty in identifying suitable acquisition candidates and completing selected transactions at appropriate valuations, in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all, due to substantial competition for acquisition targets;\n\u2022\ninability to successfully integrate any acquisitions into our existing business operations;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize the anticipated synergies or other benefits of any such transaction;\n\u2022\nentering into markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\nfinding acquirors and obtaining adequate value in connection with divesting businesses that no longer meet our objectives;\n\u2022\ninability to complete proposed transactions due to failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals;\n\u2022\nrequirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of our existing business or the acquired business;\n\u2022\nundertaking multiple transactions at the same time in order to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that do arise, which could strain our ability to effectively execute and integrate such transactions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day business due to dedication of significant management resources to such transactions;\n\u2022\nemployee uncertainty and lack of focus during integration process that may also disrupt our business;\n\u2022\nthe risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people, potentially located in regions where we have not historically conducted or operated our business;\n\u2022\ndependence on unfamiliar or less secure supply chains and inefficient scale of the acquired entity;\n\u2022\ndespite our due diligence, we could assume unknown, underestimated or contingent liabilities, such as potential environmental, health and safety liabilities of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nan acquired technology or product may have inadequate or invalid intellectual property protection or may be subject to claims of infringement by a third party, which may result in lower than anticipated revenue or claims for damages;\n\u2022\nwe could experience negative effects on our reported results of operations from dilutive results from operations and/or from future potential impairment of acquired assets, including goodwill, related to future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nan acquired company may have inadequate or ineffective internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy, environmental, health and safety, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;\n\u2022\nreductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or customers of an acquired business.\nFor example, an inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the Anow, MPD Chemical and DSC acquisitions we completed in 2019, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, which may adversely affect the value of the shares of our common stock.\nManufacturing interruptions or delays could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing processes are complex and require the use of expensive and technologically sophisticated equipment and materials. These processes are frequently modified to improve manufacturing yields and product quality. We have, on occasion, experienced manufacturing difficulties, such as critical equipment breakdowns or the introduction of impurities in the manufacturing process. Any future manufacturing difficulties could cause lower yields, make our products unmarketable and/or delay deliveries to customers. In addition, any modification to the manufacturing process of our products could require that the affected product be re-qualified by our customers, which can increase our costs and delay our ability to sell this product to our customers. These and other manufacturing difficulties may result in the loss of sales and exposure to warranty and product liability claims.\nSome of our products are manufactured at only one or two facilities in different countries. A disruption at these facilities could impact sales of those products until another facility could commence or expand production of those products. We have in the past moved, and we may in the future move, the manufacture of certain products from one plant to another. If we fail to transfer and re-establish the manufacturing processes in the destination plant efficiently and effectively, we may not be able to meet customer demand, we may lose credibility with our customers and our business may be harmed. Even if we successfully move our manufacturing processes, we may not achieve any anticipated cost savings or efficiencies.\nOur operations use hazardous materials, which expose us to various risks, including potential liability for personal injury and potential remediation obligations.\nOur operations involve, and we are exposed to the risks associated with, the use and manufacture of hazardous materials. In particular, we manufacture specialty chemicals, which is inherently hazardous and may result in accidents, and store and transport hazardous raw materials, products and waste in, to and from various facilities. Potential risks which may disrupt our operations or expose us to significant losses and liabilities include explosions and fires, chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures. Those hazards may result in liability for personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, suspension of operations, the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions, cleanup costs, claims by governmental entities or third-parties, reputational harm, increase in our insurance costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. Moreover, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of the customer. For example, while we believe that our SDS and VAC delivery systems are the safest available in the industry to transport, store and deliver toxic gases, any leakage could cause serious damage, including injury or death to any person exposed to those toxic gases, potentially creating significant product liability exposure for us. Our insurance may be inadequate to satisfy any such liabilities, and our financial results or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nLoss of any of our key personnel could harm our business, and our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully.\nMany of our key personnel have significant experience in the semiconductor industry and deep technical expertise. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or an inability to attract, train and retain qualified and skilled employees, specifically research and development and engineering personnel, could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully. As the semiconductor industry has experienced growth in recent years, competition among industry participants for qualified talent, particularly those with significant industry experience, has intensified. As a result, the difficulty and costs associated with attracting and retaining key employees has risen and may continue to rise.\nIf we fail to obtain, protect and enforce intellectual property rights, our business and prospects could be harmed.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights. We rely on patent, trade secret and trademark law to protect many of our major product platforms. Although we have filed applications for additional patents, our pending applications may not be approved. Moreover, any patents that we own or obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantage, and these patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised by third parties. We may not develop additional proprietary technology. In addition, any failure to obtain intellectual property protection in the international jurisdictions we serve could expose us to increased competition, which could limit our growth and future revenue. Although we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain third parties to protect our proprietary information and technology, these agreements may be inadequate to protect our interests, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Furthermore, third parties may be able to replicate or obtain our confidential and proprietary information and technology through lawful means, and they may also be able to design around our patents. Any weakness in our ability to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties may misappropriate our intellectual property rights, and disputes as to ownership of intellectual property rights may arise. We may institute litigation in order to enforce our patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights. For example, since 2015, we have had a pending litigation where we enforced our patent rights against Gudeng Precision Inc., Ltd. for their infringing acts related to reticle pods. We continue to vigorously defend our patents and rights, which will incur costs. We may initiate other costly patent litigation against our competitors or other third parties in order to protect and/or perfect our intellectual property rights. We cannot predict how any existing or future litigation will be resolved or what impact it may have on us.\nOur commercial success also depends, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating any patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. If we infringe or misappropriate a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights, we could be required to pay damages to such third party, alter our products or processes, obtain a license from the third party or cease utilizing such proprietary rights, including making or selling products utilizing such proprietary rights. If we are required to obtain a license from a third party, we may be unable to do so on commercially acceptable terms or at all.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by climate change, natural catastrophes or public health crises, in the locations in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate.\nWe have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to severe weather and natural catastrophes, such as typhoons in Taiwan and China, earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan, hurricanes in east Texas (Hurricane Harvey) and in Florida (Hurricane Irma), each in 2017, wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018 and in Colorado in 2012 and flooding in Arkansas in 2019. Our suppliers and customers also have operations in locations exposed to similar dangers. A natural disaster could disrupt our operations, or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have continuity plans designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on our operations, those plans may be insufficient, and any catastrophe may disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Also, climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our businesses. For example, new or modified regulations could require us to spend substantial funds to enhance our environmental compliance efforts. In addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. For example, December 2019 and January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan, China has resulted in travel disruption and has effected certain companies\u2019 operations in China. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our financial information, intellectual property, confidential information, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees and third parties, as well as similar information of our customers, suppliers and business partners. We maintain this information both in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. All information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. While we have implemented network security procedures, virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, access control, emergency recovery processes and internal control measures, we have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. Despite our precautions, information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could cause disruption in our operations, issues with customer communication and order management, the unintentional disclosure of sensitive information, the disruption in our\ntransaction processing or undermine the integrity of our disclosures controls and procedures and our internal control over our financial reporting, which could affect our reputation, result in significant liabilities and expenses, adversely affect our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMoreover, new laws and regulations, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act that became effective on January 1, 2019, add to the complexity of our compliance obligations, which increases our compliance costs, and a failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant liabilities and expenses.\nFailure to comply with the wide variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulatory requirements relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation, of, and human exposure to, hazardous chemicals could result in future liabilities or the suspension of production or shipment. These requirements have tended to become stricter over time. For example, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act modified the Toxic Control Substances Act, or TSCA, by requiring the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, to prioritize and evaluate the environmental and health risks of existing chemicals and provided the EPA with greater authority to regulate chemicals posing unreasonable risks. According to this statute, the EPA is required to make an affirmative finding that a new chemical will not pose an unreasonable risk before such chemical can go into production. As a result, TSCA has been updated so that it operates in a similar fashion to the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals, or REACH, legislation in Europe. Regulations similar to REACH have been enacted in South Korea and Taiwan. These laws and regulations, among others, increase the complexity and costs of transporting our products from the country in which they are manufactured to our customers. Any further changes to these and similar regulations in the countries in which we operate or sell into could restrict our ability to expand, build or acquire new facilities, require us to acquire costly control equipment, cause us to incur expenses associated with remediation of contamination, cause us to modify our manufacture or shipping processes, or otherwise increase our cost of doing business and have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment.\nWe are subject to various risks related to new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries where we operate; disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, immigration or travel regulations, and antitrust regulations, among others. Each of these laws, rules, and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management\u2019s attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply.\nTo maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations, and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in taxation or adverse tax rulings could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have facilities in many foreign countries and are subject to taxation at various rates and audit by multiple taxing authorities. Our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in the countries in which we operate or in the countries from which we purchase raw materials, changes in laws and regulations governing calculation and location of earned profit and taxation thereof, changes in laws and regulations affecting our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet and changes in laws and regulations relating to the repatriation of cash into the United States. Each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year in each tax jurisdiction. If our performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability would also likely change.\nWe have undertaken a number of complex internal reorganizations of our foreign subsidiaries in order to rationalize and streamline our foreign operations, focus our management efforts on certain local opportunities and take advantage of favorable business conditions in certain localities. Although we exercised diligence in undertaking these internal reorganizations, these reorganizations, or any future internal reorganization, could nonetheless result in adverse tax consequences in one or more tax\njurisdictions, which could adversely impact our profitability from foreign operations and result in a material reduction in our results of operations.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations, including limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, and the imposition or acceleration of taxation on certain foreign income, each of which may increase our tax expense. Both the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and subsequent regulations and interpretations require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As additional clarification and guidance is issued regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded, which may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nVarious other jurisdictions, including members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are considering changes to their tax laws, including provisions intended to address base erosion and profit shifting by taxpayers. Any tax reform adopted in these or other countries may exacerbate the risks described above.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and react to changes in our business.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have approximately an aggregate principal amount of $946.0 million indebtedness outstanding, including our 4.625% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2026, or the Notes, and our senior secured term loan facility due 2025, or the Term Loan Facility. In addition, we have approximately $300 million of unutilized capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility due 2023, or the Revolving Facility. We refer to the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility as the Credit Facilities, and the credit agreement that governs the Credit Facilities as the Credit Agreement.\nOur debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to increased interest expense for borrowings with variable interest rates, including borrowings under the Credit Facilities; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt having more favorable terms.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may incur substantially more debt, which could exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe may incur significant additional secured and unsecured indebtedness in the future. Although the indenture governing the Notes, or the Indenture, and the Credit Agreement restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, the restrictions have a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. For example, the Credit Agreement provides that we can request additional loans and commitments up to the greater of $400 million or 100% of our EBITDA, as well as additional amounts if our secured net leverage ratio is less than a specified ratio. Further, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring monetary obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If we add new indebtedness and other monetary obligations to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would intensify.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions, which may not be successful, to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe may be unable to maintain sufficient cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets, which are subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions, as well as many financial, business, legislative, political, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems, be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nAny refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. We may not be able to implement any refinancing on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, a refinancing may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds of the dispositions, and we may be unable to consummate any dispositions or generate proceeds sufficient to meet our debt service obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, holders of the Notes and lenders under the Credit Facilities could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Revolving Facility could terminate their commitments to advance further loans, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe terms of the credit agreement restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or raise additional funds.\nThe Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions that may limit our ability to take actions that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nalter the businesses we conduct; and\n\u2022\nmerge or sell all or substantially all of our assets or incur a change of control in our capital stock ownership.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants may, depending on the amount of revolving borrowings, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn letters of credit, require us to maintain a secured net leverage ratio, which we may be unable to meet. Also, the Indenture contains limited covenants, such as a covenant restricting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur certain debt secured by liens. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness, which could lead to bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future. In 2019, the closing price of our stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, ranged from a low of $27.43 to a high of $51.21, and, as in past years, the price of our common stock may show greater volatility. The trading price of our common stock is subject to significant volatility in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control or may be unrelated to our operating results, and which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe failure to meet the published expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\npress releases or announcements by, or changes in market values of, comparable companies;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the markets for high-technology stocks, general stock market price and volume fluctuations, which are particularly common among securities of high-technology companies;\n\u2022\nstock market price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels;\n\u2022\nthe public perception of equity values of publicly traded companies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our results of operations; and\n\u2022\nthe other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC.\nFluctuations in our results could cause our stock price to decline significantly. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance. Future decreases in our stock price may adversely impact our ability to raise sufficient additional capital in the future, if needed.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts.\nOur intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that such actions are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and applicable agreements. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of domestic cash flow; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we may decide at any time to reduce, suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends or the repurchase of shares. A reduction, suspension or discontinuation of our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, which could decrease the value of our shares.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations to which it applies from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could discourage others from bidding for our shares of common stock and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in the price of our common stock that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences. Any shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Any issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. Any issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88439, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ENTG"}
