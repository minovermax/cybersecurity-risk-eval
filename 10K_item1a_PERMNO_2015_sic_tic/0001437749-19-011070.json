RISK FACTORS\nIf we do not generate sufficient net cash flow from our operations and if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed, our financial condition would be adversely affected, we may not to be able to execute our growth strategy and we could become insolvent.\nWe cannot assure that we will generate cash from operations or other potential sources to fund our future working capital needs.\nWe incurred net losses of $1.0 million in fiscal 2019, and $3.1 million in fiscal 2018. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $28.5 million as of March 31, 2019. Beginning in fiscal 2012, we invested primarily in the development of our ASGA product platform for EW test and emulation applications, which we believe possesses greater long-term opportunities for revenue growth and improved gross margins compared to our previous general-purpose test and measurement product lines, the substantial majority of which have been sold as of March 31, 2018. Through March 31, 2019, the Company has spent approximately $20 million towards the development of the ASGA system product platform. Although we have shipped ASGA system products to several customers, potential delays in the refinement of further features, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to generate shipments in significant quantities, could significantly contribute to additional future losses.\nThe lack of adequate working capital from any inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to discontinue or suspend product lines, business segments or otherwise substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, we cannot assure that any necessary financing, if available, would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing shareholders. If our financial condition were to worsen and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or enter into other strategic transactions, we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy, and we would not be able to execute our growth strategy.\nOur recent losses and limited liquidity during most of Fiscal 2019 and prior fiscal years caused us to reduce product development expenditures and headcount.\nOur recent losses and limited liquidity caused us to reduce our R&D expenditures and headcount in fiscal 2019 and prior years. This prolonged reduction of R&D spending caused us to delay the development of certain features of our ASGA product platform. As a result of the Company\u2019s improved operating performance in fiscal 2019, due in part to the receipt of a $4.0 million ASGA product order in February 2019, the receipt of $2.5 million in gross proceeds from the sale of 6.0% Series E Senior Convertible Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries E Shares\u201d) between March 2018 and March 2019, and a projected increase in ASGA product sales in fiscal 2020, the Company anticipates hiring additional R&D personnel and incurring additional R&D expenditures during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Any delays in the receipt of future orders for our ASGA or other products would adversely impact our quarterly operating results during the second half of calendar 2020 and subsequent periods.\nWe face risks related to production delays, delays of customer orders and higher selling price of a new product platform.\nOur ASGA product platform has been our primarily product development focus during the past seven years, however, delays in completing its development, together with early design and manufacturing issues and longer than anticipated sales cycles have contributed to our losses and increased accumulated deficit as of March 30, 2019. Additionally, the average selling price of our new ASGA products is considerably higher that our prior general-purpose test and measurement products, which in turn, requires additional internal approvals on the part of the purchaser and generally leads to longer sales cycles. Our financial condition may also cause potential customers to delay, postpone or decide against placing orders for our products. Continued longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional losses.\nOur sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers.\nAll of our current product and service offerings are directed towards the defense marketplace which has a limited number of customers. If the defense market demand decreases, actual shipments could be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in sales. Additionally, the loss of any one customer may have a material adverse effect on future operating results and financial condition. Our product backlog also has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance of our products and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected shipments and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.\nOur markets involve rapidly changing technology and standards.\nThe market for electronics equipment is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop and commercialize our existing products, and in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new products and product lines with improved capabilities, and to continue to enhance existing products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development of current or future products, or that such products will achieve market acceptance. The inability to develop new products in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our operating performance and liquidity.\nPerformance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors\u2019 products may harm our business and reputation.\nProducts as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that a product might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined equipment environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally. To date, performance problems in our products or in other products used together with our products have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, management cannot be certain that a material adverse impact will not occur in the future.\nOur Advanced Signal Generation and Analysis system product platform is complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes.\nOur ASGA system products are extremely complex. Despite testing, our initial products contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors, or performance problems following its sale or when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel\u2019s attention from our product development efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins.\nOur products contain components produced by suppliers which may be discontinued or no longer available in future periods which could lead to production delays and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nCertain components produced by our suppliers may be discontinued or no longer available to us to produce our products. Such discontinuations would require us to seek replacement components that may take longer than expected to procure and lead to delays in product sales. To date, procurement of replacement products has not had a significant adverse impact on our operating results, however, such occurrences in the future may adversely impact our business operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with quality certifications and classified processing and control standards, product deliveries may be delayed or cancelled which would adversely impact our business, operating result and financial condition.\nCertain of our customer contracts require that we maintain quality certifications and classified processing and control standards. If we were unable to maintain such certifications and standards, our product shipments may be delayed or cancelled which would cause us to lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, making it difficult to predict future performance.\nOur revenue, expenses and operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors. Factors that may contribute to these fluctuations include our dependence on the defense industry and a limited number of customers, the nature and length of our sales cycles for our products and services, the duration and delivery schedules within our customer contracts, our ability to timely develop and produce our products, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock trades on the OTCQB Market, the trading volumes are generally low. As a result, there is limited liquidity for our common stock and it could be more difficult for investors to purchase or sell shares of our common stock compared to other publicly traded companies. In addition, because of the limited volume of trading in our common stock, a sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the open market could cause our stock price to decline significantly.\nOur common stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, receipt or cancellation of significant orders, reduction in revenues or lower earnings or increased losses and reduced levels of liquidity when compared to previous quarterly periods, and other factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or by our competitors, government regulations or developments in patent or other proprietary rights. In addition, the OTCQB Market and other stock markets have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. Some of these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the reported operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded. Broad market fluctuations, as well as general foreign and domestic economic conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock in the future, which could dilute a shareholder\u2019s ownership of common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, generally without shareholder approval, to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common or preferred stock could be dilutive to a shareholder\u2019s ownership of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could impair the voting, dividend and liquidation rights of common shareholders without their approval. To the extent that we issue options or warrants to purchase common stock in the future and the options or warrants are exercised, our shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, shareholders may not be permitted to invest in future issuances of our common or preferred stock.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants, options and shares of convertible preferred stock, which may cause significant dilution to our shareholders, adversely impact the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings.\nAs of March 30, 2019, we had 11,360,511 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, as of that date we had outstanding warrants to acquire 3,452,000 shares of common stock, options to acquire 2,735,000 shares of common stock and shares of convertible preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of 11,213,000 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants or options or conversion of preferred stock would dilute the percentage ownership interest of all holders of our common stock, might dilute the book value per share of our common stock and would increase the number of our publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe fact that our shareholders, warrant holders and option holders can sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.\nHolders of our outstanding preferred stock have rights that are preferential to and may conflict with the rights and interests of holders of our common stock.\nAs of March 30, 2019, we had 116,934 shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding with aggregate liquidation preferences of $7.2 million. In addition, we must obtain the approval of the holders of our Series E Shares to complete certain types of transactions. For example, the Certificate of Determination for our Series E Shares prohibits us from issuing any shares having preferences that are superior to or on parity with our Series E Shares and the Investor Rights Agreement with the holders of our Series E Shares require that we obtain the approval of holders representing 66.6% of the Series E Shares to incur any additional indebtedness, other than commercial bank debt or trade debt.\nThese preferences and restrictions could make it more difficult to raise capital through sales of common stock, a new series of preferred stock or debt without the approval of the holders of our Series E Shares or other preferred shares, who interests may be different than those of our other shareholders who are not entitled to similar preferences or approval rights.\nOur competition has greater resources.\nSeveral of our competitors including, among others, Agilent/Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. There can be no assurance that any products developed by the competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us.\nWe may incur substantial costs enforcing our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings.\nIn connection with the potential enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or disputes related to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting attention and energies of management and key technical personnel, and by increasing our costs of doing business. Additionally, we may not prevail in any future litigation and disputes, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. Staffing due to the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups can be expensive, divert our attention from executing our business plan and could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, possible shortages of key personnel, including engineers, in the area surrounding our facilities could require us to pay more to hire and retain key personnel, thereby increasing our costs.\nIf we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our IT systems, our business, reputation, and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on an internal IT system monitored by certain internal employees and third-party service providers to maintain our IT systems; maintain financial records; retain sensitive data, such as intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to customers, and suppliers; process orders; manage inventory; process shipments to customers; and operate other critical functions. The ongoing maintenance and security of this information is critical to the classified processing and control standards that our suppliers require us to maintain and the success of our business operations and our strategic goals.\nDespite our implementation of network security measures, our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. Our network security measures include, but are not limited to, the implementation of firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups, offsite storage, network audits, and routine updates and modifications. Despite our efforts to create these security barriers, we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition, and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful.\nIn addition, our IT systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Such events could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime, along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to our customers, suppliers and business partners. To the extent that such disruptions occur, our customers and suppliers may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition.\nBusiness interruptions could delay or prevent our business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur primary facility and headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to other natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations that may be beyond our control. We do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows, and success as an overall business.", "PERMNO": 39029, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "GIGA"}
