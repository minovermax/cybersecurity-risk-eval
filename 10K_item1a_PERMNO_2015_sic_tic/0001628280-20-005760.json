{"cik": "926423", "company": "MITCHAM INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K. The risk factors described below are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by additional factors that are not currently known to us, that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nYou should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements included under \u201cCautionary Statements About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d of this Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern could impact our ability to obtain capital financing and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe Company has a history of losses, has had negative cash from operating activities in the last two years and may not have access to sources of capital that were available in prior periods. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in oil prices subsequent to January 31, 2020 have created significant additional uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nA limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues and the loss of one of these customers could harm our results of operations.\nWe typically sell and lease equipment to a relatively small number of customers, the composition of which changes from year to year as leases are initiated and concluded and as customers\u2019 equipment needs vary. Therefore, at any one time, a large portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of customers. In fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, our single largest customer accounted for approximately 8%, 6% and 14%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Together, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 28% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020. There has been consolidation among certain of our customers and this trend may continue. This consolidation could result in the loss of one or more of our customers and could result in a decrease in the demand for our equipment. The loss of any one of our largest customers or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe financial soundness of our customers could materially affect our business and operating results.\nIf our customers experience financial difficulties or their own customers delay payment to them, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us. Disruptions in the financial markets or other macro-economic issues, such as volatility in price of oil or other hydrocarbons or worldwide pandemic, such as COVID-19, could exacerbate financial difficulties for our customers. Any inability of customers to pay us for services could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of January 31, 2020, we had approximately $16.0 million of gross customer accounts receivable, of which approximately $4.8 million was over 180 days past due. Our allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.1 million is substantially related to accounts that are over 180 days past due. For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had net charges of approximately $2.0 million, $200,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, to our provision for doubtful accounts. Significant payment defaults by our customers in excess of the allowance would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe derive a substantial amount of our revenues from foreign operations and sales, which pose additional risks including economic, political and other uncertainties.\nWe conduct operations on a global scale. Our international operations include locations in Canada, Columbia, Hungary, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and Singapore. For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 84%, 85%, and 76%, respectively, of our revenues were attributable to operations in foreign countries.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent to any business operating in foreign countries, and especially those with emerging markets. As we continue to increase our presence in such countries, our operations will encounter the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\ngovernment instability, which can cause investment in capital projects by our potential clients to be withdrawn or delayed, reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services;\n\u2022\npotential expropriation, seizure, nationalization or detention of assets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency;\n\u2022\nimport/export quotas and evolving export license requirements;\n\u2022\ncivil uprisings, riots and war, which can make it unsafe to continue operations, adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses;\n\u2022\navailability of suitable personnel and equipment, which can be affected by government policy, or changes in policy, which limit the importation of qualified crewmembers or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient;\n\u2022\ndecrees, laws, regulations, interpretation and court decisions under legal systems, which are not always fully developed, and which may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and/or unrecoverable costs as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks, including kidnappings of our personnel or those of our customers;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic uncertainties in certain countries which cause delays or cancellation of projects;\n\u2022\nthe United States or foreign countries could enact legislation or impose regulations or other restrictions, including unfavorable labor regulations, tax policies, tariffs, trade restrictions, or economic sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in or expatriate profits from the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nenvironmental conditions and regulatory controls or initiatives in some countries that may impose additional or more stringent requirements than found in the United States and which may not be consistently applied or enforced; and\n\u2022\nregulations, laws or emergency measures taken or imposed by the United States or foreign state and local governments and municipalities in response to emergency or crisis situations, including natural disasters or pandemics, such as COVID-19, which could have an adverse effect on our business, our customers or our operations.\nWe cannot predict the nature and the likelihood of any such events. However, if any of these or other similar events should occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with conducting business internationally, including failure to comply with United States laws that apply to international operations.\nSome of our products are subject to export control regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\u201cDDTC\u201d) and the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d). We are also subject to foreign assets control and economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), which restrict or prohibit our ability to transact with certain foreign countries, individuals and entities. Under these regulations, the sale or transfer of certain equipment to a location outside the United States may require prior approval in the form of an export license issued by the BIS or DDTC. Some potential international transactions may also be restricted or prohibited based on the location, nationality or identity of the potential end user, customer or other parties to the transaction or may require prior authorization in the form of an OFAC license. Any delay in obtaining required governmental approvals could affect our ability to conclude a sale or timely commence a project, and the failure to comply with all such controls could result in criminal and/or civil penalties, including fines, imprisonment, denial of export privileges and debarment from contracting with the federal government. These international transactions may otherwise be subject to tariffs and import/export restrictions from the United States or other governments.\nWe are subject to taxation in many foreign jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide. Our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities, and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest.\nOur overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nDue to the international scope of our business activities, our results of operations may be significantly affected by currency fluctuations.\nWe operate on a global scale and while the majority of our foreign revenues are contracted in U.S. dollars, locally sourced items and expenditures are predominately conducted in local currency. These costs are subject to the risk of taxation policies, expropriation, political turmoil, civil disturbances, armed hostilities, and other geopolitical hazards as well as foreign currency exchange controls (in which payment could not be made in U.S. dollars) and fluctuations.\nFor accounting purposes, balance sheet accounts of our operating subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period. Statement of operations items are translated at average currency exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income within shareholders\u2019 equity. This translation adjustment has in the past been, and may in the future be, material because of the significant amount of assets held by our international subsidiaries and the fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates. However, the sale of our Russian and Australian entities in fiscal 2019 and 2020, respectively, has reduced our exposure to currency fluctuations. The majority of our operating subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency for accounting purposes.\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), including the subsequent exchange rate fluctuations and political and economic uncertainties, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, a post-Brexit transition period started on January 31, 2020 and will end on December 31, 2020 unless extended (the \u201ctransition period\u201d). The transition period, however, can be extended for up to one or two years in a one-off decision made by the joint United Kingdom and European Union committee before June 30, 2020. Significant change is expected at the end of the transition period, even if a comprehensive future United Kingdom and European Union relationship is concluded within the transition period. Further, negotiations on the United Kingdom and European Union relationship are likely to continue after the end of the transition period. The consequences of Brexit and the negotiations that the United Kingdom is currently undertaking with other countries with a view to replicating (where possible) the effects of the European Union\u2019s international trade agreements, which the United Kingdom will no longer benefit from, together with the protracted negotiations around the terms of Brexit, could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets and adversely impact the regions in which we and our clients operate. For example, our Seamap facility in the United Kingdom could be subject to higher costs and delays, which could cause disruptions in our delivery schedules to our customers. In the long term, Brexit could also create uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our customers are subject and lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the United\nKingdom government determines which European Union laws to modify or replace. Continued adverse consequences, such as deterioration in economic conditions and volatility in currency exchange rates, and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the intellectual property of our Marine Technology Products segment.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners to protect our proprietary information, and control access to and distribution of our design information, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent infringement of our patents, copyrights, and trademarks or wrongful misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology. In addition, for technology that is not covered by a patent, these measures will not prevent competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. The laws of many foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and potential adverse decisions by judicial or administrative bodies in foreign countries could impact our international businesses. Failure to protect proprietary information could result in, among other things, loss of competitive advantage, loss of customer orders and decreased revenues.\nAlthough we believe that we have appropriate procedures and safeguards to help ensure that we do not violate a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may unknowingly and inadvertently take action that is inconsistent with a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Consequently, we may be subject to litigation and may be required to defend against claimed infringements of the rights of third parties or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties. Any such litigation could be time consuming, costly and divert management\u2019s attention from operations. In addition, adverse determinations in such litigation could, among other things:\n\u2022\nresult in the loss of our proprietary rights to use the technology;\n\u2022\nsubject us to significant liabilities;\n\u2022\nrequire us to seek licenses from third parties;\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign the products that use the technology; and\n\u2022\nprevent us from manufacturing or selling our products that incorporate the technology.\nIf we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions, our business may be materially adversely affected. Any litigation to protect our intellectual property or to defend ourselves against the claims of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and may not ultimately be successful.\nProducts we develop, manufacture and sell may be subject to performance or reliability risks.\nThe production of new products with high technology content involves occasional problems while the technology and manufacturing methods mature. If significant reliability or quality problems develop, including those due to faulty components, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including:\n\u2022\ncosts associated with reworking the manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nhigh service and warranty expenses;\n\u2022\nhigh inventory obsolescence expense;\n\u2022\nhigh levels of product returns;\n\u2022\ndelays in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nreduced orders from existing customers; and\n\u2022\ndeclining interest from potential customers.\nAlthough we maintain accruals for product warranties as we deem necessary, actual costs could exceed these amounts. From time to time, there may be interruptions or delays in the activation of products at a customer\u2019s site. These interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from aspects of the installation and activation activities, some of which are outside our control. If we experience significant interruptions or delays that cannot be promptly resolved, confidence in our products could be undermined, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe may not be successful in implementing and maintaining technology and product development and enhancements. New technology and product developments may cause us to become less competitive.\nNew seismic data acquisition and sonar technologies may be developed. New and enhanced products and services introduced by a competitor may gain market acceptance and, if not available to us, may adversely affect us. If we choose the wrong technology, or if our\ncompetitors select a superior technology, we could lose our existing customers and be unable to attract new customers, which would harm our business and operations.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by changing technology and new product introductions. Our business could suffer from unexpected developments in technology, from our failure to adapt to these changes or from necessary capital expenditures to respond to technological introductions or obsolescence. In addition, the preferences and requirements of customers can change rapidly.\nOur business exposes us to various technological risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ntechnology obsolescence;\n\u2022\nrequired capital expenditures on new technology;\n\u2022\ndependence upon continued growth of the market for marine seismic data equipment; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties inherent in forecasting advancements in technologies.\nOur inability to develop and implement new technologies or products on a timely basis and at competitive cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to the availability and reliability of component parts used in the manufacture of our products.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for some components of our products, as well as for equipment used to design and test our products. Certain components used in our products may be available from a sole source or limited number of vendors. If these suppliers were to limit or reduce the sale of such components to us, or if these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or other problems that prevented them from supplying us with the necessary components, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These sole source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and performance issues, materials shortages, excess demand, reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us; thereby adversely affecting our business and customer relationships. Some of the sole source and limited source vendors are companies who, from time to time, may allocate parts to equipment manufacturers due to market demand for components and equipment. We have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements. Many of our competitors are much larger and may be able to obtain priority allocations from these shared vendors, thereby limiting or making our sources of supply unreliable for these components. If our supply arrangements are interrupted, there can be no assurance that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely or satisfactory basis. Any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenues.\nIf we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from alternative sources, reduced supplies and higher prices of components will significantly limit our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to customers. A delay in receiving certain components or the inability to receive certain components could harm our customer relationships and our results of operations.\nFailures of components affect the reliability and performance of our products, can reduce customer confidence in our products, and may adversely affect our financial performance. From time to time, we may experience delays in receipt of components and may receive components that do not perform according to their specifications. Any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could harm our business. In addition, a consolidation among suppliers of these components or adverse developments in their businesses that affect their ability to meet our supply demands could adversely impact the availability of components that we depend on. Delayed deliveries from these sources could adversely affect our business.\nIncreases in tariffs, trade restrictions, or taxes on our supplies and products could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe purchase a portion of our supplies from suppliers in China and other foreign countries. The commerce we conduct in the international marketplace makes us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the supplies that we purchase, and the products we ship, cross international borders. Trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as those between the United States and Canada, Mexico and other countries have been escalating in recent years. Trade tensions have led to a series of tariffs imposed by the United States on imports from China, as well as retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on imports from the United States. We believe that certain supplies we purchase from China and other international suppliers could become subject to tariffs that could increase our operation costs. Products we sell into certain foreign markets could also become subject to similar retaliatory tariffs, making the products we sell uncompetitive to similar products not subjected to such import tariffs. Further changes in United States trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers or restrictions, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nWe are subject to risks related to maintaining appropriate inventory levels.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to effectively maintaining inventory levels. Changes in product demand, product pricing, defective components and other factors can impact the appropriate level of inventories. We attempt to accurately predict these trends in order to avoid shortages, excesses or obsolete inventory. However, any of the factors above may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations.\nIndividual orders for many of our products can be relatively significant and delivery requirements can be sporadic. Accordingly, our operating results for a particular quarter can be materially impacted by the absence or presence of such significant orders.\nThese periodic fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe face competition for our products and services.\nWe have several competitors who provide similar products and services, many of which have substantially greater financial resources than our own. There are also several smaller competitors that, in the aggregate, generate significant revenues from the sale or lease of products similar to those we offer. Some competitors may offer a broader range of instruments and equipment for sale or lease than we do and may offer financing arrangements to customers on terms that we may not be able to match. In addition, new competitors may enter the market and competition could intensify. We cannot assure you that revenue from our products will continue at current volumes or prices if current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products with better features, performance, price or other characteristics than our products. Competitive pressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The advancement of seismic technology having a significant competitive advantage over the equipment in our rental fleet could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably lease and/or sell this equipment.\nWe rely on a small number of suppliers and disruption in vendor supplies could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe purchase many of the components used in our manufacturing operations and the majority of our seismic equipment for our lease pool from a small number of suppliers. Should our relationships with our suppliers deteriorate, we may have difficulty in obtaining new technology required by our customers and maintaining our existing equipment in accordance with manufacturers\u2019 specifications. In addition, we may, from time to time, experience supply or quality control problems with suppliers, and these problems could significantly affect our ability to meet our lease commitments. Also, our suppliers could experience significant cash flow issues or otherwise be negatively impacted by current or future global economic conditions. Please read risk factor \u201cWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the recent spread of COVID-19 or novel coronavirus, or fear of such an event\u201d below for a discussion of recent disruptions relating to the recent outbreak of COVID-19. Reliance on certain suppliers, as well as industry supply conditions, generally involve several risks, including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key products and increases in product costs and reduced control over delivery schedules; any of these events could adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe rely on contractors and subcontractors for certain projects, which could affect our results of operations and reputation.\nWe may rely on contractors and subcontractors to complete certain projects. The quality and timing of production and services by our contractors and subcontractors is not totally under our control. Reliance on contractors and subcontractors gives us less control over a project and exposes us to significant risks, including late delivery, substandard quality and high costs. The failure of our contractors or subcontractors to deliver quality products or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our profitability and reputation.\nDemand for seismic data is not assured.\nDemand for certain of our products and services depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, production and development activities, as well as on the number of crews conducting land, transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition worldwide. The levels of such spending are influenced by:\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer demand;\n\u2022\nsupplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe effect of worldwide energy conservation measures;\n\u2022\nthe ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels;\n\u2022\noil and gas prices and industry expectations of future price levels;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe availability of current geophysical data;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain capital for exploration operations;\n\u2022\nthe granting of leases or exploration concessions and the expiration of such rights;\n\u2022\nchanges to existing laws and regulations, including legal requirements relating to the environment;\n\u2022\npandemics, such as the worldwide COVID-19 or coronavirus outbreak beginning in early 2020, which could impact economic conditions;\n\u2022\nshareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and gas and related infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign tax policies;\n\u2022\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers;\n\u2022\nexpected rates of declining current production;\n\u2022\ntechnical advances affecting energy exploration, production, transportation and consumption;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including hurricanes and monsoons that can affect oil and gas operations over a wide area as well as less severe inclement weather that can preclude or delay seismic acquisition surveys;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nprices and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\nlocal and international political and economic conditions.\nThe cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry can have a significant effect on our revenues and profitability. Historically, oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of exploration and developmental activity, have fluctuated significantly. During periods of improved energy commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which results in increased demand for our products. Conversely, in periods when these energy commodity prices deteriorate, capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to contract and the demand for our products generally weakens. These fluctuations have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our business. Slowdowns in economic activity would likely reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in an extended period of lower crude oil and natural gas prices. We are unable to predict future oil and natural gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity. A prolonged low level of activity in the oil and gas industry will likely depress exploration and development activity, adversely affecting the demand for our products and services and our financial condition and results of operations.\nEquipment that we lease to our customers is sometimes located in foreign countries where retrieval of the equipment after the termination of the rental agreement is difficult or impossible if the customer does not return the equipment or comply with contractual obligations to reimburse us for lost equipment. The costs associated with retrieving this equipment or the loss of equipment that is not retrieved could be significant and could adversely affect our operations and earnings.\nFuel conservation measures could reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which would in turn reduce the demand for our products and services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation, and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal and biofuels) could reduce demand for our products and services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues.\nOur revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in a given financial period.\nProjects awarded to and scheduled by our customers can be delayed or canceled due to factors that are outside of their control, which can affect the demand for our products and services. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\ninclement weather conditions, natural disasters or pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 outbreak;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining permits and licenses;\n\u2022\nlabor or political unrest;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining access rights;\n\u2022\navailability of required equipment;\n\u2022\nsecurity concerns;\n\u2022\nbudgetary or financial issues: and\n\u2022\ndelays in payments to our customers from their clients.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the recent spread of COVID-19 or novel coronavirus, or fear of such an event.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a COVID-19. The spread of COVID-19 is currently impacting countries and communities where we have facilities and employees, as well as those where our suppliers and customers have operations. We are monitoring the outbreak of COVID-19 and taking certain steps deemed necessary to mitigate risks to us, our employees, business associates and communities. To date, the spread of COVID-19 has not had a material impact on Mitcham. However, on March 18, 2020, our facility in Malaysia was closed for a period mandated by the Malaysian government through at least April 30, 2020. On April 6, 2020 the Singaporean government imposed a similar closure of our facility in Singapore through at least April 30, 2020. We cannot predict whether there will be additional closures at any of our facilities, including an extension of the closures mandated by the Malaysian and Singaporean governments, or other interruptions or impact to our business activities from the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, our reliance on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers, and service providers exposes us to possibility of further delay or interruption of our operations. We are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of COVID-19, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in the countries and communities where we, our suppliers, or our customers have operations. If there are extended or additional facility closures, or other interruptions to our business, including as a result of impact on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers and service providers, related to the spread of COVID-19, such disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCapital requirements for our business strategy can be large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage or execute our strategy.\nWe have historically funded our capital requirements with cash generated from operations, cash reserves, issuance of preferred and common stock and short-term borrowings from commercial banks. Our capital requirements may continue to increase. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, or current demand or pricing of our services were to decrease substantially or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. Access to global financial markets and the terms under which capital is available can be uncertain and volatile. Furthermore, due to the historically cyclical nature of the energy business in general, and the seismic industry in particular, capital for businesses in this industry can be even more difficult and expensive to obtain.\nThrough January 31, 2020, we have issued 994,046 shares of 9.00% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). The 994,046 shares represent 100% of the Series A Preferred Stock available for sale through our at-the-market program. In addition, we have limited authorized capital of preferred stock remaining available for issuance. As of January 31, 2020, under our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, we had 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. We cannot predict the availability, size or price of any future issuances of preferred or common stock or other instruments convertible into equity, and the effect, if any, that such future issuances and sales will have on the market price of our securities. Any additional issuances of preferred or common stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, such stock may ultimately result in dilution to the holders of stock, dilution in our future earnings per share and may have a material adverse effect upon the market price of the stock of the Company.\nDue to these factors, we cannot be certain that funding will be available if and when needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to grow our existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccess to working capital and letters of credit may be limited.\nFrom time to time, we may require access to working capital to meet overhead costs and operational expenditures, finance inventory purchases, to provide letters of credit or bankers\u2019 guarantees to certain customers. Historically, we have met this need by utilizing a revolving credit facility. In March 2017, we terminated our revolving Credit Agreement (as defined below) and have not replaced that facility. There is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate a replacement facility or facilities. Many commercial banks in the United States have undertaken to reduce their exposure to companies engaged in oil and gas related activities, which further limits our ability to obtain working capital financing. Should we not have access to adequate working capital financing, we may not be able to pursue or complete some business opportunities or maintain and appropriate level of working capital to meet our overhead costs and operational expenditures. Further, our failure to meet our projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows could lead to cash flow and working capital constraints that could limit our ability to meet day-to-day needs of our business. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our operations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, or seek additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to generate or access working capital could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nOur success is dependent on, among other things, our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain the services of certain key personnel. In September of 2015, Robert P. Capps, Executive Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer, and Guy Malden, Executive Vice President-Marine Systems, assumed the additional roles of Co-Chief Executive Officers. In these roles, Mr. Capps and Mr. Malden are responsible for all day-to-day operations in close coordination with the Board of Directors. The loss of the services of Mr. Capps or Mr.\nMalden for an extended period of time or the inability to recruit, train and retain other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe high fixed costs of our equipment leasing operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur equipment leasing business has high fixed costs. In periods of significant downtime these fixed costs do not decline as rapidly as our revenues. As a result, any significant downtime or low activity caused by reduced demand could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur long-lived assets may be subject to impairment.\nWe periodically assess our long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets and our lease pool of equipment, for impairment. If we expect significant sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices in the future, we may be required to write down the value of our long-lived assets if the future cash flows anticipated to be generated from these assets falls below net book value. Declines in oil and natural gas prices, if sustained, could result in future impairments. If we are forced to write down the value of our long-lived assets, these noncash asset impairments could negatively affect our results of operations in the period in which they are recorded. In fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2018 we recognized charges for impairment of approximately $760,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, related to certain intangible assets. See the discussion included in Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Long-Lived Assets.\u201d\nEnactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES\u201d Act) and final regulations relating to and interpretations of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) may vary from our current interpretation of such legislation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States federal income tax legislation enacted (i) on March 27, 2020, commonly referred to as the CARES Act, and (ii) on December 22, 2017, commonly referred to as the TCJA, are highly complex and subject to interpretation. The presentation of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in both the CARES Act and the TCJA. In the future, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service could issue final regulations and additional interpretive guidance with respect to the provisions of the CARES Act and TCJA. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such provisions from any future final regulations or interpretive guidance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery statutes, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (the \u201cUK Bribery Act\u201d), could result in fines, criminal penalties, and other sanctions, and may adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe FCPA and the UK Bribery Act, and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We and our local partners operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. If we are found to be liable for violations under the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or other similar laws, either due to our acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others, including our local or strategic partners, we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, investors could negatively view potential violations, inquiries or allegations of misconduct under the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or similar laws, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares. We also may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or using other methods that U.S. law and regulations prohibit us from using.\nWe could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions or the seizure of assets. We could face other third party claims by agents, shareholders, debt holders, or other interest holders or constituents of our company. Further, disclosure of the subject matter of any investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business from potential customers or retain existing business from our current customers, to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets. Our customers in relevant jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests, and we may be required to dedicate significant time and resources to investigate and resolve allegations of misconduct, regardless of the merit of such allegations.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations that could increase our costs of compliance and impose significant liabilities.\nWe are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations both in the United States and in foreign countries relating to worker safety and health, protection of the environment and natural resources, and the handling of chemicals and materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as the recycling and disposal of wastes generated by those processes. For additional information regarding costs and liabilities associated with environmental or worker safety and health matters, see Item 1 - \u201cRegulation - Environmental Regulation.\u201d Compliance with or continuing to be subject to these applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations. In addition, increased environmental regulation of oil and gas exploration and production activities, whether in the United States or in any of the other countries in which our customers operate could cause them to incur increased costs or restrict, delay or cancel drilling, exploration or production programs or associated hydraulic fracturing activities, which in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUse of our equipment in marine environments may be regulated or require a permit or other authorization from United States or foreign governmental agencies. The implementation of new or more restrictive laws or regulatory requirements to protect marine species, or the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered, could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products or services.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in reduced demand for oil and natural gas, thereby adversely affecting our business, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our manufacturing of equipment and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn the United States, the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), in addition to some state and regional authorities, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislation, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the U.S. Clean Air Act and may require the installation of \u201cbest available control technology\u201d to limit emissions of GHGs from certain new or significantly modified facilities emitting large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants. In addition, the EPA has adopted regulations requiring monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources, including, among others, certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities. In 2016, the EPA finalized new regulations that set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities, known as New Source Performance Standards Subpart OOOOa. Also, many of the other countries where we and our customers operate, including Canada and various countries in Europe, have adopted or are considering GHG reduction measures similar to those described above. Such measures, or any similar future proposals, have the potential to increase costs for the oil and gas industry, which in turn could result in reduced demand for the products and services we provide. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations or other initiatives that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws, regulations or other legal requirements imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from oil and gas exploration and production activities could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and services.\nFinally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, hurricanes, floods and other climatic events. If any such climatic events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and operations of our customers. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct and protect our business. As a result, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the security of our facilities, and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nCybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, disruption of our customers\u2019 operations, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as advanced persistent threats, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches. Although we have taken measures to prevent cybersecurity attacks and respond to cyber incidents, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent or recover from cyberattacks or information security breaches. Although we maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, increased protection costs, regulatory action or potential liability.\nOur business could be negatively affected by data protection and privacy laws that carry fines and may expose us to criminal sanctions and civil suits.\nSeveral jurisdictions in which we operate (including certain U.S. states, Europe and Canada) may have laws governing how we must respond to a cyber incident that results in the unauthorized access, disclosure or loss of personal data. Additionally, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including international comprehensive data privacy regulations such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and recent California legislation (which, among other things, provides for a private right of action), pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and could potentially elevate our costs over time. Although our business does not involve large-scale processing of personal information, our business involves collection, uses and other processing of personal data of our employees, contractors, suppliers and service providers. As legislation continues to develop and cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend significant resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures to comply with such legislation and to detect, investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cyber incidents. Any failure by us, or a company we acquire, to comply with such laws and regulations could result in reputational harm, loss of goodwill, penalties, liabilities and/or mandated changes in our business practices.\nWe may grow through acquisitions and our failure to properly plan and manage those acquisitions may adversely affect our performance.\nWe plan to expand not only through organic growth but may also do so through the strategic acquisition of companies and assets. We must plan and manage any acquisitions effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. If we fail to manage acquisitions effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, significant demands on our personnel, management and other resources. We must continue to improve our operational, financial, management, legal compliance and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business.\nAny future acquisitions could present a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities;\n\u2022\nincreased competition for acquisition opportunities, in turn increasing our cost of making further acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making additional acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nour inability to secure sufficient financing, on terms we find acceptable, that may be required for any such acquisition or investment.\nEncountering any of these or any unforeseen problems in completing acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete, financial condition and results of operations, and could prevent us from achieving the increases in revenues and profitability that we hope to realize through acquisitions.\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nEnergy and energy service company stock prices, including our stock price, have been volatile from time to time. Stock price volatility could adversely affect our business operations by, among other things, impeding our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to obtain additional financing.\nIn addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nfactors influencing the levels of global oil and natural gas exploration and exploitation activities, such as depressed prices for natural gas in North America or disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010;\n\u2022\nthe operating and securities price performance of companies that investors or analysts consider comparable to us;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets.\nIn March 2020, as a result of multiple significant factors impacting supply and demand in the global oil and natural gas markets, including the announced price reductions and production increases by members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations, the price for oil declined sharply and may continue to decline. Oil and natural gas commodity prices are expected to continue to be volatile. In addition, a slowing or changing economy as a result of the recent COVID-19 outbreak may further depress financial markets and have a negative impact\non the price of our common stock. We cannot predict the duration or effects of these recent developments, but if the prices of oil and natural gas continue to decline or remain low for a lengthy period, or if general macroeconomic conditions worsen or remain depressed for an extended period, the price of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nTo the extent that the price of our common stock remains at lower levels or it declines further, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration will be reduced. In addition, increases in our leverage may make it more difficult for us to access additional capital. These factors may limit our ability to implement our operating and growth plans\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), which could have a material adverse effect on us and our shareholders.\nThe standards for continued listing on NASDAQ include, among other things, that the minimum bid price for the listed securities not fall below $1.00 for a period in excess of thirty consecutive business days. Our common stock has recently traded at levels below $1.00 per share. If the closing bid price of our common stock were to fail to meet NASDAQ\u2019s minimum closing bid price requirement, or if we otherwise fail to meet any other applicable requirements of NASDAQ and we are unable to regain compliance, NASDAQ may make a determination to delist our common stock. The delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ could negatively impact us by (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) impacting our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing or limiting us from accessing the public capital markets; and (iv) impairing our ability to provide equity incentives to our employees.\nBecause we do not currently pay any dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings attributable to our common stock to support our operations and growth. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available, our financial condition, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe may issue debt or equity securities with rights senior to that of our common stock in liquidation which could dilute or negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nThrough January 31, 2020, we have issued 994,046 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. The 994,046 shares represent 100% of the Series A Preferred Stock available for sale through our at-the-market program. The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference senior to that of our common stock. In order to raise additional capital, in the future, we may issue other debt securities or equity securities with a liquidation preference senior to that of our common stock. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities could receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of these securities could dilute or negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Texas law could discourage a takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares for a premium.\nProvisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Texas Business Organizations Code may tend to delay, defer or prevent a potential unsolicited offer or takeover attempt that is not approved by our Board of Directors but that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interest, including an attempt that might result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares. To the extent that there are authorized, unissued shares, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with preferences and rights as it determines, which may afford the holders of any series of preferred stock preferences, rights or voting powers superior to those of the holders of common stock.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our financial results.\nIt is management\u2019s responsibility to establish and maintain effective internal control in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the financial reporting soundness for external purposes. Internal control over financial reporting is not intended to impart absolute assurance that the Company can prevent or detect misstatements of its financial statement or fraud due to its inherent limitations.\nAs of January 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s executive officers determined that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to an identified material weakness. The material weakness involved the Company\u2019s review controls over significant estimates. The Company failed to detect an error related to our provision for doubtful accounts identified by the Company\u2019s auditors during the audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If the current material weakness is not remediated, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and the Company could be required to restate its financial results. The failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Company\u2019s ability to report its financial results accurately and in a timely manner or to detect and prevent fraud and could also cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. See further discussion of the material weakness, including the Company's planned remediation procedures, in Item 9A.- \"Controls and Procedures.\"", "PERMNO": 81165, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "MIND"}
