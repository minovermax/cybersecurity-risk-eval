{"cik": "1609253", "company": "California Resources Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRISK FACTORS\nDescribed below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected materially and adversely by other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial.\nPrices for our products can fluctuate widely and an extended period of low prices could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to invest in our assets.\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to invest in our assets are highly dependent on oil, natural gas and NGL prices. A sustained period of low prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs would reduce our cash flows from operations and could reduce our borrowing capacity or cause a default under our financing agreements. Under these conditions, if we were unable to improve liquidity through additional financing, asset monetizations, restructuring of our debt obligations, equity issuances or otherwise, cash flow from operations and expected available credit capacity could be insufficient to meet our commitments. Successfully completing these actions could have significant adverse effects such as higher operating and financing costs, dilution of equity and further covenant restrictions. Past refinancing activities have resulted in increases in our annual interest expense and future refinancing activities may have the same or greater effect.\nHistorically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be so. We are particularly dependent on Brent crude prices that have been as low as $27.88 per barrel and as high as $115.19 per barrel during the period between 2014 and 2019. Factors affecting these commodity prices include:\n\u2022\nchanges in domestic and global supply and demand;\n\u2022\ndomestic and global inventory levels;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe actions of OPEC and other significant producers and governments;\n\u2022\nchanges or disruptions in actual or anticipated production, refining and processing;\n\u2022\nworldwide drilling and exploration activities;\n\u2022\ngovernment energy policies and regulation, including with respect to climate change;\n\u2022\nthe effects of conservation;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and other seasonal impacts;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading in derivative contracts;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances;\n\u2022\ntransportation and storage capacity, bottlenecks and costs in producing areas;\n\u2022\nthe price, availability and acceptance of alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nregional market conditions; and\n\u2022\nother matters affecting the supply and demand dynamics for these products.\nLower prices could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, including:\n\u2022\nreducing our proved oil and natural gas reserves over time, including as a result of impairments of existing reserves;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to grow or maintain future production including a delay in the reversion dates of certain of our JVs;\n\u2022\ncausing a reduction in our borrowing base under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, which could affect our liquidity;\n\u2022\nreducing our ability to make interest payments or maintain compliance with financial covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, which could trigger mandatory loan repayments and default and foreclosure by our lenders and bondholders against our assets;\n\u2022\nforcing monetization events of certain assets under one of our JV arrangements;\n\u2022\naffecting our ability to attract counterparties and enter into commercial transactions, including hedging, surety or insurance transactions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our access to funds through the capital markets and the price we could obtain for asset sales or other monetization transactions of our equity and debt securities.\nOur hedging program does not provide downside protection for all of our production in 2020 and beyond. As a result, our hedges do not fully protect us from commodity price declines, and we may be unable to enter into acceptable additional hedges in the future.\nOur lenders could limit our borrowing capabilities and restrict our ability to use or access capital.\nOur 2014 Revolving Credit Facility is an important source of our liquidity. Our ability to borrow under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility is limited by our borrowing base, the size of our lenders' commitments and our ability to comply with covenants, including a minimum month-end liquidity requirement of $150 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $317 million of available borrowing capacity, before taking into account the minimum month-end liquidity requirement.\nThe borrowing base under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility is redetermined semi-annually on May 1 and November 1. Our lenders determine our borrowing base by reference to the value of our reserves and other factors that the administrative agent may deem appropriate in good faith in accordance with its usual and customary oil and gas lending criteria as they exist at the particular time. The lenders under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility may also factor other liabilities, including our other indebtedness, into the determination of our borrowing base. Currently, our borrowing base is set at $2.3 billion and the lenders' aggregate commitment under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility is $1 billion. However, the $1.3 billion outstanding under our 2017 Credit Agreement is taken into account in limiting the amount of such commitment. Thus, any reduction in our borrowing base would have the effect of reducing capacity under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. Any such reduction requires the consent and approval of the lenders holding 66 2/3% of the commitments under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe have informed the Administrative Agent under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility of the proposed exchange offers described in our Form 8-K filed on February 21, 2020 and discussions are ongoing. Initially, the Administrative Agent expressed its own view that consummation of the exchange transactions may present material concerns to our first lien lenders, including lenders under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility who could seek a significant reduction in our borrowing base on or before our next scheduled borrowing base redetermination. We have not received similar communications from other large lenders in our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, some of which are dealer managers in the proposed exchange offers. Our more recent discussions with the Administrative Agent have focused on our need to address the debt maturities in 2021 and 2022, the subsequent steps that we plan to take to address refinancing these debt maturities and that the transactions described herein are a first step toward that objective. The Administrative Agent has indicated that if we address these maturities before the next redetermination date, a more muted response from the first lien lenders may be possible. The Administrative Agent did note, however, that many considerations will go into the ultimate decision by the lenders under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and the weight of those considerations may vary given conditions of both the lending market and the general upstream industry at the time.\nWe cannot assure you that the lenders under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility will not reduce our borrowing base by a material amount as a result of the proposed exchange offers or otherwise. Any reduction in our $2.3 billion borrowing base would only have the effect of reducing the commitment under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility by up to $100 million unless the borrowing base reduction exceeded $1.4 billion, at which point the reduction and loss of availability would be dollar for dollar. Any reduction in our borrowing base could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and may hinder our ability to execute on our development plan. We would seek to reduce our capital program and expenses and potentially monetize assets among other things to address tighter liquidity constraints. However, there can be no assurances that such actions will be possible or adequate to address such a reduction in our borrowing base. If the reduction in our borrowing base were sufficiently severe that we were unable to maintain adequate liquidity to conduct operations and meet our obligations, we could ultimately be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.\nThe financial covenants that we must satisfy under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility include a month-end minimum liquidity test, certain financial ratios that measure our leverage and fixed interest charges on a quarterly basis, and the present value of our reserves on a semi-annual basis. These covenants could limit our ability to borrow under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility or obtain additional financing through the capital markets or\notherwise. Certain other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness also include financial ratios that are generally less restrictive than our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility.\nIf we were to breach any of the covenants under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility or any of our other credit agreements or indentures, the lenders under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility would be permitted to cease lending under the facility, accelerate the repayment of the outstanding amounts due and foreclose against the assets securing them.\nFor a further description of our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and our other credit agreements, see Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Agreements.\nWe have significant indebtedness that could limit our financial and operating flexibility and make us more vulnerable in economic downturns.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the face value of our outstanding long-term consolidated indebtedness was $4.98 billion. Our financing agreements permit us to incur significant additional indebtedness as well as certain other obligations. In addition, we may seek amendments or waivers from our existing lenders and bondholders to the extent we need to incur indebtedness above amounts currently permitted by our financing agreements.\nOur level of indebtedness may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations, including:\n\u2022\njeopardizing our ability to execute our business plans;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in economic and industry conditions related to our business;\n\u2022\nputting us at a disadvantage against competitors that have lower fixed obligations and more cash flow to devote to their businesses;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain favorable financing for working capital, capital investments and general corporate and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into hedging contracts;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund capital investments, react to competitive pressures and engage in certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us;\n\u2022\ndefaulting on a commercial agreement with one of our JVs; and\n\u2022\nfailing to redeem the interests held by one of our JV partners.\nOur financing agreements also include covenants that restrict management's discretion to operate our business in certain circumstances. These restrictions include limitations that could affect our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and grant additional liens;\n\u2022\nrepay junior indebtedness, including our Second Lien Notes and Senior Notes;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into JVs;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nuse the proceeds of asset sales for certain purposes;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers or acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nrelease collateral.\nThese limitations are further described in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Agreements and the documents governing our indebtedness that are filed with the SEC.\nOur financing agreements, including the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, contain customary cross-default mechanisms that provide that an event of default under any one of those agreements may trigger an event of default under all of those agreements. In such an event, we might not be able to obtain alternative financing or, if we are able to obtain such financing, we might not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us, which would negatively affect our ability to implement our business plan, make capital expenditures or finance our operations.\nA significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable rates. Although we have purchased derivative contracts that limit our interest rate exposure for a portion of this indebtedness, a rise in interest rates will increase our interest expense to the extent we do not have interest-rate hedges and could limit our liquidity and our ability to comply with our debt covenants.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other financial needs will depend on our future performance, which is influenced by market, financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. If our cash flow is not sufficient, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or issue additional equity on terms that may be unattractive, if these can be done at all. Failure to make a scheduled payment or to comply with covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default. In addition, any perceived or actual deterioration in our liquidity or credit position could cause our counterparties to require new letters of credit or to increase the amounts covered by existing letters of credit. Any of these factors could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations and a default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of all of our debt and foreclosure against assets constituting collateral for our indebtedness.\nA significant portion of our long-term indebtedness will mature within two years and will likely need to be refinanced. There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.\nApproximately $2 billion of our long-term indebtedness will mature in 2021, including amounts outstanding under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and 2016 Credit Agreement. An additional $1 billion under our 2017 Credit Agreement will mature in October 2021 if more than $100 million is outstanding under our 2016 Credit Agreement at that time. Finally, our Second Lien indenture will require us to make a principal repayment of $287 million in June 2021. Our ability to satisfy these maturities and obligations will likely require us to refinance a large portion of this indebtedness. Our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and credit markets and our financial condition and credit rating. The terms of existing debt instruments may restrict us from pursuing certain refinancing strategies as well as other strategies to reduce indebtedness. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all, and if we are unable to do so we may not be able to satisfy these maturities and obligations as they become due.\nOur stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in losses for our stockholders.\nThe public market for our common stock has been characterized by significant price and volume fluctuations. Our stock price and volume may be affected by our operating results in any period which fail to meet the investment community\u2019s expectations and our stock price has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to our operating performance. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not decline below its current or historic price ranges. These highly volatile market conditions, particularly in the oil and natural gas sector, could result in a stockholder losing a substantial part or all of its investment in our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities litigation has been initiated. Should litigation be initiated against us, whether or not successful, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention, both of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nOur business requires substantial capital investments, which may include acquisitions or JVs. We may be unable to fund these investments which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or production. Our capital investment program is also susceptible to risks that could materially affect its implementation.\nOur exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital investments. Historically, we have funded our capital investments through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and joint ventures. We seek to manage our internally funded capital investments to closely align with projected cash flow from operations. Accordingly, a reduction in projected operating cash flow could cause us to reduce our future capital investments. In general, the ability to execute our capital plan depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce;\n\u2022commodity prices;\n\u2022regulatory and third-party approvals;\n\u2022our ability to timely drill, complete and stimulate wells;\n\u2022our ability to secure equipment, services and personnel; and\n\u2022the availability of external sources of financing.\nAccess to future capital may be limited by our lenders, our JV partners, capital markets constraints, activist funds or investors, or poor stock price performance. Because of these and other potential variables, we may be unable to deploy capital in the manner planned, which may negatively impact our production levels and development activities and limit our ability to make acquisitions or enter into JVs.\nUnless we make sufficient capital investments and conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our ability to make the necessary long-term capital investments or acquisitions needed to maintain or expand our reserves may be impaired to the extent we have insufficient cash flow from operations or liquidity to fund those activities. Over the long term, a continuing decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by reducing our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets.\nEstimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nMany uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and related future net cash flows. Our estimates are based on various assumptions that require significant judgment in the evaluation of available information. Our assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, reservoir data may change over time as more information becomes available from development and appraisal activities.\nOur ability to add reserves, other than through acquisitions, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside management's control and will affect whether the historical sources of proved reserves additions continue to provide reserves at similar levels.\nGenerally, lower prices adversely affect the quantity of our reserves as those reserves expected to be produced in later years, which tend to be costlier on a per unit basis, become uneconomic. In addition, a portion of our proved undeveloped reserves may no longer meet the economic producibility criteria under the applicable rules or may be removed due to a lower amount of capital available to develop these projects within the SEC-mandated five-year limit.\nIn addition, our reserves information represents estimates prepared by internal engineers. Although 80% of our 2019 proved reserve estimates were audited by our independent petroleum engineers, Ryder Scott Company, L.P. and Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., we cannot guarantee that the estimates are accurate. Reserves estimation is a partially subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows from those reserves depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, including:\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from similar areas;\n\u2022\nthe quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices;\n\u2022\nproduction and operating costs;\n\u2022\nad valorem, excise and income taxes;\n\u2022\ndevelopment costs;\n\u2022\nthe effects of government regulations; and\n\u2022\nfuture workover and facilities costs.\nChanges in these variables and assumptions could require us to make significant negative reserves revisions, which could affect our liquidity by reducing the borrowing base under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, factors such as the availability of capital, geology, government regulations and permits, the effectiveness of development plans and other factors could affect the source or quantity of future reserves additions.\nAcquisition and disposition activities and our JVs involve substantial risks.\nOur acquisition activities carry risks that we may:\n\u2022\nnot fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances;\n\u2022\nbear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties;\n\u2022\nexperience share price declines based on the market\u2019s evaluation of the activity;\n\u2022\nassume liabilities that are greater than anticipated; and\n\u2022\nbe exposed to currency, political, marketing, labor and other risks, particularly associated with investments in foreign assets.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due diligence. Successful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing for recovering the reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and incomplete, and we may be unable to make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy.\nIf we are not able to make acquisitions, we may not be able to grow our reserves or develop our properties in a timely manner or at all.\nPart of our business strategy involves entering into JVs and divesting non-core assets. Our JVs and disposition activities carry risks that we may:\n\u2022\nnot be able to realize reasonable prices or rates of return for assets;\n\u2022\nbe required to retain liabilities that are greater than desired or anticipated;\n\u2022\nexperience increased operating costs; and\n\u2022\nreduce our cash flows if we cannot replace associated revenue.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully enter into new JVs or that JVs will occur in the time frames or with economic terms that we expect. We may also be unable to divest assets on financially attractive terms or at all. Our ability to enter into JVs and sell assets is also limited by the agreements governing our indebtedness.\nIf we are not able to sell assets as needed or enter into JVs, we may not be able to generate proceeds to support our liquidity and capital investments.\nOur business is highly regulated and government authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change requirements governing our operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation methods, enhanced production techniques and fluid injection or disposal, that could increase costs, restrict operations and change or delay the implementation of our business plans.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to the exploration and development of our properties, as well as the production, transportation, marketing and sale of our products. Federal, state and local agencies may assert overlapping authority to regulate these areas. For example, the jurisdiction, duties and enforcement authority of various state agencies have significantly increased with respect to oil and natural gas activities in recent years, and these state agencies as well as certain cities and counties have significantly revised their regulations, regulatory interpretations and data collection and reporting requirements and plan to issue additional regulations of certain oil and natural gas activities in 2020. In addition, certain of these federal, state and local laws and regulations may apply retroactively and may impose strict or joint and several liability on us for events or conditions over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nSee Items 1 and 2 - Business and Properties - Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry for a description of laws and regulations that affect our business. To operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state and local government authorities for a variety of activities including siting, drilling, completion, stimulation, operation, inspection, maintenance, transportation, storage, marketing, site remediation, decommissioning, abandonment, fluid injection and disposal and water recycling and reuse. Failure to comply may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal fines and penalties and liability for noncompliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or prohibiting certain operations. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict or joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of contamination, including on properties over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nOur customers, including refineries and utilities, and the businesses that transport our products to customers, are also highly regulated. For example, various government authorities have sought to restrict the use of oil, natural gas or certain petroleum-based products such as fuels and plastics. Federal and state pipeline safety agencies have adopted or proposed regulations to expand their jurisdiction to include more gas and liquid gathering lines and pipelines and to impose additional mechanical integrity, leak detection and reporting requirements. The state has adopted additional regulations on the storage of natural gas that could affect the demand for or availability of such storage, increase seasonal volatility, or otherwise affect the prices we receive from customers. The CPUC has commenced a rulemaking to develop a long-term natural gas planning strategy to ensure safe and reliable gas systems at just and reasonable rates during what it describes as a 25-year transition from natural gas-fueled technologies to meet the state's GHG goals. Certain municipalities have enacted restrictions on the installation of natural gas appliances and infrastructure in new residential or commercial construction, which could affect the retail natural gas market for our utility customers and the demand and prices we receive for the natural gas we produce.\nCosts of compliance may increase and operational delays or restrictions may occur as existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or as new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations, each of which has occurred in the past.\nGovernment authorities and other organizations continue to study health, safety and environmental aspects of oil and natural gas operations, including those related to air, soil and water quality, ground movement or seismicity and natural resources. For example, the Legislature expanded CalGEM's duties in 2019 to include public health and safety and CalGEM is commencing public health and safety workshops in the first quarter of 2020 to be followed by an associated rulemaking process. Government authorities have also adopted or proposed new or more stringent requirements for permitting, inspection and maintenance of wells, pipelines and other facilities, and public disclosure or environmental review of, or restrictions on, oil and natural gas operations, including proposed setback distances from other land uses. Such requirements or associated litigation could result in potentially significant added costs to comply, delay or curtail our exploration, development, fluid injection and disposal or production activities, preclude us from drilling, completing or stimulating wells, or otherwise restrict our ability to access and develop mineral rights, any of which could have an adverse effect on our expected production, other operations and financial condition.\nChanges to elected or appointed officials or their priorities and policies could result in different approaches to the regulation of the oil and natural gas industry. We cannot predict the actions the Governor or Legislature may take with respect to the regulation of our business, the oil and natural gas industry or the state's economic, fiscal or environmental policies.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas carry significant operational and financial risk and uncertainty. We may not drill wells at the times we scheduled, or at all. Wells we do drill may not yield production in economic quantities or generate the expected VCI.\nThe exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties depend in part on our analysis of geophysical, geologic, engineering, production and other technical data and processes, including the interpretation of 3D seismic data. This analysis is often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. We also bear the risks of equipment failures, accidents, environmental hazards, unusual geological formations or unexpected pressure or irregularities within formations, adverse weather conditions, permitting or construction delays, title disputes, surface access disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance (including lack of production response to workovers or improved and enhanced recovery efforts) and other associated risks.\nWe allocate capital by reference to a VCI metric. We calculate the VCI of a well or project at the time capital is allocated and frequently re-calculate the VCI after a well or project is completed. VCI is calculated based on internal estimates of future cash flows and capital investment, which are inherently uncertain. In addition, future cash flows are dependent on our production costs. Our production cost per barrel is higher than that of many of our peers due to the extraction methods we use, the large number of wells we operate and the effects of our PSC-type contracts.\nOur decisions and ultimate profitability are also affected by commodity prices, the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, available transportation and storage capacity, the political environment and other factors. Our cost of drilling, completing, stimulating, equipping, operating, inspecting, maintaining and abandoning wells is also often uncertain.\nAny of the forgoing operational or financial risks could cause actual results to differ materially from the expected VCI or cause a well or project to become uneconomic or less profitable than forecast.\nWe have specifically identified locations for drilling over the next several years, which represent a significant part of our long-term growth strategy. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. We make assumptions about the consistency and accuracy of data when we identify these locations that may prove inaccurate. We cannot guarantee that our identified drilling locations will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, some of our leases could expire if we do not establish production in the leased acreage. The combined net acreage covered by leases expiring in the next three years represented approximately 15% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2019.\nPart of our strategy involves exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. Our drilling results are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline if drilling is unsuccessful.\nThe risk profile for our exploration drilling locations is higher than for other locations because we have less geologic and production data and drilling history, in particular for those exploration drilling locations in unconventional reservoirs, which are in unproven geologic plays. Our ability to profitably drill and develop our identified drilling locations depends on a number of variables, including crude oil and natural gas prices, capital availability, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity and other factors. We may not find commercial amounts of oil or natural gas or the costs of drilling, completing, stimulating and operating wells in these locations may be higher than initially expected. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. In either case, the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and could be impaired.\nOne of our important assets is our acreage in the Monterey shale play in the San Joaquin, Los Angeles and Ventura basins. The geology of the Monterey shale is highly complex and not uniform due to localized and varied faulting and changes in structure and rock characteristics. As a result, it differs from other shale plays that can be developed in part on the basis of their uniformity. Instead, individual Monterey shale drilling sites may need to be more fully understood and may require a more precise development approach, which could affect the timing, cost and our ability to develop this asset.\nOur commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nOur commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from realizing the full benefits of price increases above any levels set in certain derivative instruments we may use to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act required the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to promulgate a range of rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions. These regulations may affect both the size of positions that we may enter and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us, potentially increasing costs for transactions. Moreover, the effects of these regulations could reduce our hedging opportunities which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices.\nRecently, proposals have been made by U.S. regulators which would implement a new approach for calculating the exposure of derivative contracts under the applicable agencies\u2019 regulatory capital rules, referred to as the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk or SA-CCR. If adopted as proposed, certain financial institutions would be required to comply with the new SA-CCR rules beginning on July 1, 2020 and the rules could significantly increase the capital requirements for certain participants in the OTC derivatives market in which we participate. These increased capital requirements could result in significant additional costs being passed through to end users like us or reduce the number of participants or products available to us in the OTC derivatives market. The effects of these regulations could reduce our hedging opportunities or substantially increase the cost of hedging, which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.\nThe European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions may implement regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to or otherwise impacted by such regulations, which could also adversely affect our hedging opportunities.\nAdverse tax law changes may affect our operations.\nWe are subject to taxation by various tax authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we do business. New legislation could be enacted by any of these government authorities that could adversely affect our business. In California, there have been numerous state and local proposals for additional income, sales, excise and property taxes, including additional taxes on oil and natural gas production. Although such proposals targeting our industry have not become law, campaigns by various interest groups could lead to additional future taxes.\nOur producing properties are located exclusively in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nOur operations are concentrated in California. Because of this geographic concentration, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of regional conditions. These include local price fluctuations, changes in state or regional laws and regulations affecting our operations and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline, transportation and storage capacity constraints, limited potential customers, infrastructure capacity and availability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies and labor. Our operations are also exposed to natural disasters and related events common to California, such as wildfires, mudslides, high winds and earthquakes. Further, our operations may be exposed to power outages, mechanical failures, industrial accidents or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells\nto be shut in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, prevent development of lease inventory before expiration and limit access to markets for our products.\nConcerns about climate change and other air quality issues may materially affect our operations or results.\nGovernmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions, and regulation of GHGs and other air quality issues, may materially affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services and reducing demand for, and consumption of, our products and services, and we may be unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs. In addition, legislative and regulatory responses to such issues at the federal, state and local level may increase our capital and operating costs and render certain wells or projects uneconomic, and potentially lower the value of our reserves and other assets. Both the EPA and California have implemented laws, regulations and policies that seek to reduce GHG emissions as discussed in Part I, Items 1 and 2 - Business and Properties - Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry. California's cap-and-trade program operates under a market system and the costs of such allowances per metric ton of GHG emissions are expected to increase in the future as CARB tightens program requirements and annually increases the minimum state auction price of allowances and reduces the state's GHG emissions cap. As the foregoing requirements become more stringent, we may be unable to implement them in a cost-effective manner, or at all.\nConcern over climate change and GHG and other emissions has also resulted in increasing political risks in California and the United States, including climate change related pledges made by various candidates for federal, state and local offices in California and certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. These include threats to ban hydraulic fracturing and other stimulation of oil and natural gas wells and permitting of various operations, pipeline infrastructure and other oil and gas facilities on government or private lands, which could negatively impact our operations and properties. Other actions that could be pursued by presidential candidates may include the reversal of the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020, as well as reversing various regulatory changes made or proposed by the Trump Administration to promote energy production and other development. Additionally, various claimants, including certain municipalities, have filed litigation alleging that energy producers are liable for damages attributed to climate change.\nIn addition, other current and proposed international agreements and federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies seek to restrict or reduce the use of petroleum products in transportation fuels, electricity generation, plastics and other applications, prohibit future sale or use of vehicles, appliances or equipment that require petroleum fuels, impose additional taxes and costs on producers and consumers of petroleum products and require or subsidize the use of renewable energy. The state has set an ambitious goal by executive order to be \"carbon-neutral\" by 2045 and initiated and funded studies to identify strategies to implement this goal. The Legislature, state agencies and various municipalities have adopted or proposed laws, regulations and policies that seek to significantly reduce emissions from vehicles, increase the use of \u201czero emission\u201d vehicles, reduce the use of plastics, increase renewable energy mandates for utilities and in residential and commercial construction, and replace natural gas appliances and infrastructure in residential and commercial buildings with electric appliances.\nGovernment authorities can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations, and various state and local agencies are conducting increased regional, community and field air monitoring specifically with respect to oil and natural gas operations. In addition, California air quality laws and regulations, particularly in Southern and Central California where most of our operations are located, are in most instances more stringent than analogous federal laws and regulations. For example, the San Joaquin Valley will be required to adopt more rigorous attainment plans under the Clean Air Act to comply with federal ozone and particulate matter standards, and these efforts could affect our activities in the region and our ability and cost to obtain permits for new or modified operations.\nTo the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG or other emissions as an increasing financial risk, this could adversely impact our cost of, and access to, capital and the value of our stock and our assets. Shareholders currently invested in oil and gas companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into other sectors, and institutional lenders may elect not to provide funding for oil and gas companies. Additionally, environmental activists, proponents of the Paris Agreement, and other governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned about climate change have sought to pressure public and private investment funds not to invest in oil and gas companies and institutional lenders to restrict oil and gas companies\u2019\naccess to capital. Limitation of investments in and financings for oil and gas companies like us could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.\nWe believe, but cannot guarantee, that our local production of oil, NGLs and natural gas will remain essential to meeting California\u2019s energy and feedstock needs for the foreseeable future. We have also established 2030 Sustainability Goals for water recycling, renewables integration, methane emission reduction and carbon capture and sequestration in our life-of-field planning that align with the state\u2019s long-term goals and support our ability to continue to efficiently implement federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to air quality and climate, in the future. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to design, permit, fund and implement such projects in a timely and cost-effective manner or at all, or that we, our customers or end users of our products will be able to satisfy long-term environmental, air quality or climate goals if those are applied as enforceable mandates.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal, state or local legislation, regulations or policies that impose more stringent standards for GHG or other emissions from our operations or otherwise restrict the areas in which we may produce oil, natural gas, NGLs or electricity or generate GHG or other emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for or value of our products and services. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in restricting or canceling oil and natural gas production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages or other losses as a result of climate change, or impairing our ability to continue to operate in an economic manner. Moreover, climate change may pose increasing risks of physical impacts to our operations and those of our suppliers, transporters and customers through damage to infrastructure and resources resulting from drought, wildfires, sea level changes, flooding and other natural disasters and other physical disruptions. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and our assets are subject to risks such as fires, explosions, releases, discharges, power outages, equipment or information technology failures and industrial accidents, as are the assets and properties of third parties who supply us with energy, equipment and services or who purchase, transport or use our products. In addition, events such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, wildfires, power outages, high winds, droughts, cyber-security, vandalism or terrorist attacks and other events may cause operations to cease or be curtailed and could adversely affect our business, workforce and the communities in which we operate. Further, recent wildfires experienced in California have limited the availability and increased the cost of obtaining insurance against certain natural disasters. We may be unable to obtain, or may elect not to obtain, insurance for certain risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nInformation technology failures and cyber-security attacks could adversely affect us.\nWe rely on electronic systems and networks to communicate, control and manage our exploration, development and production activities. We also use these systems and networks to prepare our financial management and reporting information, to analyze and store data and to communicate internally and with third parties, including our service providers and customers. If we record inaccurate data or experience infrastructure outages, our ability to communicate and control and manage our business could be adversely affected.\nCyber-security attacks on businesses have escalated and become more sophisticated in recent years and include attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, malicious software, ransomware and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or the corruption of data. In addition, our vendors, customers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber-security attacks that, in turn, could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information. If we or the third parties with whom we interact were to experience a successful attack, the potential consequences to our business, workforce and the communities in which we operate could be significant, including financial losses, loss of business, litigation risks and damage to reputation. As the sophistication of cyber-security attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to further enhance our security.", "PERMNO": 15029, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CRCQQ"}
