RISK FACTORS\nRisks and Uncertainties\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following risks highlight some of the more significant factors that have affected us and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently believe are immaterial. If any one or more such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. One should carefully consider the following factors and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any other risks discussed in our other periodic filings with the SEC before deciding to invest in our common stock.\nOur inability to successfully manage divestitures and other significant transactions could harm our financial results, business, and prospects.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, or make investments to realize anticipated benefits, actions which involve a number of inherent risks and uncertainties. We can give no assurances that the opportunities will be consummated or that financing will be available. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from strategic transactions as successfully or as rapidly as projected, if at all.\nOur future performance and market value could cause write-downs of long-lived and intangible assets in future periods.\nWe are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to review intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered to be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and resulting market capitalization, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. No impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets were recorded in 2019 or 2018.\nNo assurances can be given that we will not be required to record future significant charges related to tangible or intangible asset impairments.\nOur indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nOur indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, it could:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments of our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, or other general corporate purposes.\nOur inability to comply with covenants in place or our inability to make the required principal and interest payments may cause an event of default, which could have a substantial adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, particularly if credit market conditions deteriorate. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions would be permitted by the terms of our credit agreements or debt instruments. Our existing credit agreements contain, and any future debt agreements we may enter into may contain, certain financial tests and other covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, acquire other businesses, and may impose various other restrictions. Our ability to comply with financial tests may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, and these covenants may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. We cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with the financial tests and other covenants, or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers or amended terms from our lenders. An uncured default with respect to one or more of the covenants could result in the amounts outstanding being declared immediately due and payable, which may also trigger an obligation to redeem our outstanding debt securities and repay all other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCertain portions of our variable rate debt, including our revolving credit facility, currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. The SEC staff has stated that \u201c[i]t is expected that a number of private-sector banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021 when their current reporting commitment ends, which could either cause LIBOR to stop publication immediately or cause LIBOR\u2019s regulator to determine that its quality has degraded to the degree that it is no longer representative of its underlying market.\u201d The consequences of this and other developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but may result in an increase in the interest cost of our variable rate debt.\nProlonged depressed energy prices and other unfavorable changes in U.S., global, or regional economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.\nWe could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative changes in economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers, as well as the capital markets. Negative changes in government spending may result in delayed or permanent deferrals of existing or potential projects. No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties, including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer orders and payments, and access to available capital resources outside of operations.\nIn addition, volatile market conditions and depressed energy prices could continue for an extended period, which would negatively affect our business prospects and reduce profitability. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Sustained declines or significant and frequent fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to maintain or improve our profitability could be adversely impacted by cost pressures.\nOur profitability is dependent upon the efficient use of our resources. Rising inflation, labor costs, labor disruptions, and other increases in costs due to tariffs or other reasons in the geographic areas in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.\nManagement projections, estimates, and judgments may not be indicative of our future performance.\nOur management team is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities. Certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management\u2019s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control.\nWe are required to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on evidence available at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amount of deferred taxes recognized, which can result in earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion of our deferred taxes.\nOur business operates in highly competitive markets and a failure to react to changing market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nWe face strong competition in each of the markets in which we operate. A slow response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines could negatively impact our overall pricing. Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories. We may be required to invest more heavily to maintain and expand our product\nofferings. There can be no assurance that new product offerings will be widely accepted in the markets we serve. Significant negative developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.\nWe own a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the United States, Canada, Europe, and other countries in which product sales are possible. However, we have not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property for all products in all countries. The decision not to obtain patent and trademark protection in additional countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon our proprietary intellectual property. This could impede growth into new markets where we do not have such protections and result in a greater supply of similar products in such markets, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue.\nOur success is in part dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our management information and communications systems.\nWe are currently working through an enterprise resource program (\u201cERP\u201d) system transition. Certain divisions of our Company migrated into the new ERP system during 2016, additional divisions migrated during 2019, and certain other divisions may be transitioned during 2020 and subsequent years. The system implementation is intended to enable us to better meet the information requirements of our users, increase our integration efficiencies, and identify additional synergies in the future. The implementation of our ERP system is complex because of the wide range of processes and systems to be integrated across our business. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, operation, or implementation of our various systems, or in the performance of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business, including our ability to receive, process, ship, and bill for orders in a timely manner or our ability to properly manage our inventory or accurately present our inventory availability or pricing. Project delays, business interruptions, or loss of expected benefits could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nOur business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and other parties, including financial information, intellectual property, and personal identification information. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability, and harm our reputation and business. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent current or rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including an intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information obtained from customers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such data privacy laws and regulations, including those of the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) and the U.K. which are, in some respects, more stringent than U.S. standards, could be significant. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, legal and financial exposure, negative impacts on our customers\u2019 willingness to transact business with us, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nWe are dependent upon key customers.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers. A prolonged decrease in capital spending by our rail customers or decline in sales orders from other customers could negatively impact our sales and profitability. No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a current customer, or customers, or potential litigation with a current customer, would not also impact our future results of operations and/or financial condition.\nAn adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation or pending or future warranty claims against the Company or its subsidiaries or our determination that a customer has a substantial product warranty claim could negatively impact our financial results and/or our financial condition.\nWe are party to various legal proceedings. In addition, from time to time our customers assert claims against us relating to the warranties which apply to products we have sold. There is the potential that an outcome adverse to us or our subsidiaries in pending or future legal proceedings or pending or future product warranty claims could materially exceed any accruals we have established and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition. In addition, we could suffer a significant loss of business from a customer who is dissatisfied with the resolution of a warranty claim.\nA portion of our sales are derived from our international operations, which expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.\nDoing business outside the United States subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts, and unexpected changes in U.S. and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments, and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign\ncountries, including Canada, China, India, Mexico, the U.K., and countries within the E.U., exposes the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, unable to alter our business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.\nChanges in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets. Fluctuations in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro may result in volatile earnings to reflect exchange rate translation in our Canadian and European sales and operations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro, our reported earnings in dollars from sales in those currencies will be unfavorable. Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the U.S. dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.\nPursuant to a June 2016 referendum, the U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The U.K. government and the E.U. are operating under a transitional arrangement that expires on December 31, 2020, and the parties are working on the terms of a future relationship, including a potential trade agreement. The nature and terms of the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. remain subject to negotiation and uncertain. Additionally, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainties related to applicable laws and regulations that apply to our operations and as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws and regulations to adopt, replace, or disregard. There has been volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, which could continue. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. has also created market volatility and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, political institutions, and regulatory agencies as negotiations of trade deals between the U.K. and the E.U., and also between the U.K. and other countries, possibly including the U.S., occur during the transition period. Brexit is an unprecedented event, and, accordingly, it is unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade, and legal effects will result.\nThe majority of our U.K. operations are heavily concentrated within the U.K. borders; however, this could adversely affect the future growth of our U.K. operations into other European locations. Our U.K. operations represented approximately 9% and 11% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, less than 1% of our consolidated net revenue was from the U.K. operation\u2019s sales exported to E.U. members other than the U.K.\nMaterial modification to the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and certain other international trade agreements could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe current Presidential administration has made comments suggesting it is not supportive of certain international trade agreements, including NAFTA. On November 30, 2018, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) was signed by the parties, and has been ratified by each country except Canada. At this time, it remains unclear what the current administration and Congress would or would not do with respect to these international trade agreements. Potential material modifications to NAFTA, or certain other international trade agreements, including USMCA, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nViolations of foreign governmental regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers, or both and could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nOur foreign operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, as well as U.S. laws. These regulations include those related to currency conversion, repatriation of earnings, taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel, and the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers, including, in some jurisdictions, mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, prohibit improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have established an internal control structure, corporate policies, compliance, and training processes to reduce the risk of violation, we cannot ensure that these procedures protect us from violations of such policies by our employees or agents. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, and suspension or debarment from contracting. Events of non-compliance could harm our reputation, reduce our revenues and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Violations of such laws or allegations of violation could disrupt our business and result in material adverse results to our operating results or future profitability.\nCertain divisions of our business depend on a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such supplier could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nIn our Rail Products business unit, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers. In addition, our Piling division is predominantly dependent upon one supplier for sheet piling while our Protective Coatings division is predominately dependent on two suppliers of epoxy coating. A significant downturn in the business of one or more of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us, or a disruption in the availability of existing and new piling and rail products may adversely impact our financial results.\nFluctuations in the price, quality, and availability of the primary raw materials used in our business could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nMany of our businesses utilize steel as a significant product component. The steel industry is cyclical and prices and availability are subject to these cycles, as well as to international market forces. We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our Concrete Ties and Precast Concrete Products businesses. No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.\nLabor disputes may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nFour of our manufacturing facilities are staffed by employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 111 employees employed at these facilities are currently working under three separate collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to renegotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a disruption of our operations and have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nActions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nIn February 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with an activist investor, Legion Partners Asset Management, LLC and various of its affiliates (collectively, \u201cLegion Partners\u201d) that had filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC with respect to the Company. This agreement expired by its terms on February 13, 2018, and Legion Partners remains a greater than 5% owner of Company stock.\nActivist investors may attempt to effect changes in the Company\u2019s strategic direction and how the Company is governed, or to acquire control over the Company. Some investors seek to increase short-term shareholder value by advocating corporate actions, such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. While the Company welcomes varying opinions from all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of the Company\u2019s board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nOur success is highly dependent on the continued service and availability of qualified personnel.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, the executive team, and other highly skilled employees. Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to compete and lead to a reduction in our profitability.\nWe may not foresee or be able to control certain events that could adversely affect our business.\nUnexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, armed conflicts, terrorism, health epidemics or pandemics, economic or political uncertainties or instability, civil unrest, strikes, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or disruptions in certain areas of our operations, may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise negatively impact our financial performance.\nShifting federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory policies impose risks to our operations.\nWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies and are therefore subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks, including those described in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Like other companies engaged in environmentally sensitive businesses, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations, including environmental matters relating to, among other things, the treatment, disposal, and storage of wastes, investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the discharge of effluent into waterways, and the emissions of substances into the air. We are required to obtain various authorizations, permits, approvals, and certificates from governmental agencies. The Company could be subject to liability with respect to remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities and remediation of contamination by former owners or operators of the Company\u2019s current or former facilities. Compliance with emerging regulatory initiatives, delays, discontinuations, or reversals of existing regulatory policies in the markets in which we operate, including costs associated with any required environmental remediation and monitoring, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our operations is heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects. Many of these projects have \u201cBuy America\u201d or \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions. Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results. Additionally, government actions concerning \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results.", "PERMNO": 37402, "SIC": 5051, "TIC": "FSTR"}
