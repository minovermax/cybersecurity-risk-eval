RISK FACTORS\nImportant risk factors that could impact our ability to achieve our anticipated operating results and growth plan goals are presented below. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with discussions of our business and the factors affecting our business located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC.\nDemand for our systems and services depends on oil and gas industry activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by trends in the demand for and price of crude oil and natural gas.\nWe are substantially dependent on conditions in the oil and gas industry, including the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. Any substantial or extended decline in these expenditures may result in the reduced pace of discovery and development of new reserves of oil and gas and the reduced exploitation of existing wells, which could adversely affect demand for our systems and services and, in certain instances, result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing orders in our backlog. These factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which, historically, have been volatile.\nFactors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndemand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions;\n\u2022\ncosts of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest;\n\u2022\navailable excess production capacity within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and the level of oil production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\noil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\npotential acceleration of the development of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\naccess to capital and credit markets, which may affect our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending for our products and services; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe industries in which we operate or have operated expose us to potential liabilities arising out of the installation or use of our systems that could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are subject to equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, equipment misuse and natural disasters, the occurrence of which may result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. Although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks, our insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities. Further, the insurance may not generally be available in the future or, if available, premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, such potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur operations require us to comply with numerous U.S. and international regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are exposed to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to matters such as environmental, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export control, currency exchange, bribery and corruption and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expand in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operations outside of the United States require us to comply with numerous anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations under the laws of the United States and various other countries. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) Bribery Act and the Brazilian Anti-Bribery Act (also known as the Brazilian Clean Company Act), among others, apply to us and our operations. We have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs for our employees and agents with respect to these regulations. However, our policies, procedures and programs may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents, and severe criminal or civil sanctions may be imposed as a result of violations of these laws. We are also subject to the risks that our employees, joint venture partners and agents outside of the United States may fail to comply with applicable laws.\nMoreover, we import raw materials, semi-finished goods, as well as finished products into many countries for use in such countries or for manufacturing and/or finishing for re-export and import into another country for use or further integration into equipment or systems. Most movement of raw materials, semi-finished or finished products involves imports and exports. As a result, compliance with multiple trade sanctions, embargoes and import/export laws and regulations, as well as the recently enacted conflict minerals reporting requirements, pose a constant challenge and risk to us since our business is conducted on a worldwide basis through various subsidiaries. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could materially affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations in the United States and regulations in foreign countries affect the equipment, systems and services we design, market and sell, as well as the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems. We are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental laws and regulations and believe that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, or the issuance of orders enjoining operations. These laws and regulations, as well as the adoption of new legal requirements or other laws and regulations affecting exploration and development of drilling for crude oil and natural gas, could adversely affect our business and operating results by increasing our costs, limiting the demand for our systems and services or restricting our operations.\nInternational, national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and/or promulgating legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. For instance, under the U.S. Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has made findings that GHG emissions endanger public health and the environment, resulting in the EPA\u2019s adoption of regulations requiring construction and operating permit reviews of certain stationary sources with major emissions of GHGs, which reviews may require the installation of best available control technologies typically approved by the states and the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In addition, in June 2014, the EPA, acting under President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan, proposed its Clean Power Plan, which would set U.S. state-by-state guidelines for power plants to reduce their carbon emissions and cut pollution, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. To the extent our customers are subject to these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, the additional costs incurred by our customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at current or anticipated levels, which would negatively impact their demand for our systems and services. In addition, any new laws or regulations establishing cap-and-trade and those that favor the increased use of non-fossil fuels may dampen demand for oil and gas production and lead to lower spending by our customers for our systems and services. Similarly, to the extent we are or become subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, we expect that our efforts to monitor, report and comply with such laws and regulations, and any related taxes imposed on companies by such programs, will increase our cost of doing business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nMoreover, environmental concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing or \u201cfracking\u201d on underground water supplies. We provide equipment and services to companies employing this enhanced recovery technique. There have been several regulatory and governmental initiatives in the United States to restrict the hydraulic fracturing process, which could have an adverse impact on our customers\u2019 completion or production activities. For example, the U.S. Department of the Interior has issued proposed regulations that would apply to hydraulic fracturing operations on wells that are subject to federal oil and gas leases and that would impose requirements regarding the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as requirements to obtain certain federal approvals before proceeding with hydraulic fracturing at a well site. This and other similar state and foreign regulatory initiatives, if adopted, would establish additional levels of regulation for our customers that could make it more difficult for our customers to complete natural gas and oil wells and could adversely affect the demand for our equipment and services, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDisruptions in the political, regulatory, economic and social conditions of the countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe operate manufacturing facilities in the United States and in various countries across the world. Instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we conduct business, including economically and politically volatile areas such as North Africa, West Africa, the Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States, could have an adverse effect on the demand for our systems and services, our financial condition or our results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nnationalization and expropriation;\n\u2022\npotentially burdensome taxation;\n\u2022\ninflationary and recessionary markets, including capital and equity markets;\n\u2022\ncivil unrest, labor issues, political instability, terrorist attacks, cyber-terrorism, military activity and wars;\n\u2022\nsupply disruptions in key oil producing countries;\n\u2022\nability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions, trade protection measures or price controls;\n\u2022\nforeign ownership restrictions;\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on operations, trade practices, trade partners and investment decisions resulting from domestic and foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in, and the administration of, laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ninability to repatriate income or capital;\n\u2022\nreductions in the availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations or currency restrictions; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the interest rate component of forward foreign currency rates.\nBecause a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in our revenue, costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside of the United States and the amount of our stockholders\u2019 equity. Although it is our policy to seek to minimize our currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where appropriate, our efforts may not be successful. Moreover, certain currencies, specifically currencies in countries such as Angola and Nigeria where we have expanding operations, do not actively trade in the global foreign exchange markets and may subject us to increased foreign currency exposures. To the extent we sell our products and services in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products and services becoming too expensive for foreign customers. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may lose money on fixed-price contracts.\nAs is customary for the types of businesses in which we operate, we often agree to provide products and services under fixed-price contracts. Under these contracts, we are typically responsible for cost overruns. Our actual costs and any gross profit realized on these fixed-price contracts may vary from the estimated amounts on which these contracts were originally based. There is inherent risk in the estimation process, including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges or longer than expected lead times. A fixed-price contract may prohibit our ability to mitigate the impact of unanticipated increases in raw material prices through increased pricing. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDisruptions in the timely delivery of our backlog could affect our future sales, profitability, and our relationships with our customers.\nMany of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times due to complex technical and logistical requirements. These contracts may contain penalty clauses relating to on-time delivery, and a failure by us to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to contractual penalties, reduce our margins on these contracts or result in damage to existing customer relationships. The ability to meet customer delivery schedules for this backlog is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, access to the raw materials required for production, an adequately trained and capable workforce, subcontractor performance, project engineering expertise, sufficient manufacturing plant capacity and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources. Failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance, particularly in light of the current industry environment where customers may seek to improve their returns or cash flows.\nDue to the types of contracts we enter into, the cumulative loss of several major contracts or alliances may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe often enter into large, long-term contracts that, collectively, represent a significant portion of our revenue. These agreements, if terminated or breached, may have a larger impact on our operating results or our financial condition than shorter-term contracts due to the value at risk. If we were to lose several key alliances or agreements over a relatively short period of time we could experience a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreased costs of raw materials and other components may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by our inability to manage the rising costs and availability of raw materials and components used in our wide variety of products and systems. Unexpected changes in the size and timing of regional and/or product markets, particularly for short lead-time products, could affect our results of operations or cash flows.\nMoreover, in August 2012, the SEC issued its final rule to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements by public companies of their use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We conducted required due diligence activities for the 2013 calendar year and filed our first Form SD report with the SEC in June 2014. While the conflict minerals rule continues in effect as adopted, there remains uncertainty regarding how the conflict minerals rule, and our compliance obligations, will be affected in the future. Specifically, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the conflict minerals rule in April 2014, but in November 2014, it granted the SEC\u2019s and Amnesty International\u2019s petitions for rehearing regarding certain disclosure requirements of the rule. Additional requirements under the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain of the conflict minerals used in the manufacture of our products or in the provision of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to purchase these products in the future. The costs of compliance, including those related to supply chain research, the limited number of suppliers and possible changes in the sourcing of these minerals, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nA failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. Accordingly, we rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. Despite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, incursions by intruders or hackers, failures in hardware or software, power fluctuations, cyber terrorists and other similar disruptions. Although no such material incidents have occurred to date, the failure of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of operations, inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, increased overhead costs and loss of important information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nOur success depends on our ability to implement new technologies and services.\nOur success depends on the ongoing development and implementation of new product designs and improvements and on our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. If we are not able to obtain patent or other protection of our technology, we may not be able to continue to develop systems, services and technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, and if so, at prices acceptable to our customers.\nUninsured claims and litigation against us, including intellectual property litigation, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation, as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings. We have insurance coverage against operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products, to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available. However, no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance.\nIn addition, the tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs.\nA deterioration in future expected profitability or cash flows could result in an impairment of our recorded goodwill.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when impairment indicators arise. A lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments. Factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include changes in customer demand, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions, such as decreased prices in similar market-based transactions, which could impact future earnings of the reporting unit.\nAt December 31, 2014, recorded goodwill of $75.8 million was associated with our completion services reporting unit. The recent decline in crude oil prices has introduced some uncertainty associated with certain key assumptions used in estimating fair value of the reporting unit. Depressed crude oil prices for a prolonged period of time may adversely affect the economics of certain of our customers\u2019 projects, particularly for shale-related projects in North America, and may reduce the demand for completion services, negatively impacting the financial results of the reporting unit. Management is monitoring the overall market, specifically crude oil prices, and its effect on the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test for completion services, which may require re-evaluation and could result in an impairment of goodwill for this reporting unit.\nAt December 31, 2014, recorded goodwill of $30.7 million was associated with our automation and control reporting unit. During 2014 the automation and control reporting unit realized significantly lower sales volumes, leading to negative operating results for the year and creating some uncertainty regarding future demand for certain products. Management has undertaken efforts to integrate the reporting unit\u2019s UCOS\u00ae product with our Master Control Station in our subsea systems business to promote cost and efficiency savings in our subsea product offering by utilizing the UCOS\u00ae Master Control Station as the standard for control system applications in subsea production, processing and workover systems. Management is evaluating the realizability of these savings and its effect on the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test for automation and control, which may require re-evaluation and could result in an impairment of goodwill for this reporting unit.\nA downgrade in the rating of our debt could restrict our ability to access the capital markets.\nChanges in the ratings assigned to our debt may impact our access to the debt capital markets. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted. Moreover, our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. An increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.", "PERMNO": 89004, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "FTI.1"}
