Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements set forth immediately prior to the beginning of Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. The following list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact the Company\u2019s ability to achieve results discussed in any forward-looking statement. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are subject to extensive medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval process for our products and, in some cases, may not ultimately result in approval or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products.\nOur products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \"FDC Act\"), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In addition, most major markets for medical devices outside the U.S. require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:\n\u2022 take a significant period of time;\n\u2022 require the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022 involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing;\n\u2022 require changes to the products; and\n\u2022 result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products.\nEven after products have received marketing approval or clearance, product approvals and clearances by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required clearances from the FDA for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any FDA approval will not be subsequently withdrawn. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes and registrations of products outside the United States.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a medical device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Community and China, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Failure to meet regulatory quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.\nWe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and, in recent years, it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the marketing of new devices. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, and if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are and will be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and also attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash or royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found invalid.\nIn addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or know-how or to assert our intellectual property rights against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming to us and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful.\nThe invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture product liability claims and other litigation, including private securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits, may adversely affect our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical device products of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.\nAnyone or any company can bring an action against Misonix.\nOur judicial system allows anyone to bring a claim against the Company and force the Company to defend itself even if the claim is baseless. The defense may or may not be covered by the Company\u2019s insurance, the result of which could ultimately create a burden on the Company dependent upon the outcome.\nOur future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and line extensions, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals, all of which are very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in a commercially viable product.\nIn order to develop new products and improve current product offerings, we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and opportunities.\nAs a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA for new products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market's perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals from the FDA, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.\nNew products may not be accepted in the market.\nWe are now, and will continue to be, developing new products and introducing them into the market. There can be no assurance that any new product will be accepted by the market. New products are sometimes introduced into the market in a prototype format and may need later revisions or design changes before they operate in a manner to be accepted in the market. As a result of the introduction of new products, there is some risk that revenue expectations may not be met and in some cases the product may not achieve market acceptance.\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical device industry.\nThe medical device product market is highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do.\nAdditionally, the medical device product market is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technology may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our revenues. In some cases foreign companies may attempt to copy our designs illegally. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, attract and retain skilled development personnel, obtain patent and other protection for our technology and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products. Failure to develop new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments.\nThe cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals. This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may experience disruption in supply due to our dependence on our suppliers to continue to ship product requirements and our inability to obtain suppliers of certain components for our products.\nOur suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunctions, labor shortages or environmental factors. In addition, we purchase both raw materials used in our products and finished goods from various suppliers and may have to rely on a single source supplier for certain components of our products where there are no alternatives are available. Although we anticipate that we have adequate sources of supply and/or inventory of these components to handle our production needs for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to secure on a timely basis sufficient quantities of the materials we depend on to manufacture our products, if we encounter delays or contractual or other difficulties in our relationships with these suppliers, or if we cannot find suppliers at an acceptable cost, then the manufacture of our products may be disrupted, which could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to manage any expansion or acquisition, our business could be impaired.\nWe may in the future acquire one or more technologies, products or companies that complement our business. We may not be able to effectively integrate these into our business and any such acquisition could bring additional risks, exposures and challenges to the Company. In addition, acquisitions may dilute our earnings per share, disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses, subject us to liabilities and increase our risk of litigation, all of which could harm our business. If we use cash to acquire technologies, products, or companies, such use may divert resources otherwise available for other purposes. If we use our common stock to acquire technologies, products, or companies, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution. If we fail to manage any expansions or acquisition, our business could be impaired.\nOur agreements and contracts entered into with partners and other third parties may not be successful.\nWe signed in the past and may pursue in the future agreements and contracts with third parties to assist in our marketing, manufacturing, selling and distribution efforts. We cannot assure you that any agreements or contracts entered into will be successful.\nThe current disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on favorable terms (or at all) and have other adverse effects on us.\nThe United States credit markets have recently experienced historic dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused financing to be unavailable in many cases and even if available caused spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers able to find financing less attractive, and in many cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms or at all. In addition, Federal legislation to deal with the current disruptions in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe fluctuation of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur revenues and results of operations have in the past and will likely vary in the future from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. You should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. It is likely that in some future quarters, our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this event, the price of our common stock may fall.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain additional key management, sales and marketing and technical personnel, or we may lose existing key management, sales and marketing or technical personnel, which may delay our development and marketing efforts.\nWe depend on a number of key management, sales and marketing and technical personnel. The loss of the services of one or more key employees could delay the achievement of our development and marketing objectives. Our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management, sales and marketing and technical personnel to meet our growth goals. We face intense competition for qualified personnel, many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers, and we do not know whether we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse or unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nAdverse litigation results could affect our business.\nLitigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Affordable Healthcare for America Act includes provisions that may adversely affect our business and results of operations, including an excise tax on the sales of most medical devices.\nOn March 21, 2010, the House of Representatives passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act, which President Obama signed into law on March 23, 2010. While the current evaluation for this legislation is not material, its potential impact on the Company may adversely affect our business and results of operations. The medical device tax has been established, but in the future the government may decide to increase the tax rate.\nWe are subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nOur international operations must comply with U.S. law, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in the foreign jurisdiction. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Although we are not aware of any incidents, we could be the subject of claims that may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or reputation. Violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions.\nWe are experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater regulation in the future.\nOur medical devices and our business activities are subject to rigorous regulation, including by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. Certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with health care providers. As a result, we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to health care providers licensed by certain states and, starting with payments or other transfers of value made on or after August 1, 2013, to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the federal level. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement policies, systems, and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business. We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects on our operations.\nRisk of reprocessing disposables.\nIn some jurisdictions around the world culture and practice encourages reuse when the product is clearly labeled for single use.", "PERMNO": 77282, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "MSON"}
