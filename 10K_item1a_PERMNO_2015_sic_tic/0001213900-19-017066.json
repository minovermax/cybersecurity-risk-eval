{"cik": "1066923", "company": "Future FinTech Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-09-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the following risk factors, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed herein, and in other documents that the Company subsequently files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (the \u201cCommission\u201d or the \u201cSEC\u201d), that update, supplement or supersede such information for which documents are incorporated by reference into this Report. Additional risks not presently known to the Company, or which the Company considers immaterial based on information currently available, may also materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. If any of the events anticipated by the risks described herein occur, the Company\u2019s business, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, which could result in a decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, causing you to lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur revenue and profitability are heavily dependent on prevailing prices for our products and raw materials, and if we are unable to effectively offset cost increases by adjusting the pricing of our products, our margins and operating income may decrease.\nOur revenue, gross margins and cash flows from juice products are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices we receive for our products and the cost of our raw materials, neither of which we control. The factors influencing the sales price of concentrated fruit juice include the supply price of fresh fruit, supply and demand of our products in international and domestic markets and competition in the fruit juice industry.\nThe price of our principal raw materials, fresh fruit, is subject to market volatility as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, governmental regulations, weather, transportation delays and other uncertainties that are beyond our control. Due to such market volatility, we generally do not, nor do we expect to, have long-term contracts with our fresh fruit suppliers. Other significant raw materials used in our business include packing barrels, pectic enzyme, amylase and auxiliary materials such as coal, electricity and water. Prices for these items may be volatile as well and we may experience shortages in these items from time to time. As a result, we cannot guarantee that the necessary raw materials to produce our juice products will continue to be available to us at prices currently in effect or acceptable to us. In the event raw material prices increase materially, we may not be able to adjust our juice product prices, especially in the short term, to recover such cost increases. If we are not able to effectively offset these cost increases by adjusting the price of our products, our margins will decrease and earnings for our juice business will suffer accordingly.\nIf we fail to maintain membership loyalty or sustain membership growth, or fail to maintain member relationships effectively and retain existing members, our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are a membership-based value sharing e-commerce platform and therefore membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The growth of our business depends on our ability to maintain and increase the number of members on our platform and improve the level of their engagement. Individuals can become our members mainly by purchasing our membership at a fixed price. We currently do not charge membership renewal fees or periodic membership fees. We may decide to charge membership renewal fees or other type of fees in the future. Such change in practice may negatively impact the membership loyalty and result in a decline in the level of engagement of our members. Damage to our reputation or our failure to anticipate needs of and provide value-added services to our members, among other things, could also diminish membership loyalty and reduce activity of members on our platform, which could cause our revenue and operating income to decline and negatively impact our profitability. If our existing and new business opportunities and incentives, products, services and other initiatives do not generate sufficient enthusiasm and economic incentive to retain our existing members or attract new members on a sustained basis, our operating results could be adversely affected. As a result, in order to maintain our business growth in the future, we need to increase our retention of existing members and continue to successfully attract additional members.\nWeather and other environmental factors affect our raw material supply and a reduction in the quality or quantity of our fresh fruit supplies may have material adverse consequences on our financial results.\nOur juice business may be adversely affected by weather and environmental factors beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions during the growing or squeezing seasons. A significant reduction in the quantity or quality of fresh fruit harvested resulting from adverse weather conditions, disease or other factors could result in increased per unit processing costs and decreased production, with adverse financial consequences to us.\nWe sell our juice products primarily through distributors and delays in delivery or poor handling by distributors may affect our sales and damage our reputation.\nWe primarily sell our juice products through our distributors and rely on these distributors for the distribution of our products. These distributors are not obligated to continue to sell our products. Any disruptions in our relationships with our distributors could cause interruption to the supply of our juice products to retailers, which would harm our revenue and results of operations. In addition, delivery disruptions may occur for various reasons beyond our control, including poor handling by distributors or third party transport operators, transportation bottlenecks, natural disasters and labor strikes, and could lead to delayed or lost deliveries. Some of our juice products are perishable and poor handling by distributors and third party transport operators could also result in damage to our products that would make them unfit for sale. If our juice products are not delivered to retailers on time, or are delivered damaged, we may have to pay compensation, we could lose business and our reputation could be harmed.\nBecause we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate and our annual performance will depend largely on results from our first and fourth quarters.\nOur fruit juice business is highly seasonal, reflecting the harvest season of our primary source fruits from July or August of a year to April the following year. Typically, a substantial portion of our revenue from fruit juice products is earned during our first and fourth quarters. We generally experience lower revenue during our second and third quarters. If sales in our first and fourth quarters are lower than expected, our operating results would be adversely affected and it would have a disproportionately large impact on our annual operating results.\nIf we are unable to gain market acceptance or significant market share for the new products we introduce, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nOur future business and financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to successfully respond to consumer preferences by introducing new products and improving existing products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to gain market acceptance or significant market share for our new products. Consumer preferences change, and any new products that we introduce may fail to meet the particular tastes or requirements of consumers, or may be unable to replace their existing preferences. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these particular tastes or changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause us to be unable to recover our development, production and marketing costs, thereby leading to a decline in our profitability.\nThe development and introduction of new products is key to our expansion strategy. We incur significant development and marketing costs in connection with the introduction of new products. Successfully launching and selling new products puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources, and we may fail to invest sufficient funds in order to market and sell a new product effectively. If we are not successful in marketing and selling new products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on consumer spending on our products.\nThe worldwide economy remains volatile and may contract in the near future. The adverse effect of a sustained international economic downturn, including sustained periods of decreased consumer spending, high unemployment levels, declining consumer or business confidence and continued volatility and disruption in the credit and capital markets, would likely result in reduced demand for our products as consumers turn to less expensive substitute goods or forego certain purchases altogether. To the extent an international economic downturn develops, we could experience a reduction in sales volume. If we are unable to reduce our operating costs and expenses proportionately, many of which are fixed, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nConcerns over food safety and public health may affect our juice business by increasing our costs and negatively impacting demand for our products.\nWe could be adversely affected by diminishing confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients. As a result, we may elect or be required to incur additional costs aimed at increasing consumer confidence in the safety of our juice products. For example, a crisis in the PRC over melamine contaminated milk in 2008 has adversely impacted Chinese food exports since October 2008, as reported by the Chinese General Administration of Customs, although most foods exported from the PRC were not significantly affected by the melamine contamination. In addition, our concentrated fruit juices exported to foreign countries must comply with quality standards in those countries. Our success depends on our ability to maintain the quality of our existing and new products. Product quality issues, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products.\nWe face increasing competition from both domestic and foreign companies, and any failure by us to compete effectively could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe juice beverage industry is highly competitive, and we expect it to continue to become even more competitive. Our ability to compete in the industry depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to distinguish our products from those of our competitors by providing high quality products at reasonable prices that appeal to consumers\u2019 tastes and preferences. There are currently a number of well-established companies producing products that compete directly with ours. Some of our competitors may have been in business longer than we have, may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may be better established in their markets. We anticipate that our competitors will continue to improve their products and introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics.\nWe cannot guarantee that our current or potential competitors will not provide juice products comparable or superior to those we provide or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements. It is also possible that there will be significant consolidation in the juice beverage industry among our competitors, and alliances may develop among competitors. These alliances may rapidly acquire significant market share, and some of our distributors may commence production of products similar to those we sell to them. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our profit margins. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Aggressive marketing or pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions involving significant expenditures of cash, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of stock, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product and service offerings, augment our market coverage, enhance our technological capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. From time to time, we review investments in new businesses and we expect to make investments in, and to acquire, businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of any future acquisitions, we may expend significant cash, incur substantial debt and/or issue equity securities and dilute the percentage ownership of current shareholders, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and the price of our Common Stock. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we may acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe require various licenses and permits to operate our juice business, and the loss of or failure to renew any or all of these licenses and permits could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn accordance with PRC laws and regulations, we have been required to maintain various licenses and permits in order to operate our business at the relevant manufacturing facilities including, without limitation, industrial product production permits. We are required to comply with applicable hygiene and food safety standards in relation to our production processes. Our premises and transportation vehicles are subject to regular inspections by the regulatory authorities for compliance with the Detailed Rules for Administration and Supervision of Quality and Safety in Food Producing and Processing Enterprises. Failure to pass these inspections, or the loss of or failure to renew our licenses and permits, could require us to temporarily or permanently suspend some or all of our production activities, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nGovernmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenue.\nThe United States and various other governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the export of some of our products. Governmental regulation of exports, or our failure to obtain required export approval for our products, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue and profits. In addition, failure to comply with such regulations could result in penalties, costs and restrictions on export privileges. Additionally, the U.S. has imposed additional tariffs on products from China . Uncertainty regarding policies affecting global trade may make it difficult for our management to accurately forecast our business, and increases in the duties, tariffs and other charges imposed on our products by the United States or other countries in which on our products are sold, or other restraints on international trade, could negatively affect our business and the results of our operations.\nIf our business model were found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn August 2005, the State Council promulgated the Regulations on the Prohibition of Pyramid Selling, which prohibits individuals and entities in China from engaging in pyramid selling. See \u201cRegulation-Regulations Relating to Pyramid Selling in the PRC.\u201d We believe that our current business model is not in violation of applicable PRC laws and regulations, including the Regulations on the Prohibition of Pyramid Selling. However, there is no assurance that the competent governmental authorities in China will share our view, or that they will find our business model not in violation of any applicable regulations, given the uncertainties in the interpretation and application of existing PRC laws, regulations and policies relating to our current business model, including, but not limited to, regulations regulating pyramid selling. Moreover, new laws, regulations or policies may also be promulgated in the future, and there is no assurance that our current business model will be in full compliance with the new laws, regulations or policies. If our business model were to be found in violation in the future, we will have to make adjustments to our business model or cease certain of our business operations, and the relevant governmental authorities may confiscate any illegal gains and impose a fine, which would have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not presently maintain product liability insurance, and our property and equipment insurance does not cover the full value of our property and equipment, which leaves us with exposure in the event of loss or damage to our properties or claims filed against us.\nWe currently do not carry any product liability or other similar insurance. Product liability claims and lawsuits in the PRC generally are still rare, unlike in some other countries. Product liability exposures and litigation, however, could become more commonplace in the PRC. Moreover, we have product liability exposure in countries in which we sell our products, such as the United States, where product liability claims are more prevalent.\nWe may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific copackers, markets or batches. Although historically we have not had any recall of our products, we cannot guarantee that circumstances or incidents will not occur that will require us to recall our products. We do not maintain recall insurance. In the event we experience product liability claims or a product recall, our business operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business and operations may be subject to disruption from work stoppages, terrorism or natural disasters.\nOur operations may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters. If a major incident were to occur in either of the regions where our facilities or main offices are located, our facilities or offices or those of critical suppliers could be damaged or destroyed. Such a disruption could result in a reduction in available raw materials, the temporary or permanent loss of critical data, suspension of operations, delays in shipment of products and disruption of business generally, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur success depends substantially on the continued retention of certain key personnel and our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel in the future to support our growth.\nIf one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business may be disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. While we depend on the abilities and participation of our current management team generally, we rely particularly upon Mr. Yongke Xue, our chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d); Mr. Zhi Yan, a member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and our Chief Technology Officer; and Ms. Veronica Chen, our chief financial officer (\u201cCFO\u201d). The loss of the services of Messrs. Yongke Xue, Zhi Yan or Ms. Chen for any reason could significantly adversely impact our business and results of operations. Competition for senior management and senior technology personnel in the PRC is intense and the pool of qualified candidates is very limited. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the services of our senior executives and other key personnel will continue to be available to us, or that we will be able to find a suitable replacement for them if they were to leave.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. Our internal controls may be determined not to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, decrease the value of our Common Stock.\nThe PRC has not adopted management and financial reporting concepts and practices similar to those in the United States. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified finance and management employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing and maintaining accounting and financial controls, collecting financial data, budgeting, managing our funds and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet investors\u2019 expectations in the United States.\nRules adopted by the SEC, or the Commission, pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 require annual assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. This requirement first applied to our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal controls over financial reporting as effective are relatively new and complex, and they require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could harm our business and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nWe may need additional capital to fund our future operations and, if it is not available when needed, we may need to reduce our planned development and marketing efforts, which may reduce our sales revenue.\nWe believe that our existing working capital and cash available from operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, if cash from future operations is insufficient, or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses, we may need additional capital. The development and marketing of new products and business and the expansion of distribution channels and associated support personnel require a significant commitment of resources. In addition, if the markets for our products and shared shopping mall develop more slowly than anticipated, or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve sufficient net revenues, we may continue to consume significant amounts of capital. As a result, we could be required to raise additional capital. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of the shares held by existing stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, such securities may provide the holders certain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of common stockholders, and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. We cannot guarantee that additional capital, if required, will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned business development and marketing efforts, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies. We hold twenty-one patents in the PRC covering our fruit processing technology. The process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive and we cannot guarantee that our existing or future issued patents will be sufficient to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantages. We also cannot guarantee that our current or potential competitors do not have, and will not obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make or sell our products in the PRC or other countries.\nThe implementation and enforcement of PRC intellectual property laws historically have not been vigorous or consistent. Accordingly, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in the PRC are not as effective as those in the United States and other countries. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend patents issued to us or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of others. Such litigation will require significant expenditures of cash and management efforts and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, competitive position, business prospects and reputation.\nOur ecommerce business depends on the continued use of the Internet and the adequacy of the Internet infrastructure.\nOur ecommerce business depends upon the widespread use of the Internet and ecommerce. Factors which could reduce the widespread use of the Internet for ecommerce include actual or perceived lack of security of information or privacy protection, cyberattacks or other disruptions or damage to the Internet or to users\u2019 computers, significant increases in the costs of transportation of goods, and taxation and governmental regulation.\nOur ecommerce business depends on our Website, network infrastructure and transaction-processing systems.\nOur ecommerce business is completely dependent on our infrastructure. Any system interruption that results in the unavailability of our Website or reduced performance of our transaction systems could reduce our ability to conduct our business. We use internally and externally developed systems for our Website and our transaction processing systems. We expect to experience system interruptions due to software failure. We may also experience temporary capacity constraints due to sharply increased traffic during sales or other promotions and during the holiday shopping season. Capacity constraints can cause system disruptions, slower response times, delayed page presentation, degradation in levels of customer service and other problems. We may also experience difficulties with our infrastructure upgrades. Any future difficulties with our transaction processing systems or difficulties upgrading, expanding or integrating aspects of our systems may cause system disruptions, slower response times, and degradation in levels of customer service, additional expense, impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment or other problems.\nIf the location where all of our computer and communications hardware is located is compromised, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. If we suffer an interruption or degradation of services at the location for any reason, our business could be harmed. Our success, and in particular, our ability to successfully receive and fulfill orders and provide high-quality customer service, largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems. These limitations could have an adverse effect on our conversion rate and sales. Our disaster recovery plan may be inadequate, and we do not carry business interruption insurance to compensate us for the losses that could occur. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, the occurrence of any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the inability to accept and fulfill customer orders. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could harm our business.\nOur platform requires frequent updates on pricing from our vendors. If these updates are inaccurate or do not occur, there could be a negative influence on our business.\nWe update the prices of products listed on our site frequently through a third party vendor. If we are unable to obtain, or are not provided updated pricing information from our third party vendor, or if we fail to act on information provided by our third party vendor, then it could cause us to remedy the pricing difference to complete the transaction, or source the product from an alternative vendor at their price.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nOur ecommerce business is entirely dependent on the secure operation of our website and systems as well as the operation of the Internet generally. Our business involves the storage and transmission of users\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. A number of large Internet companies have suffered security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. From time to time we and many other Internet businesses also may be subject to a denial of service attacks wherein attackers attempt to block customers\u2019 access to our Website. If we are unable to avert a denial of service attack for any significant period, we could sustain substantial revenue loss from lost sales and customer dissatisfaction. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks.\nCyberattacks may target us, our customers, our suppliers, banks, payment processors, ecommerce in general or the communication infrastructure on which we depend. If an actual or perceived attack or breach of our security occurs, customer and/or supplier perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers, suppliers or both. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants. A person who is able to circumvent our security measures might be able to misappropriate our or our users\u2019 proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.\nOur transition to blockchain-related products and services may subject us to new laws, rules and regulations that may materially adversely affect the development and the value of such assets and lines of business.\nFollowing the completion of the contemplated spin-off of our fruit juice business, our main businesses will be e-commerce, financial leasing and project finance, investment and asset management, business incubation and acceleration services for blockchain companies, blockchain related training, capital market and consulting services as well as using blockchain technology for these businesses, such as the DCON payment system. Our new businesses create the risk that we will be subject to the laws and regulations of a number of jurisdictions, which we intend to continually work with counsel to identify and with which we intend to conform. Identifying the application of, and conforming with, laws and regulations in jurisdictions around the world may increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to adequately identify and address such compliance issues, we may face increased risks of government action against us, which could inhibit the development, growth and operation of our new businesses.\nIn particular, we will be subject to the laws and regulations of China in financial leasing and project finance, investment and asset management and blockchain areas, such as the Administrative Laws for Financial Leasing Enterprises Supervision, Guidelines for Acceleration of the Development of Financial Leasing Industry. There are no specific regulations in China regarding to the application of blockchain technology. Currently, our subsidiaries in China have received government approval for their businesses. Chain Cloud Mall logistics Center has approval from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (\u201cSAIC\u201d) to conduct business in the following areas: financial leasing; the purchase of assets domestically or internationally for leasing; leasing consultation and guarantee; and related services. Zhonglian Hengxin has approval from SAIC to conduct business in the following areas: asset management (except for financial, securities, futures and other restricted items); asset acquisition, asset disposal and asset operation (except for financial, securities, futures and other restricted items); planning and advisory for corporate restructure and merger and acquisition; equity and real estate investment (no public offerings, restricted to investment through assets of the company itself). GlobalKey Supply Chain has approval from SAIC to conduct business in the following areas: all types of commodities and technology import and export; sales of health products, food additives, pre-packed foods, fruit juice; dairy products (including infant formula) distribution; alcohol distribution; retail and sales of related products online; and software and hardware development and sales.\nOn September 4, 2017, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission jointly issued the rules of Prevention of Token Financing Risk, pursuant to which \u201cinitial coin offerings\u201d are defined as illegal financing activities without approval, involving illegal issuance of tokens and notes, illegal issuances of securities and illegal crowdfunding and financial fraud and pyramid sales. These rules require the cessation of token and cryptocurrency financing and refunds to the investors. Currently, the Chinese government has prohibited initial coin offerings in China, but the use of blockchain and its applications are not prohibited. Financing leasing companies are regulated by China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. The Company plans to issue and trade cryptocurrencies in the countries in which such businesses are allowed, such as Japan, and the software coding and structural design work will be done in China by Chinese technicians. On May 25, 2016, the Congress of Japan passed an Amendment to its Capital Settlement Law, which became effective on April 1, 2017. The law formally recognizes cryptocurrency as a lawful payment method and put it under legal system of Japan. DCON complies with this law. Currently, there are no cryptocurrency or blockchain laws or regulations in China, but the adoption, implementation and enforcement of any such laws and regulations could impede the development of our business lines, require increased operating costs associated with compliance, and negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe blockchain related products and services that we are developing have the potential to be used in ways we do not intend, including for criminal or other illegal activities.\nBlockchain-related products and services, in particular cryptocurrencies, have the potential to be used for financial crimes or other illegal activities. Because the blockchain platform that we are developing is novel, there are uncertainties regarding any legal and regulatory requirements for preventing blockchain-related products and services from being put to such uses, and there are uncertainties regarding the liabilities and risks to the Company if we are unable to prevent such uses. Even if we comply with all laws and regulations regarding financial and blockchain related products and services, we have no ability to ensure that our customers, partners or others to whom we license or sell our products and services comply with all laws and regulations applicable to them and their transactions.\nDCON uses what is called \u201ccold\u201d wallets for these accounts, which also have multiple signature requirements to protect the digital assets. mBTC uses the SHA256 algorithm, which by itself gives a high level of safety. A \u201ccold wallet\u201d is a wallet that is not connected to the internet. A user can store his or her crypto assets in a cold wallet if such user has no immediate plan to use those assets because it is safer than \u201chot wallet\u201d storage, which refers to a storage system that is connected to the internet and is potentially more vulnerable to hacking. Through the use of cold wallet technology, DCON can increase the safety of users\u2019 assets, which can be selectively moved to \u201chot wallets\u201d in preparation for specific transactions. Additionally, DCON requires real name registration for its cryptocurrency and each wallet and address can match a real person, i.e. a user must use his/her real name in order to use his/her wallet. User anonymity is an important property of the traditional blockchain system, which uses as its core premise absolutely free and anonymous exchanges. However, there are disadvantages related to user anonymity. For example, the loss of key records or hard drive failure may result in the loss of tens of millions of dollars in assets. Aiming to become a blockchain-based financial center, DCON will have real life business through its community stores, fund investment, mortgage loans, and similar products. Because these social and business activities involve risks and large amounts of capital, they should be conducted under a framework of regulatory and financial policies, which is a common theme in the worldwide financial system. Based on years of experience in the financial industry, DCON has cautiously chosen the real-name system described above to make sure, to the extent possible, that the assets of its users are protected and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Due to the nature of blockchain, all the assets on the blockchain can be tracked, traced and monitored. NRC uses real name registration and transaction information that can be traced, which reduces the risk of manipulation. The Shared Shopping Mall employs security measures common to blockchain technologies, such a multiple identity authentication and multi-signature requirements. The security measures to be employed by our blockchain projects currently in development have not yet been determined. There is no guarantee that these security measures or any that we may develop in the future will be effective.\nAny negative publicity we receive regarding any allegations of unlawful uses of our blockchain platform could damage our reputation. More generally, any negative publicity regarding unlawful uses of blockchain technology in the marketplace could reduce the demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nThe regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and offerings of digital assets is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development and the value of such cryptocurrencies and assets.\nRegulation of digital assets, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, cryptocurrency exchanges and the blockchain platform we are developing is currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them. Regulation also varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions, which may severely impact the permissibility of tokens generally and the technology behind them or the means of transaction or in transferring them. Failure by our subsidiaries to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.\nThe further development and acceptance of blockchain trading platforms, which are part of a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain trading platforms would have a material adverse effect on our business plans and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe growth of the blockchain industry in general is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the cryptocurrency and cryptosecurity industry, as well as blockchain trading platforms, include, without limitation:\n\u25cf worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies, cryptosecurities, and other blockchain technologies;\n\u25cf government and quasi-government regulation of cryptocurrencies, cryptosecurities, and other blockchain assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks or similar systems;\n\u25cf the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of cryptocurrency or cryptosecurities networks;\n\u25cf changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n\u25cf the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or trading assets including new means of using government-backed currencies or existing networks;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies and cryptosecurities; and\n\u25cf a decline in the popularity or acceptance of cryptocurrencies or other blockchain-based tokens.\nThe cryptocurrency and cryptosecurities industries as a whole have been characterized by rapid changes and innovations and are constantly evolving. Although it has experienced significant growth in recent years, the slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain networks and blockchain assets may materially adversely affect our business plans.\nIntellectual property infringement claims may adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs we develop and introduce new products, we may be increasingly subject to claims of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property. If a claim for infringement is brought against us, such claim may require us to modify our products, cease selling certain products or engage in litigation to determine the validity and scope of such claims. Any of these events may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf our costs and demands upon management increase disproportionately to the growth of our business and revenue as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs a public company, we do and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the stock exchange on which our Common Stock is traded. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically over the past several years. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs substantially and make some activities more time consuming and costly. If our costs and demands upon management increase disproportionately to the growth of our business and revenue, our operating results could be harmed.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenue, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the risk of increased income taxes, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by tax authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have retroactive effect. We currently operate through three direct wholly-owned subsidiaries: DigiPay FinTech Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, Digital Online Marketing Limited, a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and SkyPeople Foods Holding Limited, a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and their subsidiaries and VIE in Hong Kong, Japan, Cayman Islands and China, and we maintain manufacturing operations in China. Any of these jurisdictions could assert tax claims against us. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes. If we become subject to additional taxes in any jurisdiction, such tax treatment could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws that apply to our business could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the United States generate a significant portion of our income. In addition, the United States and many of the other countries in which our products are distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have recently made or are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJ Act\u201d) was recently signed into law in the United States. The changes in the TCJ Act are broad and complex and we are continuing to examine the impact the TCJ Act may have on our business and financial results.\nAdditional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in connection with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in the PRC\nInflation in the PRC could negatively affect our profitability and growth.\nThe rapid growth of China\u2019s economy has been uneven among economic sectors and geographic regions of the country. China\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 6.6% in 2018 as measured by the year-over-year change in gross domestic product, or GDP, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. The inflation rate in China was approximately 2.1% in 2018 as reported by National Bureau of Statistics, and is expected to increase. If prices for our products and services fail to rise at a rate sufficient to compensate for the increased costs of supplies, such as raw materials, due to inflation, it may have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nFurthermore, in order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for property, plant and equipment and restrictions on state bank lending. The implementation of such policies may impede future economic growth. If the central bank raises interest rates from current levels, economic activity in China could further slow and, in turn, materially increase our costs and reduce demand for our products and services.\nWe face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations and generate most of our revenue in the PRC. Accordingly, economic, political and legal developments in the PRC will significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The PRC economy is in transition from a planned economy to a market oriented economy subject to plans adopted by the government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on economic conditions in the PRC. While we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and that business development in the PRC will continue to follow market forces, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case. Our interests may be adversely affected by changes in policies by the PRC government, including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws, regulations or their interpretation;\n\u25cf confiscatory taxation;\n\u25cf restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies;\n\u25cf expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises; and\n\u25cf the allocation of resources.\nAlthough the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in the PRC through the allocation of resources, controlling payments of foreign currency, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries in different ways. We cannot guarantee that the PRC government will continue to pursue policies favoring a market oriented economy or that existing policies will not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting political, economic and social life in the PRC.\nThe original incorporation of SkyPeople (China) as a joint stock company in 2001 did not obtain all required approvals from the PRC government authorities pursuant to the relevant PRC law effective at the time, and we may be subject to various penalties under the law retroactively.\nThe original incorporation of SkyPeople (China) (under the original name of Xi\u2019an Zhonglv Ecology Science and Technology Industry Co., Ltd.) as a joint stock company in 2001 was approved by the Xi\u2019an Municipal People\u2019s Government. However, according to the applicable PRC Company Law that was in force in 2001, the incorporation of SkyPeople (China) as a joint stock company shall be subject to the approval by the government authority of Shaanxi Province. Pursuant to the PRC Company Law which was in force in 2001, if company stocks is arbitrarily issued without obtaining the approval of the relevant competent authorities stipulated under the law, the parties concerned may be ordered to cease the issuance of the stock, refund the raised capital and the interests accrued therefrom, and may be subject to a fine of no less than one percent but no more than five percent of the amount of the raised capital. As such, SkyPeople (China) may be subject to any or all of the foregoing penalties as provided under the PRC Company Law effective in 2001 should the relevant government authorities choose to enforce the law retroactively.\nHowever, we believe that the regulatory authorities may consider the following factors as mitigating factors if such authorities choose to enforce the applicable laws:\n(i) the incorporation of SkyPeople (China) obtained the approval by the Xi\u2019an local government. As general practice in approval procedures, the applicants may only be able to first approach the Xi\u2019an local government authority in order to acquire the approval by a higher level government authority, and would generally rely on the Xi\u2019an local government to then submit the application to a higher level authority for its final approval; and\n(ii) the trend of the PRC Company Law is to deregulate the approvals on the incorporation of joint stock companies in China. In particular, the current PRC Company Law, effective since January 1, 2006, has eliminated the relevant approval requirement relating to the incorporation of joint stock companies. Instead, the current PRC Company Law merely requires a registration with the competent Administration for Industry and Commerce in connection with the incorporation of joint stock companies in the PRC as long as the stock is not issued to the public.\nIn addition, if needed in the future, we may make efforts to seek a written confirmation from the Shaanxi Provencal People\u2019s Government regarding its ratification of the original incorporation of SkyPeople (China) as a joint stock company.\nOur current manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental protection laws and regulations issued by the central and local governmental authorities, and we cannot guarantee that we have fully complied with all such laws and regulations. In addition, changes in the existing laws and regulations or additional or stricter laws and regulations on environmental protection in the PRC may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with any such laws and regulations.\nWe carry out our juice business in an industry that is subject to PRC environmental protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require enterprises engaged in manufacturing and construction that may cause environmental waste to adopt effective measures to control and properly dispose of waste gases, waste water, industrial waste, dust and other environmental waste materials, as well as fee payments from producers discharging waste substances. Fines may be levied against producers causing pollution. Although we have made efforts to comply with such laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that we have fully complied with all such laws and regulations. Except for Yingkou, all of our operating facilities hold a Pollution Emission Permit. The failure of complying with such laws or regulations may subject us to various administrative penalties such as fines. If the circumstances of the breach are serious, the central government of the PRC, including all governmental subdivisions, has the discretion to cease or close any operations failing to comply with such laws or regulations. There can also be no assurance that the PRC government will not change the existing laws or regulations or impose additional or stricter laws or regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant capital expenditure, which we may be unable to pass on to our customers through higher prices for our products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with any such laws and regulations.\nChanges in existing PRC food hygiene and safety laws may cause us to incur additional costs to comply with the more stringent laws and regulations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position.\nManufacturers within the PRC beverage industry are subject to compliance with PRC food hygiene laws and regulations. These food hygiene and safety laws require all enterprises engaged in the production of juice and other beverages to obtain a food production license for each of their production facilities. They also set out hygiene and safety standards with respect to food and food additives, packaging and containers, information to be disclosed on packaging as well as hygiene requirements for food production and sites, facilities and equipment used for the transportation and sale of food. Failure to comply with PRC food hygiene and safety laws may result in fines, suspension of operations, loss of business licenses and, in more extreme cases, criminal proceedings against an enterprise and its management. Although we comply with current food hygiene laws, in the event that the PRC government increases the stringency of such laws, our production and distribution costs may increase, which could adversely impact our financial position.\nWe benefit from various forms of government subsidies and grants, the withdrawal of which could affect our operations.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have received government subsidies from local governments. We recognized $0.16 million and $0.19 million in government subsidies for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Past government grants or subsidies are not indicative of what we will obtain in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be eligible for government grants or other forms of government support. In the event that we are no longer eligible for grants, subsidies or other government support, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nPRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain and any changes in such laws and regulations may harm our business.\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business and the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in certain circumstances. We are considered foreign persons or foreign funded enterprises under PRC laws and, as a result, we are required to comply with PRC laws and regulations related to foreign persons and foreign funded enterprises. These laws and regulations are sometimes vague and may be subject to future changes, and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our business.\nWe could be restricted from paying dividends to shareholders due to PRC laws and other contractual requirements.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in the State of Florida and do not have any assets or conduct any business operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result of our holding company structure, we rely entirely on dividend payments from our subsidiaries in China. PRC accounting standards and regulations currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits, a portion of which is required to be set aside for certain reserve funds. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in China incur debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments. Although we do not intend to pay dividends in the future, our inability to receive all of the revenue from our Chines subsidiaries\u2019 operations may provide an additional obstacle to our ability to pay dividends if we so decide in the future.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of shareholder investments.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC. RMB is currently not a freely convertible currency. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to satisfy foreign currency obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from the transaction, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval by complying with certain procedural requirements. Approval from appropriate governmental authorities, however, is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the PRC government could restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay certain of our expenses as they come due.\nThe fluctuation of the RMB may harm shareholder investments.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenue and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would diminish the value of the proceeds of the offering and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the RMB, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the RMB we convert would be reduced. In addition, the depreciation of significant U.S. dollar denominated assets could result in a charge to our income statement and a reduction in the value of these assets.\nPRC regulations relating to mergers and the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents, if applied to us, may limit our ability to operate our business as we see fit.\nOn August 8, 2006, six Chinese regulatory agencies, namely, Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d), the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation (\u201cSAT\u201d), SAIC, the Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d), jointly promulgated the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, generally referred to as the 2006 M&A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006. The 2006 M&A Rules, among other things, govern the approval process by which an offshore investor may participate in an acquisition of assets or equity interests of a Chinese domestic company. Depending on the structure of the transaction, the 2006 M&A Rules require the transaction parties to make a series of applications to the government agencies. In some instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction. Under certain circumstances, government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies. Compliance with the 2006 M&A Rules will be more time consuming and expensive than in the past, and the government can exert more control over the combination of two businesses under the 2006 M&A Rules. As a result of any potential application of the 2006 M&A Rules, our ability to engage in business combination transactions in the PRC has become significantly more complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to us or sufficiently protective of our interests in a transaction.\nIn October 2005, SAFE issued the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside the PRC, generally referred to as Circular 75. Circular 75 requires Chinese residents to register with an applicable branch of SAFE before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose company for the purpose of engaging in an equity financing outside of the PRC that is supported by domestic Chinese assets originally held by those residents. Following the issuance of Circular 75, SAFE issued internal implementing guidelines for Circular 75 in June 2007. These implementing guidelines, known as Notice 106, effectively expanded the reach of Circular 75 by:\n\u25cf purporting to regulate the establishment or acquisition of control by Chinese residents of offshore entities which merely acquire \u201ccontrol\u201d over domestic companies or assets, even in the absence of legal ownership;\n\u25cf adding requirements relating to the source of the Chinese resident\u2019s funds used to establish or acquire the offshore entity;\n\u25cf regulating the use of existing offshore entities for offshore financings;\n\u25cf purporting to regulate situations in which an offshore entity establishes a new subsidiary in the PRC or acquires an unrelated company or unrelated assets in the PRC;\n\u25cf making the domestic affiliate of the offshore entity responsible for the accuracy of certain documents which must be filed in connection with any such registration, notably, the business plan which describes the overseas financing and the use of proceeds; and\n\u25cf requiring that the registrant establish that all foreign exchange transactions undertaken by the offshore entity and its affiliates were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nIn July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on the Administration of Foreign Exchange Involved in Overseas Investment, Financing and Return on Investment Conducted by Residents in China via Special-Purpose Companies, or Circular 37, which replaced the former circular commonly known as Circular 75 promulgated by SAFE in October 2005. Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as an increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls.\nIn February 2015, SAFE released the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Simplifying and Improving the Policies of Foreign Exchange Administration Applicable to Direct Investment, or Circular 13, which has amended Circular 37 by requiring PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks rather than SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.\nNo assurance can be given that our shareholders who are the residents as defined in Circular 37 and who own or owned our shares have fully complied with, and will continue to comply with, all applicable registration and approval requirements of Circular 37 in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisition of equity interests in our PRC based subsidiaries by virtue of our acquisition of Pacific. Moreover, because of uncertainty over how Circular 37 will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us following the Pacific acquisition, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, the ability of our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 37 by our Chinese resident beneficial holders. In addition, such Chinese residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 37. We have little control over our present or prospective direct or indirect shareholders /beneficial owners or the outcome of such registration procedures. If our Chinese shareholders/beneficial owners or the Chinese shareholders/beneficial owners of the target companies we acquired in the past or will acquire in the future fail to comply with Circular 37 and related regulations, and if SAFE requires it, they may be subject to fines or legal sanctions, and Chinese authorities could restrict our investment activities in the PRC, limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions or pay dividends, or affect the ownership structure, which could adversely affect business and prospects.\nOur acquisition of SkyPeople (China) could constitute a Round-trip Investment under the 2006 M&A Rules.\nPrior to obtaining the MOFCOM approval on September 3, 2007 and Xi\u2019an AIC approval on October 18, 2007, and prior to the full payment of the purchase price by Pacific for 99% of SkyPeople (China)\u2019s capital stock, SkyPeople (China) was a PRC business some of whose shareholders were PRC individuals including Hongke Xue, chairman of SkyPeople (China). When Pacific was incorporated on November 30, 2006 and when the SkyPeople (China) acquisition was approved, none of the shareholders of Pacific were PRC citizens. Immediately after the consummation of the share exchange, shareholders of Pacific became our shareholders, including Fancylight, our controlling shareholder. To incentivize Mr. Hongke Xue in connection with the continuous development of SkyPeople (China)\u2019s business, a call option agreement was entered into between Fancylight and Mr. Hongke Xue on February 25, 2008 pursuant to which Mr. Xue had the opportunity to acquire a majority of our Common Stock held by Fancylight. Mr. Xue and Fancylight also entered into a voting trust agreement pursuant to which Mr. Xue has the right to vote such shares on Fancylight\u2019s behalf.\nThe PRC regulatory authorities may take the view that the SkyPeople (China) acquisition, the share exchange transaction and the call option and voting trust arrangements are part of an overall series of arrangements which constitute a round-trip investment regulated by the 2006 M&A Rules, because at the end of these transactions the same PRC individual who controlled SkyPeople (China) became the effective controlling party of a foreign entity that acquired ownership of SkyPeople (China). The PRC regulatory authorities may also take the view that the approval of the SkyPeople (China) acquisition by the MOFCOM and the registration of such acquisition with the AIC in Xi\u2019an AIC may not be evidence that the SkyPeople (China) acquisition has been properly approved because the relevant parties did not fully disclose to the MOFCOM or AIC the overall restructuring arrangements. If the PRC regulatory authorities take the view that the SkyPeople (China) acquisition constitutes a round-trip investment under the 2006 M&A Rules, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the required MOFCOM approval.\nIf the PRC regulatory authorities take the view that the SkyPeople (China) acquisition constitutes a round-trip investment without MOFCOM approval on such round-trip investment, they could invalidate our acquisition and ownership of SkyPeople (China).\nAdditionally, the 2006 M&A Rules also purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle (\u201d SPV\u201d) formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals shall obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV\u2019s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by SPVs seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings. However, the application of this PRC regulation remains unclear, with no consensus currently existing regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement. Given that we established our PRC subsidiaries by means of direct investments, we believe that these regulations do not require an application to be submitted to the CSRC for the approval of the listing and trading of our stock on the NASDAQ, unless we are clearly required to do so by subsequently promulgated rules of the CSRC. If the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that CSRC approval was required for the offerings, we may need to apply for a remedial approval from the CSRC and may be subject to certain administrative punishments or other sanctions from these regulatory agencies. The regulatory agencies may take actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our stock.\nWe believe that if this takes place, we may be able to find a way to reestablish control of SkyPeople (China)\u2019s business operations through a series of contractual arrangements rather than an outright purchase of SkyPeople (China). But we cannot guarantee that such contractual arrangements will be protected by PRC law or that we can receive as complete or effective economic benefit and overall control of SkyPeople (China)\u2019s business than if we had direct ownership of SkyPeople (China). In addition, we cannot guarantee that such contractual arrangements can be successfully implemented under PRC law. If we cannot obtain approval from MOFCOM and/or CSRC if required by the PRC regulatory authorities to do so, and if we cannot put in place or enforce relevant contractual arrangements as an alternative and equivalent means of control of SkyPeople (China), our business and financial performance will be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our principal assets are located outside of the United States, it may be difficult for investors to use U.S. securities laws to enforce their rights against us, our officers and some of our directors in the United States or to enforce judgments of United States courts against us or them in the PRC.\nAll of our present officers and directors reside outside of the United States. In addition, all of our subsidiaries and assets are located outside of the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws against us in the courts of either the United States or the PRC and, even if civil judgments are obtained in courts of the United States, to enforce such judgments in the PRC courts. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement against us or our officers and directors of criminal penalties under the U.S. Federal securities laws or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe are authorized to issue blank check preferred stock, which may be issued without shareholder approval and which may adversely affect the rights of holders of our Common Stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board is authorized under our articles of incorporation, as amended, to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock by resolution and by filing a certificate of designations under Florida law, to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series of preferred stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The Board previously designated and issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock which were automatically converted into our Common Stock upon the effective date of our two-for-three reverse split and returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock following the reverse split. As of December 31, 2018 there were no shares of Series A preferred stock issued and outstanding. Any shares of preferred stock that are issued are likely to have priority over our Common Stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be utilized under certain circumstances as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control, which could have the effect of discouraging bids to acquire us and thereby prevent shareholders from receiving the maximum value for their shares. We have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock in order to discourage or delay a change of control or for any other reason. However, there can be no assurance that preferred stock will not be issued at some time in the future.\nZeyao Xue has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a substantial amount of our voting stock.\nZeyao Xue, the son of our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, indirectly and directly beneficially owns 13,034,114 shares, or approximately 40.3%, of our outstanding common stock as of the date of this report. Mr. Zeyao Xue\u2019s beneficial ownership of 40.3% of Future FinTech\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock will give him the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to shareholders for approval, including but not limited to the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets that other shareholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that other shareholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring the common stock of the Company due to the limited voting power of such shares. As a shareholder, even a controlling shareholder, Mr. Zeyao Xue is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our shareholders generally.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Florida law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company and may affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe are a Florida corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act may discourage, delay or prevent certain changes in control unless such change in control is approved by a majority of our disinterested shareholders. In addition, the terms of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that shareholders may consider favorable.

The Determination Letter further noted that unless the Company requested an appeal of the Staff\u2019s determination no later than 4:00 pm Eastern Time on October 19, 2016, trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market would be suspended at the opening of business on October 21, 2016, and a Form 25-NSE would be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) removing the Company\u2019s securities from listing and registration on the NASDAQ Global Market.\nOn October 19, 2016, the Company requested a hearing before the NASDAQ Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d) under Listing Rule 5815(a) to appeal the delisting determination from the Staff. On November 2, 2016, the Company was granted an extended stay as to the suspension of the Company\u2019s shares from trading by the Panel until the Company\u2019s scheduled hearing before the Panel on December 15, 2016 and issuance of a final Panel decision. Following a hearing, the Panel required that the Company regain compliance by January 31, 2017. By letter dated February 2, 2017, the Panel notified the Company that (i) the Company had regained compliance, (ii) the Company\u2019s Common Stock would continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, and (iii) the Panel was closing the matter.\nOn December 1, 2017, the Company received written notice from NASDAQ stating that the Company was not in compliance with the requirement of the minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (\u201cMVPHS\u201d) of $5,000,000 for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(C). The notice had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company\u2019s common stock, and its common stock continued to trade on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \u201cFTFT\u201d. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D), the Company had a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until May 30, 2018, to regain compliance with the minimum MVPHS requirement. To regain compliance, the minimum MVPHS of the Company\u2019s common stock needed to meet or exceed $5,000,000 for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180-day grace period. The Company received notice that it had regained compliance on January 4, 2018.\nOn January 4, 2018, the Company received a written notification from the NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Qualifications staff indicating that the Company had regained compliance with the minimum market value of publicly held shares (\u201cMVPHS\u201d) of $5,000,000 requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Market pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(C) (the \u201cMVPHS Requirement\u201d) and that the matter was now closed. The minimum market value of publicly held shares of the Company\u2019s common stock had been at $5,000,000 or greater for at least 10 consecutive business days. Accordingly, the Company had regained compliance with the MVPHS Requirement.\nOn November 26, 2018, the Company received written notice from the NASDAQ Stock Market stating that the Company was not in compliance with the requirement of maintaining a minimum of $10,000,000 in stockholders\u2019 equity for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(A). The notice had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company\u2019s common stock, and its common stock continued to trade on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \u201cFTFT\u201d. Under NASDAQ Rules, the Company had 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance. If the plan were accepted, NASDAQ could grant the Company an extension up to 180 calendars from the date of the NASDAQ letter. Alternatively, the Company could consider applying to transfer the Company\u2019s securities to the NASDAQ Capital Market, which has a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement of $2,500,000.\nOn December 28, 2018, the Company received confirmation from the Nasdaq Stock Market that its application to transfer the listing of its common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market (the \u201cCapital Market\u201d) had been approved. The Company\u2019s common stock began trading on the Capital Market on December 31, 2018.\nOn February 28, 2019, the Company received a letter from NASDAQ notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock listed on NASDAQ was below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, the Company no longer met the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on NASDAQ under NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d). The notification had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company\u2019s common stock. In accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had a period of 180 calendar days from the date of notification, until August 27, 2019 (the \u201cCompliance Period\u201d), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any time before the expiration of the Compliance Period the bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock closed at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ would provide written notification that the Company had achieved compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If the Company did not regain compliance by the end of the Compliance Period, the Company may have been eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the NASDAQ Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and would need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. However, if it appeared to NASDAQ that the Company would not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company were otherwise not eligible, NASDAQ would provide notice that the Company\u2019s securities were subject to delisting.\nOn May 7, 2019, the Company received a written notification from the NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Qualifications Staff indicating that the Company has regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d) and that the matter is now closed. The closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been at $1.00 per share or greater for at least 10 consecutive business days. Accordingly, the Company has regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On May 8, 2019, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company has regained compliance with Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nOn April 17, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from NASDAQ stating the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), due to its failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the \u201c2018 10-K\u201d). The NASDAQ notification letter provided the Company 60 calendar days from the date of the notification, or until June 17, 2019, to submit a plan to NASDAQ to regain compliance with the NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements. If the plan were accepted, NASDAQ could grant an exception of up to 180 calendar days, or until October 14, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance. The Company may regain compliance at any time during this 180-day period upon filing its 2018 10-K, as well as all subsequent required periodic reports that are due within that period. If NASDAQ did not accept the Company\u2019s compliance plan, the Company would have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a Hearing Panel under Listing Rule 5815(a).\nOn May 21, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from NASDAQ stating the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), due to its failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and its remaining delinquent in the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the \u201cInitial Delinquent Filing\u201d). The NASDAQ notification letter provided the Company until June 17, 2019, to submit a plan to NASDAQ to regain compliance with the NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements. If the plan were accepted, NASDAQ could grant an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Initial Delinquent Filing, or until October 14, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance. If NASDAQ did not accept the Company\u2019s compliance plan, the Company would have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a Hearing Panel under Listing Rule 5815(a).\nOn June 14, 2019, the Company submitted its plan of compliance in connection with its failure to timely file the annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2018 and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2019 (the \u201cDelinquent Filings\u201d) to NASDAQ. In a notification letter dated July 29, 2019, NASDAQ granted the Company an exception until August 31, 2019 to file its delinquent Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2018 and until September 30, 2019 to file the Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2019, based upon the initial plans of compliance submitted by the Company to NASDAQ.", "PERMNO": 93069, "SIC": 2080, "TIC": "FTFT"}
