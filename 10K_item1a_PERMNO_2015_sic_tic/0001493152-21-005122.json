RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in our securities. These risk factors are effective as of the date of this Form 10-K and shall be deemed to be modified or superseded to the extent that a statement contained in our future filings modifies or replaces such statement. All of these risks may impair our business operations. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the results we discuss in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe below summary of risk factors provides an overview of many of the risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. As a result, the below summary risks do not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the summary risks together with the more detailed discussion of risks set forth following this section as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report. Additional risks, beyond those summarized below or discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, may apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted or as we may conduct them in the future or in the markets in which we operate or may in the future operate. Consistent with the foregoing, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including risks associated with the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u25cf We have incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to continue to experience losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u25cf We will need to raise additional capital in the future to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates and operate our business.\n\u25cf We were denied funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (\u201cBARDA\u201d) and we may be unable to win any government contracts, grants, agreement or other funding in the future. Even if we are successful in obtaining such contracts, grants, agreements or other funding, we cannot assure the success of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, that it will be approved by the FDA or other public health regulatory authority or that any funding provided will be sufficient to complete development and successful commercialization.\n\u25cf We may rely on government funding and collaboration with government entities for our vaccine development, which adds uncertainty to our research and development efforts and may impose requirements that increase the costs of development, commercialization and production of any programs developed under those government-funded programs.\n\u25cf We have limited vaccine-specific research, development, manufacturing, testing, regulatory, commercialization, sales, distribution, and marketing experience, and we may need to invest significant financial and management resources to establish these capabilities. Despite such investments and our best efforts, our strategic acquisition of Noachis Terra may turn out to be unsuccessful.\n\u25cf We have limited financial resources and we may not be able to maintain our current level of operations or be able to fund the further development of our new Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate.\n\u25cf Our vaccine product candidate is at the preclinical stage and has not been approved for sale. We have not conducted substantial research and development for a vaccine product candidate, and we may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully prevents the virus in a timely and economical manner, if at all.\n\u25cfThe market opportunities for our vaccine product candidate may be smaller than we believe them to be. Moreover, any pandemic threat may abate, or alternative vaccines currently being broadly disseminated under the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization could become widely accepted and adopted before our vaccines achieve regulatory approval.\n\u25cf If we are unable to successfully develop our product candidates, our operating results and competitive position could be harmed. Research and development involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be successful in our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates. The further development and ultimate commercialization of product candidates for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, as well as our other product candidates, are keys to our growth strategy.\n\u25cf If we are successful in producing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, we may need to devote significant resources to its scale-up and development, including for use by the U.S. government or other foreign authorities. Moreover, government involvement may limit the commercial success of our vaccine product candidate.\n\u25cf Our product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to compete effectively may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration.\n\u25cf Because our vaccine product development efforts depend on new and rapidly evolving technologies, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be successful.\n\u25cf Our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway.\n\u25cf We may be unable to refine a method to produce MU1140 homologs in large-scale commercial quantities. If we cannot, we will be unable to generate significant revenues from sales of our MU1140 homologs product candidate.\n\u25cf Our success will depend on our ability to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidate under our Lantibiotics Program and its successful commercialization.\n\u25cf We may choose not to continue developing or commercializing any of our product candidates at any time during development or after approval, which would reduce or eliminate our potential return on investment for those product candidates.\n\u25cf We have limited experience in the conduct of clinical trials. We have never initiated a vaccine-related clinical trial. We have never obtained approval of any product candidates. We may be unable to undertake any of those actions successfully.\n\u25cf We cannot assure you that the market and consumers will accept our products or product candidates. If they do not, we will be unable to generate significant revenues from our products or product candidates and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\n\u25cf Failure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\n\u25cf We will need to further increase the size and complexity of our organization in the future, and we may experience difficulties in executing our growth strategy and managing our growth.\n\u25cf If our manufacturers and suppliers in general fail to meet our requirements and the requirements of regulatory authorities, our research and development may be materially adversely affected.\n\u25cf We rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of our senior management and scientific team and the loss of any of our key personnel or our inability to successfully hire their successors could harm our business.\n\u25cf We need to hire and retain additional qualified scientists and other highly skilled personnel to maintain and grow our business.\n\u25cf If any of our product candidates are shown to be ineffective or harmful in humans, we will be unable to generate revenues from these product candidates.\n\u25cf Because we are new to vaccine development, we must identify vaccines for development with our technologies and establish successful third-party relationships.\n\u25cf We intend to seek licensing partners to cover a portion of the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approval for, and manufacturing and marketing of, our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain agreements with third parties to fund these costs, we will have to fund such costs ourselves or we may be unable to extract any value from these technologies.\n\u25cf We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.\n\u25cf We may face product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\n\u25cf We may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\n\u25cf Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited, each of which could harm our business.\n\u25cf Our auditor has previously expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and absent additional financing we may be unable to remain a going concern.\nRisks Related to Our Licenses, Intellectual Property and Data Security and Privacy\n\u25cf Our vaccine research and development efforts are to a large extent dependent upon our intellectual property and biologicals materials license with the NIAID and the NIH.\n\u25cf We may incur additional expenses and obligations in connection our NIH license.\n\u25cf The intellectual property covered by our NIH license concerns patent applications and provisional applications. We cannot assure investors that any of the currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents, nor can we predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted.\n\u25cf We cannot prevent the NIH or other companies, including our competitors, from licensing the same intellectual property and biological materials that we have licensed or from otherwise duplicating our business model and operations.\n\u25cf Our Lantibiotic Development program development efforts are to a large extent dependent upon our intellectual property and exclusive channel collaboration agreement with Eleszto Genetika, Inc. (\u201cEGI\u201d) and is based on early-stage technology in its field.\n\u25cf We will incur additional expenses in connection with our exclusive channel collaboration arrangement.\n\u25cf We may not be able to retain the exclusive rights licensed to us under our Lantibiotic ECC to develop and commercialize lantibiotic products.\n\u25cf Our Collaboration Partner, EGI, may not devote sufficient time and resources to successfully carry out their contracted duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to advance our product candidates in a timely manner or at all.\n\u25cf We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\n\u25cf Changes in patent law or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\n\u25cf If we are unable to protect our trademarks or other intellectual property from infringement, our business prospects may be harmed.\n\u25cf We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n\u25cf If we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property license agreements, we could lose our license rights that are important to our business and development of our product candidates.\n\u25cf If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time-consuming and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming.\n\u25cf Our success will depend on our ability to partner or sub-license our product candidates and their subsequent successful commercialization.\n\u25cf If our intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products or product candidates, or if third parties claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights, others could compete against us more directly or we could be subject to significant litigation. Such results could prevent us from marketing our products or product candidates and hurt our profitability.\n\u25cf Our business and operations would suffer in the event of cybersecurity/information systems risk.\n\u25cf We may incur costs of addressing a cybersecurity incident.\n\u25cf Our business and operations would suffer in the event of failures in our internal computer systems or those of our collaborators.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\n\u25cf Our product candidates are subject to substantial government regulation, including the regulation of nonclinical testing and clinical trials. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to generate revenues.\n\u25cf We may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, or other early-stage product candidates under applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates. The delay, limitation or denial of any regulatory approval would adversely impact commercialization, our potential to generate revenue, our business and our operating results.\n\u25cf Delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials may result in additional costs and delays in our ability to generate significant revenues, and may delay or prevent our receipt of any regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our planned and future products.\n\u25cf Any product candidates that we commercialize will be subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review.\n\u25cf Our product candidates may cause serious or undesirable side effects or possess other unexpected properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of approved labeling or result in post-approval regulatory action.\n\u25cf If any of our product candidates are approved for marketing and we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, or if physicians misuse our products or use our products off-label, we may become subject to prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, product liability claims and significant fines, penalties and sanctions, and our brand and reputation could be harmed.\n\u25cf We may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf Our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors and CROs may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\n\u25cf Even if our current product candidates or any future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the broad degree of health care payers, physician and patient adoption and use necessary for commercial success.\n\u25cf If we are unable to achieve and maintain coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, or any future products we may seek to commercialize, their commercial success may be severely hindered.\n\u25cf If our products do not receive favorable third-party reimbursement, or if new restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not generate significant revenues.\nRisks Related to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)\n\u25cf Our business is subject to risks arising from public health crises, epidemic or pandemic diseases, such as the recent global outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n\u25cf Our ability to conduct clinical trials may be impeded, delayed, limited or prevented entirely due to the spread of COVID-19, the imposition of government restrictions and the concurrent disruptions to ordinary business activities globally.\n\u25cf Our business involves international components, and we are exposed to various global and local risks related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, the effectives of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may alter the ways in which we conduct our business operations and manage our financial capacities.\n\u25cf Economic uncertainty may adversely affect our access to capital, cost of capital and ability to execute our business plan as scheduled.\n\u25cf Inadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies in light of the coronavirus pandemic could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u25cf The issuance of additional equity securities by us in the future would result in dilution to our existing common shareholders.\n\u25cf Our financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\n\u25cf Our Series A and Series B preferred stock, if not converted into common stock, has a distribution and liquidation preference senior to our common stock in liquidation which could negatively affect the value of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital.\n\u25cf The conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, and Series B Preferred Stock and the exercise of currently outstanding warrants could result in significant dilution to the holders of our common stock.\n\u25cf Our stockholders may not realize a benefit from our acquisition of Noachis Terra commensurate with the ownership dilution experienced in connection with the acquisition.\n\u25cf Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws, executive employment agreements and stock option plan may prevent a change of control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable.\n\u25cf The price and volume of our common stock has been volatile and fluctuates substantially, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\n\u25cf We may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\n\u25cf Future sales or issuances of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception of such sales, could depress the trading price of our common stock.\n\u25cf The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified members for our Board of Directors.\n\u25cf If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud which could subject us to regulatory sanctions, harm our business and operating results and cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\n\u25cf We will continue to incur significant costs as a result of and devote substantial management time to operating as a public company listed on the NYSE American.\n\u25cf We will continue to incur significant costs as a result of and devote substantial management time to operating as a public company listed on the NYSE American.\n\u25cf If securities or industry analysts publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n\u25cf We may issue debt or debt securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\n\u25cf We are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\n\u25cf We have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to continue to experience losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow in each year since our inception, including net losses of approximately $26.4 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit was approximately $154.4 million. We have devoted a significant amount of our financial resources to research and development, including our nonclinical development activities and clinical trials, as well as licensing and acquisitions related to our product candidates. We expect that the costs associated with our plans to begin preclinical research, contract manufacturing and file an IND for our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate and the research and development of our product candidates pursuant to our exclusive channel partnerships with Eleszto Genetika, Inc. in the area of lantibiotics (\u201cLantibiotics Program\u201d) will continue to increase the level of our overall expenses significantly going forward. Additionally, our NIH license also requires the payment of certain recurring and performance-based royalties that may negatively impact our financial capabilities. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. These losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our shareholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of substantial expenses or when, or if, we will be able to generate the revenue necessary to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in the future to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates and operate our business.\nDeveloping and commercializing biopharmaceutical products, including conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials and establishing manufacturing capabilities, is expensive, and the progress of our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates, including our acquisition of a vaccine product candidate, can cause us to use our limited, available capital resources faster than we currently anticipate. Our actual costs may ultimately vary from our current expectations, which could materially impact our use of capital and our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations. Our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are not sufficient to fully implement our business strategy and sustain our operations beyond the second quarter of 2022. Accordingly, we will need to seek additional sources of financing and such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate or government collaboration and licensing arrangements. If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to complete existing nonclinical and planned clinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. We expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure, and research and development activities. Specifically, we need to raise additional capital to, among other things:\n\u25cf conduct preclinical research for our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, file an IND with the FDA and, if approved, engage in Phase 1 clinical trial and commence preparation for Phase 2 clinical trials;\n\u25cf engage in GMP and non-GMP manufacturing for our product candidates at the preclinical research and clinical trial stages;\n\u25cf expand our clinical laboratory operations;\n\u25cf fund our clinical validation study activities;\n\u25cf expand our research and development activities; and\n\u25cf finance our capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the current and continued microeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability, the ability of our third-party contractors and suppliers, and the ability of government regulators to conduct ordinary business operations in a timely and efficient manner, as well as the pandemic\u2019s broader, macroeconomic impact on the U.S., foreign and global economic markets;\n\u25cf the level of research and development investment budgeted to develop our current and future product candidates;\n\u25cf costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf our need or decision to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;\n\u25cf changes in test development plans needed to address any difficulties in product candidate selection for commercialization;\n\u25cf competing technological and market developments;\n\u25cf our interaction and relationship with the FDA, or other, regulatory agencies; and\n\u25cf changes in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations.\nAdditional capital may not be available on satisfactory terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our existing stockholders would result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or our products under development, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to scale back our operations or limit our research and development activities, which may cause us to grow at a slower pace, or not at all, and our business could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, and/or forego licensing attractive business opportunities.\nWe were denied funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (\u201cBARDA\u201d) and we may be unable to win any government contracts, grants, agreement or other funding in the future. Even if we are successful in obtaining such contracts, grants, agreements or other funding, we cannot assure the success of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, that it will be approved by the FDA or other public health regulatory authority or that any funding provided will be sufficient to complete development and successful commercialization.\nFrom time to time, we may apply for contracts, grants, agreements or other funding from government agencies, academic institutions and non-profit organizations. Such contracts or grants can be highly attractive because they provide capital to fund the ongoing development of our technologies and vaccine candidates without diluting our stockholders. However, significant competition exists for these contracts, grants, agreements or other funding. Entities offering such contracts, grants, agreements or other funding may have requirements to apply for or to otherwise be eligible to receive such contracts, grants, agreements or other funding that our competitors may be able to satisfy that we cannot. In addition, such entities have limited funding available to award and may make arbitrary decisions as to whether to offer contracts or make grants, to whom the contracts or grants will be awarded and the size of the contracts or grants to each awardee. Even if we are able to satisfy the award requirements, we may not be a successful awardee. Therefore, we may not be able to win any contracts or grants in a timely manner, if at all. For example, we applied for BARDA funding in connection with our license with the NIH and received notification that are request for BARDA funding had been denied.\nEven if we receive a financing through one of the aforementioned mechanisms, the success of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate cannot be assured solely by our ability to obtain such financing, nor can it assure that any vaccine product candidate so financed will succeed in clinical trials and receive regulatory approval from the FDA or other public health regulatory authorities. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that our receipt of such financing will obviate the need for future financial resources to support the further development of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, as additional development activities may be needed, and the vaccine approval and development process can be costly and unpredictable. We have no control over the resources and funding that government agencies may devote to these agreements, which may be subject to annual renewal and which generally may be terminated by the government agencies at any time. Accordingly, our receipt of such funding cannot be relied upon solely as an indicator or guarantee of the success of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate.\nWe may rely on government funding and collaboration with government entities for our vaccine development, which adds uncertainty to our research and development efforts and may impose requirements that increase the costs of development, commercialization and production of any programs developed under those government-funded programs.\nBecause we anticipate the resources necessary to develop our new Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate will be substantial, we may explore funding and development collaboration opportunities with the U.S. government and its agencies. For example, we may continue to apply for certain grant funding from BARDA, the NIH or other government agencies to further the research, development, manufacture, testing, and regulatory approval of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate. We have no control or input over whether an application for BARDA grant funding or any other funding will be accepted or approved, in full or in part, and we cannot provide investors with any assurances that we will receive such funding.\nSimilar to the requirements imposed by our new NIH license, contracts and grants funded by the U.S. government and its agencies, contain provisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u25cf reduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u25cf claim rights, including IP rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u25cf audit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u25cf suspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations.\n\u25cf impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u25cf suspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government;\n\u25cf control and potentially prohibit the export of products;\n\u25cf pursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act, and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n\u25cf limit the government\u2019s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\nIn addition, government contracts and grants, ordinarily contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions, including the following:\n\u25cf specialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants;\n\u25cf mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u25cf public disclosures of certain contract and grant information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u25cf mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination, and affirmative action programs, and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we received such grants or agreements, we may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third-parties, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. Further, under such agreements we could be subject to obligations to and the rights of the U.S. government set forth in the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, meaning the U.S. government may have rights in certain inventions developed under these government-funded agreements, including a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government could have the right to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or nonexclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations, also referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights.\u201d Although the U.S. government\u2019s historic restraint with respect to these rights indicates they are unlikely to be used, any exercise of the march-in rights could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In the event we would be subject to the U.S. government\u2019s exercise such march-in rights, we may receive compensation that is deemed reasonable by the U.S. government in its sole discretion, which may be less than what we might be able to obtain in the open market.\nAdditionally, as is the case under our new NIH license, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying any invention generated through the use of U.S. government funding be manufactured substantially in the United States. The manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for U.S. manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property.\nAlthough we will need to comply with some of these obligations in relation to our NIH license, not all of the aforementioned obligations may be applicable to us unless and only to the extent that we receive a government grant, contract or other agreement. However, as an organization, we are relatively new to government contracting and new to the regulatory compliance obligations that such contracting entails. If we were to fail to maintain compliance with those obligations, we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts, including the NIH license, which may have a materially adverse effect on our ability to develop our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate.\nWe have limited vaccine-specific research, development, manufacturing, testing, regulatory, commercialization, sales, distribution, and marketing experience, and we may need to invest significant financial and management resources to establish these capabilities. Despite such investments and our best efforts, our strategic acquisition of Noachis Terra may turn out to be unsuccessful.\nAs part of our business strategy, we monitor and analyze strategic acquisition opportunities that we believe will be strategic fits for the Company and beneficial to the Company\u2019s shareholders. As demonstrated by our acquisition of Noachis Terra, we may acquire companies, businesses, products and technologies that complement, augment or transform our existing business. However, such acquisitions could involve numerous risks that may prevent us from fully realizing the benefits that we anticipated as a result of such transactions.\nPrior to our acquisition of Noachis Terra, we had little-to-no experience in the development and commercialization of vaccines. Although, in connection with the acquisition, we added experienced vaccine researchers and consultants and appointed an experienced vaccine industry professional to our board of directors, given our size and current stage of development, we still have limited vaccine-specific research, development, manufacturing, testing, regulatory, commercialization, sales, distribution, and marketing experience. To successfully develop our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, we will need to dedicate significant amounts of our limited financial and management resources to bolster our expertise in this area. Our success depends significantly on the continued contributions of our executive officers, financial, scientific and technical personnel and consultants, and on our ability to attract additional personnel.\nDuring our operating history, many essential responsibilities have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals, and we currently depend heavily upon the efforts and abilities of our management team. However, as we advance into vaccine development, the demands on our key employees will expand and we will need to recruit additional qualified employees for our Company. The competition for such qualified personnel is intense, particularly in light of the demand for a vaccine or other treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and/or COVID-19. The loss of services of any of our existing consultants or our inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions could adversely affect our ability to efficiently develop our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate. The loss or unavailability of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results.\nAlternatively, or in addition to the above, we may enter into strategic alliances or partnership with other vaccine industry entities to utilize their research, development, manufacturing testing, regulatory or commercialization skills, but we may be unable to enter into such agreements on favorable terms, if at all. If our future strategic collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to our alliances or partnerships and the progress of our vaccine development, if any, and we are unable to develop the necessary capabilities on our own, we may be unable to advance the development of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate to the point of commercialization, even if we obtain regulatory approval. We will be competing with many companies that currently have existing, extensive and well-funded operations, and without a significant internal team or the support of a third party to perform essential functions related to vaccine research, development, manufacturing, testing, regulatory approval, and commercialization, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies and our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate may fail.\nAny failure by us to effectively limit such risks as we implement our strategic acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cause the price of our securities to fall.\nWe have limited financial resources and we may not be able to maintain our current level of operations or be able to fund the further development of our new Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate.\nTo date, Oragenics has never developed a vaccine product candidate, and we cannot assure investors that we will be able to successfully develop a vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 with our current resources and capabilities. Because our new Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate is in early stages of development, it will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing, and we will need significant additional funding to conduct such research and testing. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales, licensing fees, royalties, milestones, contract research or other sources in amounts sufficient to fully fund our operations for the foreseeable future, and we will therefore use our cash resources, and expect to require additional funds, to maintain our existing operations, continue our research and development programs, commence future preclinical studies and clinical trials for our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, and to seek regulatory approvals.\nWe anticipate seeking such additional funds through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings, as well as potential collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements and non-dilutive funding from government and nongovernment funding entities, as well as other sources to further the research, development, manufacturing, testing, and regulatory approval of vaccine product candidates. While we may continue to apply for contracts or grants from academic institutions, nonprofit organizations and governmental entities, we may not be successful. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we cannot raise the additional funds required for our anticipated operations or to support our development efforts, we may be required to delay significantly, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, downsize our organization, or seek alternative measures to avoid insolvency, including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or our vaccine candidate. If we raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock or other debt or equity securities, such offerings would cause dilution of current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in the Company, which could be substantial. Additionally, future offerings also could have a material and adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur vaccine product candidate is at the preclinical stage and has not been approved for sale. We have not conducted substantial research and development for a vaccine product candidate, and we may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully prevents the virus in a timely and economical manner, if at all.\nOur Terra CoV-2 vaccine development program is in the early stages of research and development, and currently includes only one product candidate, which is in the preclinical stage. Limited data exist regarding the safety and efficacy of our vaccine product candidate, and we must conduct a substantial amount of additional research, development and clinical testing before any regulatory authority will approve our vaccine product candidate. The success of our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates could fail for a number of reasons. For example, we could experience delays in product development and clinical trials or unsatisfactory clinical trial results.\nIn addition, adverse events, or the perception of adverse events, relating to vaccine product candidates and delivery technologies may negatively impact our ability to develop commercially successful products. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been subject to claims that the use of some pediatric vaccines has caused personal injuries, including brain damage, central nervous system damage and other ailments. Regardless of the veracity of or the data supporting these claims, these and other claims may influence public perception of the use of vaccine product candidates and could result in greater governmental regulation, stricter labeling requirements and potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential vaccine product candidate. Such greater government regulation could have a material effect on our ability to develop and market our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate.\nWe have not conducted substantial research on the Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate and we lack experience in the research, development, manufacture, regulatory approval, marketing, commercialization and implementation of a vaccine product candidate. Also, uncertainties exist surrounding the longevity and severity of COVID-19 as a global health concern. The success of our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates could fail for a number of reasons. Accordingly, we may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully targets SARS-CoV-2 in a timely and economical manner, if at all.\nFor example, we expect to commit significant financial resources and personnel to the development of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other product candidate development program. The outcome of any research and development program is highly uncertain. Only a small fraction of biotechnology and vaccine development programs ultimately result in commercial products or even product candidates and a number of events could delay our development efforts and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to manufacture, market and sell, a vaccine. Additionally, our ability to develop an effective vaccine will depend on our ability to work on an accelerated timeline, with limited access to financial resources beyond those that we currently possess, and in competition with a significant number of better-funded and more experienced vaccine-development companies. Moreover, if the COVID-19 pandemic is effectively contained or the risk of further spread is diminished or eliminated before we can successfully develop, manufacture and commercialize Terra CoV-2, we may be unable to identify strategic partners willing to work with and support us in our development efforts and, even if we obtain regulatory approval, the market that we anticipate for this product candidate may not exist or may be much smaller than we previously anticipated. Alternatively, even if a market exists, our vaccine product candidate could be found to be ineffective or unsafe, or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances. Our vaccine product candidate, even if safe and effective, could be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or uneconomical to market, or our competitors could develop superior products more quickly and efficiently or more effectively market their competing products. Accordingly, our inability to develop a commercially-successful vaccine product will materially harm our business. In addition, other parties are currently producing and administering vaccines for the treatment for SARS-CoV-2 under the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization and other competitive vaccines are expected to seek such authorization as well. Such competitive vaccines already in the market may also lead to the diversion of governmental and nongovernmental resources away from us and toward our competitors.\nThe market opportunities for our vaccine product candidate may be smaller than we believe them to be. Moreover, any pandemic threat may abate, or alternative vaccines currently being broadly disseminated under the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization could become widely accepted and adopted before our vaccines achieve regulatory approval.\nThe primary area of focus for our future research and product development activities is the development of a vaccine candidate to prevent SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it principally causes, COVID-19. Our current projections of both the number of people who are or will be affected this disease, as well as the subset of people who may be affected by this disease and who have the potential to benefit from immunity through our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, are based on estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, because coronaviruses have evolved in recent decades and research on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 are continuously changing due to the complicated nature of the virus, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of COVID-19. The number of clinical trial participants in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, potential clinical trial participants may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products, or new clinical trial participants may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our ability to conduct the research and development necessary to complete the vaccine product candidate.\nMoreover, the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak may subside before we are able to complete research and development for our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, obtain regulatory approval for the vaccine product candidate and realize any return on our investment in the research and development. Other organizations some of which are currently broadly administering vaccines under the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization authority, may obtain broad acceptance, or government health organizations may acquire adequate stockpiles of pandemic vaccines or adopt other technologies or strategies to prevent or limit outbreaks before our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate reaches the marketplace, if at all. We may not achieve a return on our investment before the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides or competing products are widely adopted.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop our product candidates, our operating results and competitive position could be harmed. Research and development involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be successful in our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates. The further development and ultimate commercialization of product candidates for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, as well as our other product candidates, are keys to our growth strategy.\nA key element of our business strategy is to discover, develop, validate and commercialize (i) a vaccine product candidate to provide specific lifetime immunity from SARS-CoV-2, which we aim to market globally to both public and private payers (ii) the development of a portfolio of additional antibiotic product candidates to combat multi drug resistant organism, or MDRO, outbreaks and the associated costs to patients, inpatient facilities and the health care industry. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete development of, or commercialize any or all of our planned future product candidates, or that they will be clinically usable. For example, we previously attempted to develop an oral mucositis product candidate (or AG013 product candidate) and conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial that was not successful and we ceased further development and terminated our license with a third party to develop such technology. The product development process involves a high degree of risk and may take up to several years or more. Our new product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf our recent entry into the vaccine research and development industry;\n\u25cf failure of future tests at the research or development stages;\n\u25cf lack of clinical validation data to support effectiveness;\n\u25cf delays resulting from the failure of third-party suppliers or contractors to meet their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u25cf regulatory delays at the FDA or from other independent oversight authorities, particularly in light of the demands placed on public health resources during and following the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf failure to obtain or maintain necessary certifications, licenses, clearances or approvals to market or perform the test; or\n\u25cf lack of commercial acceptance by the health care marketplace.\nFew research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical trials often is not replicated in later trials. At any point, we may abandon development of products (as we did with our oral mucositis product candidate) in favor of the development or acquisition of new products (as we did with our vaccine product candidate), or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical studies or trials, which would adversely impact the timing for generating potential revenues from those new products. In addition, as we advance the development of new products through to the commercialization stage, we will have to make additional investments in our sales and marketing operations, which may be prematurely or unnecessarily incurred if the commercial launch of a product is abandoned or delayed.\nIf we are successful in producing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, we may need to devote significant resources to its scale-up and development, including for use by the U.S. government or other foreign authorities. Moreover, government involvement may limit the commercial success of our vaccine product candidate.\nBecause the COVID-19 outbreak has been classified as a pandemic by public health authorities, it is possible that one or more government entities may take actions that directly or indirectly have the effect of abrogating some of our rights or opportunities with respect to the research, development and commercialization of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate. We have not manufactured a pandemic vaccine to date, but if we were to do so, the economic value of such a vaccine to us could be limited by such government action or inaction. Various government entities, including the U.S. government, are offering, but may not continue to offer, incentives, grants and contracts to encourage additional investment by commercial organizations into preventative and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 and/or COVID-19, which may have the effect of increasing the number of competitors and/or providing advantages to known competitors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish a competitive market share for our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate.\nIn the event that any of the preclinical research or, if an IND is accepted by the FDA, the Phase 1 clinical trials for our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate are perceived to be successful, we may need to work toward the large-scale technical development, manufacturing scale-up and larger scale deployment of this potential vaccine through a variety of U.S. government-sponsored mechanisms, such as an Expanded Access Program or an Emergency Use Authorization program. In this case we may need to divert significant resources to this program, which would require diversion of resources from our other existing product candidate programs. In addition, since the path to licensure of any vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear, we may have a widely-used vaccine in circulation in the United States or another country prior to our receipt of marketing approval. Unexpected safety issues in these circumstances could lead to significant reputational damage for us and our technology platform going forward and other issues, including delays in our other programs, the need for re-design of our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources.\nOur product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to compete effectively may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on developing proprietary therapeutics. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, patenting, manufacturing and marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that we are developing. We face competition from a number of sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, including generic drug companies, biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities, sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, research and development capabilities, clinical trial expertise, intellectual property portfolios, experience in obtaining patents and regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than us. Some of the companies that offer competing products also have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer relationships with our target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. In addition, certain of our product candidates, if approved, may compete with other products, for a share of some patients\u2019 discretionary budgets and for physicians\u2019 attention within their clinical practices.\nWe anticipate that, if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will face significant competition from other approved therapies and may need to compete with unregulated, unapproved and off-label treatments. Certain of our product candidates, if approved, will present novel therapeutic approaches for the approved indications and will have to compete with existing therapies, some of which are widely known and accepted by physicians and patients. To compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the relative cost, safety and efficacy of our approved products, if any, provide an attractive alternative to existing and other new therapies. Such competition could lead to reduced market share for our product candidates and contribute to downward pressure on the pricing of our product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nDue to less stringent regulatory requirements in certain foreign countries, there are many more products and procedures available for use in those international markets than are approved for use in the United States. In certain international markets, there are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we expect to face more competition in these markets than in the United States.\nBecause our vaccine product development efforts depend on new and rapidly evolving technologies, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be successful.\nCurrently, neither the FDA has given Emergency Use Authorization authority to Moderna and Pfizer for their vaccines. A number of other vaccine manufacturers, academic institutions and other organizations currently have programs to develop such a vaccine. While we are not aware of all of our competitors\u2019 efforts, we believe that Sanofi, Janssen, Inovio, Novavax, AIM ImmunoTech Inc. and several others are in the early stages of developing vaccine candidates. These companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support their research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, manufacturing such products on a broad scale and marketing approved products. These companies may also partner or collaborate with large and established companies, such as Merck & Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, CSL Ltd, Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca, among others, or they may partner or collaborate with or obtain funding from governments, academic institutions or other nongovernmental organizations. In order to effectively compete, we will have to make substantial investments in development, testing, manufacturing and sales and marketing or partner with one or more established companies and establish differentiation from existing vaccines in the market place.\nMoreover, our new vaccine development efforts depend on new, rapidly evolving technologies. Our development efforts and, if those are successful, commercialization of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate could fail for a variety of reasons, and include the possibility that:\n\u25cf Our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate or technologies, any or all of the products based on such technologies or any manufacturing process will be ineffective or unsafe, or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals or achieve commercial viability;\n\u25cf third-party supplier or manufacturer facilities will be unable or unwilling to provide necessary supplies, including adjuvants, or scale-up manufacturing capabilities for our products in a cost-effective manner or at all;\n\u25cf the products, if safe and effective, may be difficult to manufacture on a large-scale or uneconomical to market;\n\u25cf third-party manufacturing facilities will fail to continue to pass regulatory inspections;\n\u25cf proprietary rights of third-parties will prevent us or our collaborators from exploiting technologies, and manufacturing or marketing products; and\n\u25cf Third-party competitors with Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA and use of vaccines will gain greater market share and limit or impair our development efforts.\nOur SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d), includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (\u201cBPCIA\u201d), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first approved by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until twelve years from the date on which the reference product was first approved. During this twelve-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor\u2019s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the other company\u2019s product. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty.\nWe believe that, to the extent we are able to reach the BLA stage, our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate should qualify for the twelve-year period of exclusivity. However, risks exist that we may not so qualify, that this exclusivity could be shortened due to Congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our vaccine product candidate to be a reference product for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for a reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nWe may be unable to refine a method to produce MU1140 homologs in large-scale commercial quantities. If we cannot, we will be unable to generate significant revenues from sales of our MU1140 homologs product candidate.\nOur antibiotic product candidates, all homologs of MU1140, are produced by our strain of S. mutans and variants thereof. In March 2005 we successfully developed a methodology for producing MU1140 in quantities sufficient to undertake its nonclinical testing. In June of 2012 we entered into an exclusive collaboration agreement with Precigen Corporation to use its advanced transgene and cell engineering platforms to achieve sufficient production quantities of MU1140. In 2016 we were able to transition manufacturing of OG716 to a third-party manufacturer capable of fermenting quantities sufficient to conduct nonclinical studies. If we are not able to further adequately scale up fermentation and purification methodologies for large-scale manufacture, we will be unable to partner and generate revenues from this product candidate and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. The manufacturing of MU1140 homologs, including OG716 or any other possible antibiotic product candidates based on lantibiotics, is a highly exacting and complex process. Manufacturing MU1140 homologs, including OG716, or any other antibiotic candidates derived from lantibiotics on a commercial scale has not yet been achieved to our knowledge, so there are additional risks that such efforts will not be successful. The Precigen technology may not be feasible to efficiently develop methodologies to enable large scale manufacturing of a MU1140 homolog or other antibiotic product candidates. Third-party manufacturers must have additional technical skills and must take multiple steps to attempt to control the manufacturing processes. If we are unable to produce MU1140 homologs in large-scale commercial quantities, we will be unable to generate significant revenues from sales of our MU1140 product candidate and our financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nOur success will depend on our ability to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidate under our Lantibiotics Program and its successful commercialization.\nOur product candidate under our Lantibiotics Program has not received regulatory approval in any jurisdiction and it may never receive approval or, if approvals are obtained, may never be commercialized successfully. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs relating to the nonclinical and clinical development of our antibiotic product candidates (including MU1140 homologs we may develop). We have performed extensive nonclinical testing using native MU1140 and entered into an Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement with Precigen (which was assigned to ILH Holdings, Inc. and is n/k/a Eleszto Genetika, Inc.). We began nonclinical activities on homologs of MU1140 in the second half of 2014. Those activities include toxicity results, physicochemical characterizations, and efficacy studies in animals. This work will be done solely by us through the use of outside contractors. If our nonclinical work is successful, we would expect the IND for a first-in-human clinical trial of OG716 to be filed with the FDA based on our ability to complete the requisite studies, contingent on sufficient funding.\nEven if we are able to conduct successful clinical trials or the required regulatory approvals are obtained, we may never be able to generate significant revenues from our product candidates. If our product candidates are unsuccessful, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nWe may choose not to continue developing or commercializing any of our product candidates at any time during development or after approval, which would reduce or eliminate our potential return on investment for those product candidates.\nAt any time, we may decide to discontinue the development or commercialization of any of our products or product candidates for a variety of reasons, including inadequate financial resources the appearance of new technologies that render our product obsolete, competition from competing products, inability or limitations to moving forward with development, the economic viability of moving forward with development due to competition, or changes in or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. If we terminate a program in which we have invested significant resources, we will not receive any return on our investment and we will have missed the opportunity to allocate those resources to potentially more productive uses.\nWe have limited experience in the conduct of clinical trials. We have never initiated a vaccine-related clinical trial. We have never obtained approval of any product candidates. We may be unable to undertake any of those actions successfully.\nAs a company, we have limited experience and capacity for the conduct of preclinical research and clinical trials, as well as the progression of a product candidate through to regulatory approval. Because we are in the early stages of development for Terra CoV-2 and because the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine landscape continues to evolve, our clinical trials may require more time and incur greater costs than we anticipate. We cannot be certain that planned clinical trials will begin or conclude on time, if at all. Large-scale trials would require significant additional financial and management resources, and reliance on third-party clinical investigators, CROs and/or consultants. Any performance failure on the part of such third parties could delay clinical development or delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or commercializing our current or future product candidates, depriving us of potential product revenue and resulting in additional losses. By contrast, larger pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies often have substantial staff or departments with extensive experience in conducting clinical trials with multiple product candidates across multiple indications and obtaining regulatory approval in various countries. In addition, these companies may have greater financial resources to compete for the same clinical investigators, sites and patients that we may attempt to recruit or retain for our preclinical research and clinical trials. As a result, we may be at a competitive disadvantage that could delay the initiation, recruitment, timing and completion of our preclinical research and clinical trials and obtaining regulatory, marketing and related approvals, if achieved at all, for our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate.\nWe cannot assure you that the market and consumers will accept our products or product candidates. If they do not, we will be unable to generate significant revenues from our products or product candidates and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nThe commercial success of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, our MU1140 homologs antibiotic product candidates, and any of our other product candidates and technologies, will depend in part on market acceptance by consumers. Biopharmaceutical companies have received substantial support from the scientific community, regulatory agencies and many governmental officials in the United States and internationally. Future scientific developments, media coverage and political events may diminish such support. Public attitudes may be influenced by claims that health products are unsafe for consumption or pose unknown risks to the environment or to traditional social or economic practices. Securing governmental approvals for, and consumer confidence in, such products poses numerous challenges, particularly outside the United States. The market success of product candidates developed by biopharmaceutical companies could be delayed or impaired in certain geographical areas as a result. Products based on our product candidates may compete with a number of traditional dental therapies and drugs manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. Market acceptance of products based on our product candidates will depend on a number of factors including potential advantage over alternative treatment methods. We can offer you no assurance that physicians, patients or the medical communities in general will accept and utilize products developed from our product candidates. If they do not, we may be unable to generate significant revenues from our product candidates and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we or our third-party collaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nWe will need to further increase the size and complexity of our organization in the future, and we may experience difficulties in executing our growth strategy and managing our growth.\nOur current management, personnel, systems and facilities are not adequate to support our future growth plans. We will need to further expand our scientific, sales and marketing, operational, financial and other resources to support our planned research, development, clinical trial work, and commercialization activities.\nTo manage our operations, growth and various projects effectively, we must:\n\u25cf continue to improve our operational, financial, management and regulatory compliance controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u25cf attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees;\n\u25cf develop a marketing, sales, and distribution capability;\n\u25cf manage our commercialization activities for our product candidates effectively;\n\u25cf establish and maintain relationships with development and commercialization partners;\n\u25cf manage our preclinical and clinical trials effectively;\n\u25cf manage our third-party supply and manufacturing operations effectively and in a cost-effective manner, while increasing production capabilities for our current product candidates to commercial levels; and\n\u25cf manage our development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to partners and other third parties.\nIn addition, we have utilized and continue to utilize the services of part-time outside consultants to perform a number of tasks for us, including tasks related to preclinical and clinical testing. Our growth strategy may also entail expanding our use of consultants to implement these and other tasks going forward. We rely on consultants for certain functions of our business and will need to effectively manage these consultants to ensure that they successfully carry out their contractual obligations and meet expected deadlines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside consultants, as needed, on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to manage our growth effectively and expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our use of consultants, we might be unable to implement successfully the tasks necessary to execute effectively on our planned research, development and commercialization activities and, accordingly, might fail to achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nIf our manufacturers and suppliers in general fail to meet our requirements and the requirements of regulatory authorities, our research and development may be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not have the internal capability to manufacture our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, MU1140 homologs, or any other product candidates and all of their constituent parts under GMPs, as required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. In order to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates and to apply for regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we will need to contract with third parties that have, or otherwise develop, the necessary manufacturing capabilities in full compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under GMPs that are capable of manufacturing our product candidates. Due to the early-stage development of our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, we cannot at this time accurately predict the numbers and capabilities of manufacturers that will be required and capable of manufacturing the vaccine product candidate and any of its components. Manufacturing on a commercial scale has not yet been undertaken and there are additional technical skills needed for the manufacture of MU1140 homologs that will further limit the number of potential manufacturers. As such, if we are unable to enter into supply and processing contracts with any of these manufacturers or processors for our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, our MU1140 product candidates, or our other product candidates for the conduct of clinical trials on such product candidate we may incur additional costs and delays in development and commercialization.\nProblems with these manufacturing processes such as equipment malfunctions, facility contamination, labor problems, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist activities, or disruptions in the operations of our suppliers and even minor deviations from normal procedures, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims and insufficient inventory or supply of product for the conduct of clinical trials. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and government shutdowns in response have interrupted supply chains, the manufacture and transmission of goods and the regularity with which manufacturers ordinarily operate. Such interruptions, unless remedied entirely, can disrupt our research and development efforts and our clinical trials, and even if remedied, could create delays that materially impact our business.\nIf we are required to find an additional or alternative source of supply, for example with respect to our ability to obtain an adjuvant, there may be additional costs and delays in the development, clinical trial timing, or commercialization of our product candidates. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory agencies routinely inspect manufacturing facilities before approving a New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologic License Application, or BLA, for a drug or biologic manufactured at those sites. If any of our manufacturers or processors fails to satisfy regulatory requirements, the approval and eventual commercialization of our commercial products and product candidates may be delayed.\nAll of our contract manufacturers must comply with the applicable GMPs, which include quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. If our contract manufacturers do not comply with the applicable GMPs and other FDA regulatory requirements, we may be subject to product liability claims, the availability of marketed products for sale could be reduced, our product commercialization could be delayed or subject to restrictions, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and may lose potential revenues and we could suffer delays in the progress of nonclinical testing and clinical trials for products under development. We do not have control over our third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Moreover, while we may choose to manufacture our products ourselves in the future, we have no experience in the manufacture of pharmaceutical or biological products for clinical trials or commercial purposes. If we decide to manufacture products, we would be subject to the regulatory requirements described above. In addition, we would require substantial additional capital and would be subject to delays or difficulties encountered in manufacturing pharmaceutical or biological products. Regardless of the manufacturer of our products, we will be subject to continuing obligations regarding the submission of safety reports and other post-market information.\nWe rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of our senior management and scientific team and the loss of any of our key personnel or our inability to successfully hire their successors could harm our business.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and scientific team, who have extensive experience and specialized expertise in our business. Our performance also depends on our ability to retain and motivate our other key employees. In June 2016, we hired Dr. Alan Joslyn as President and Chief Executive Officer and in February 2012 we hired Mr. Michael Sullivan, Certified Public Accountant as our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Sullivan also served as our Interim Principal Executive Officer from October of 2014 through June of 2016. The loss of the services of senior management or any key employees could harm our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. We have no key man life insurance policies.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Noachis Terra, we added vaccine consultants and advisors, who were engaged in various capacities related to the research and development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate. Our ability to successfully continue the vaccine development depends in large part on our ability to retain certain consultants. Despite our efforts to retain these consultants, one or more may terminate their engagement with us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of these consultants could have substantial negative effects on our research and development efforts, which are necessary to further development of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate.\nWe need to hire and retain additional qualified scientists and other highly skilled personnel to maintain and grow our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial and research personnel in all areas within our organization. We plan to continue to grow our business and will need to hire additional personnel to support this growth. We believe that there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills to serve in many of our key positions, and we compete for key personnel with other biotechnology companies, as well as universities and research institutions. It is often difficult to hire and retain these persons, and we may be unable to replace key persons if they leave or be unable to fill new positions requiring key persons with appropriate experience. If we fail to attract, integrate and retain the necessary personnel, our ability to maintain and grow our business could suffer significantly.\nIf any of our product candidates are shown to be ineffective or harmful in humans, we will be unable to generate revenues from these product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through nonclinical testing and clinical trials that our products are safe and effective for use in humans. To date the testing of the antibiotic substance MU1140 homologs has been undertaken solely in the laboratory and in animals. We have not yet conducted human trials with any MU1140 homolog nor have we initiated clinical trials for our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate. To date, available clinical data for our AG013 product candidate has been limited to a Phase 1b clinical trial and top-line results from our Phase 2 clinical trial, the latter of which did not demonstrate statistical significance on the primary endpoint of severe oral mucositis when compared to placebo and we ceased further development of such product candidate and terminated our license with our collaboration partner concerning the development of such product candidate. It is possible that when and if future lantibiotic trials and/or our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate trials are conducted in humans, they will show that our antibiotic or vaccine candidates are ineffective or harmful in humans. If MU1140 homologs are shown to be ineffective or harmful in humans, we will be unable to commercialize and generate revenues from sales of this compound. If we are unable to generate revenues from the first generation of MU1140 and homologs, or any other product candidates, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nBecause we are new to vaccine development, we must identify vaccines for development with our technologies and establish successful third-party relationships.\nBecause we are new to vaccine development and lack substantial experience in the research and development of vaccines, the near and long-term viability of our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate will depend in part on our ability to successfully establish new strategic collaborations with biotechnology companies, non-profit organizations, governmental agencies and other vaccine industry entities. Establishing strategic collaborations and obtaining government funding is difficult and time-consuming. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or based on their internal pipeline; government agencies may reject contract or grant applications based on their assessment of public need, the public interest, our products\u2019 ability to address these areas, or other reasons beyond our expectations or control. If we fail to establish a strategic collaborations or government relationships on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate or generate sufficient revenue to fund further research and development efforts.\nAdditionally, we do not have our own clinical research and development facilities dedicated to vaccine development and manufacture. We have in the past and may in the future engage consultants and independent contract research organizations, subject to regulatory considerations, to design and conduct its clinical trials in connection with the development of our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate. As a result, these important aspects of a product\u2019s development will be outside of our direct control. Even if we establish new collaborations or obtain government funding, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of our vaccine product candidate for several reasons, including the fact that:\n\u25cf we may not have the ability to control the activities of our partners and cannot provide assurance that they will fulfill their obligations to us, including with respect to the license, development and commercialization of our vaccine product candidate, in a timely manner or at all;\n\u25cf such partners may not devote sufficient resources to our vaccine product candidate or properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf any failure on the part of our partners to perform or satisfy their obligations to us could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of our vaccine product candidate and affect our ability to realize product revenue; and\n\u25cf disagreements, including disputes over the ownership of technology developed with such collaborators, could result in litigation, which would be time consuming and expensive, and may delay or terminate research and development efforts, regulatory approvals and commercialization activities.\nOur collaborators will be subject to the same regulatory approval of their manufacturing facility and process as us. Before we could begin commercial manufacturing of any of our vaccine candidates, we and our collaborators must pass a pre-approval inspection before FDA approval and comply with the FDA\u2019s GMP regulations. If our collaborators fail to comply with these requirements, our vaccine candidate may not be approved. If our collaborators fail to comply with these requirements after approval, we could be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products. If we or our collaborators fail to establish agreements as necessary, we could be required to undertake research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities solely at our own expense. These activities would significantly increase our capital requirements and, given our lack of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, significantly delay the commercialization of our vaccine product candidate.\nWe intend to seek licensing partners to cover a portion of the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approval for, and manufacturing and marketing of, our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain agreements with third parties to fund these costs, we will have to fund such costs ourselves or we may be unable to extract any value from these technologies.\nAs we continue our development of product candidates, we intend to either license these product candidates to, or partner with, one or more major pharmaceutical companies at the earliest possible time in their product development. If we do so, we intend for these licensees or partners to pay the costs associated with any remaining development work, regulatory submissions, clinical trials and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates. If we are unable to license our product candidates or otherwise partner with third parties, we will have to fund the costs of our clinical trials ourselves or we will be unable to extract any value from these technologies. We may also have to establish our own manufacturing facilities and find our own distribution channels. This would greatly increase our future capital requirements and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the necessary financing to pay these costs. If we are unable to cover the associated costs or we cannot obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nOur dependence on collaborative arrangements with third parties subjects us to a number of risks. These collaborative arrangements may not be on terms favorable to us. Agreements with collaborative partners typically allow partners significant discretion in electing whether or not to pursue any of the planned activities. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources our collaborative partners may devote to products based on the collaboration, and our partners may choose to pursue alternative products. Our partners may not perform their obligations as expected. Business combinations or significant changes in a collaborative partner\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a partner\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under the arrangement. Moreover, we could become involved in disputes with our partners, which could lead to delays or termination of the collaborations and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. Even if we fulfill our obligations under a collaborative agreement, our partner may be able to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances. If any collaborative partner were to terminate or breach our agreement with it, or otherwise fail to complete its obligations in a timely manner, our chances of successfully commercializing our product candidates would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.\nWe expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets. Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities. We may not succeed in completing targeted transactions, including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive, or achieve desired results of operations. Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture. Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. The loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets, operations or businesses. Furthermore, acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability. We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions. We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition, investment or joint venture we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company\u2019s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties. In addition, we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target\u2019s previous activities, internal controls and security environment. If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100% of the equity. This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses. For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments. Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. We also periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may face product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. This risk exists even if a product is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our products and product candidates are designed to affect bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our product candidates could result in injury and possibly death to a patient. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could inhibit our business.\nIn addition, a liability claim may be brought against us even if our product candidates merely appear to have caused an injury. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our product candidates, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u25cf decreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u25cf impairment of our brand and/or reputation;\n\u25cf product recall or withdrawal from the market or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf substantial costs of any related litigation or similar disputes;\n\u25cf distraction of management\u2019s attention and other resources from our primary business;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants against us that may not be covered by insurance; or\n\u25cf loss of revenue.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance coverage for clinical trials, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our product liability-related expenses or losses and may not cover us for any expenses or losses we suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, in sufficient amounts or upon adequate terms to protect us against losses due to product liability, particularly if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval. Further, a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Tampa, Florida, a hurricane zone. If a disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as enterprise financial systems, manufacturing resource planning or enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. Our contract manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 facilities are located in multiple locations, where other natural disasters or similar events, such as blizzards, tornadoes, fires, explosions or large-scale accidents or power outages, and other public health emergencies could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. For example, the recent COVID-19 pandemic may cause significant disruption to our business operations, the operations of our third-party contractors and suppliers and the operations of our clinical trials, including as a result of significant restrictions or bans on travel into and within the geographic areas in which our manufacturers product our product candidates or where we conduct our clinical trials. A public health emergency could also affect the operations of the FDA and other regulatory or public health authorities, resulting in delays to meetings related to planned or completed clinical trials and ultimately of reviews and approvals of our product candidates. Such disruption could impede, delay, limit or prevent our employees and third-party contractors from beginning or continuing research and development or clinical trial-related activities, which may impede, delay, limit or prevent initiation or completion of our ongoing clinical trials and preclinical research and ultimately lead to the delay or denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could seriously harm our operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, acts of terrorism and other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our partners, manufacturers or the economy as a whole. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if we do not implement a disaster recovery plan or our partners\u2019 or manufacturers\u2019 disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in delays in the regulatory approval, manufacture, distribution or commercialization of our product candidates, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects would suffer.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited, each of which could harm our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $142,893,000. We also accumulated U.S. federal and state research tax credits of approximately $4,043,000 as of December 31, 2020 Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-ownership change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of the Corporation\u2019s ownership (by value) of one or more \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. In the event that it is determined that we have in the past experienced an ownership change as a result of transactions in our stock, or if we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then we may be limited in our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn. Any limitations on the ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could harm our business.\nOur auditor has previously expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and absent additional financing we may be unable to remain a going concern.\nIn light of our recurring losses, accumulated deficit and negative cash flow as described in our notes to our audited financial statements, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 contained an explanatory paragraph raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements did not include any adjustments that may have been necessary in the event we were unable to continue as a going concern. Had we been unable to establish to the satisfaction of our independent registered public accounting firm that the net proceeds from our financing efforts will be sufficient to allow for the removal of this going concern qualification, we may need to significantly modify our operational plans for us to continue as a going concern. We believe we can continue our current level of operations with the cash we have on hand inclusive of the proceeds from our ATM facility and warrant exercises, and net of the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock of approximately $5.6 million, without additional financing through the second quarter of 2022. Absent sufficient additional financing, we may be unable to remain a going concern.\nRisks Related to Our Licenses, Intellectual Property and Data Security and Privacy\nOur vaccine research and development efforts are to a large extent dependent upon our intellectual property and biologicals materials license with the NIAID and the NIH.\nAn important element of our intellectual property portfolio is our license with the NIAID and the NIH. Pursuant to the Patent License and Biological Materials License Agreement, we hold a nonexclusive, worldwide license to certain specified patent rights (including patent applications, provisional patent applications and Patent Cooperation Treaty (\u201cPCT\u201d) patent applications) and biological materials relating to the use of prefusion coronavirus spike proteins for the purpose of developing and commercializing a vaccine product candidate for SARS-CoV-2. This intellectual property and biological materials license is essential to our operations and our ability to research and develop our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate. The terms of the license agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (a) twenty (20) years from the first commercial sale where no licensed patent rights exist or have ceased to exist or (b) the expiration of the last to expire of any licensed patent rights. Additionally, we must use reasonable commercial efforts to develop, manufacture, and commercialize our vaccine product candidate, to manufacture our vaccine product candidate substantially within the United States and provide the United States public with reasonable access to our vaccine, if approved for commercialization by the FDA. If we breach the terms of the license agreement, including any failure to make minimum royalty payments required thereunder or failure to reach certain developmental milestones, using best efforts to introduce a licensed product or practice a licensed process in certain territories by certain dates, the NIAID has the right to terminate the license.\nIf we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain the NIH license on acceptable terms, or find that it is necessary or appropriate to secure new licenses from other third parties, it would halt our ability to develop and market our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Thus, our inability to retain the rights and technologies identified by the license, or those that we may in the future identify, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to complete the development of our vaccine product candidate. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in licensing any additional rights or technologies from the NIAID, the NIH or others. If we fail to retain the NIH license or if we fail to obtain additional rights and licenses necessary to further the development and commercialization of our vaccine product candidate, our planned development for our vaccine product candidate may be materially impacted and the costs associated with the development may increase significantly, and we may be entirely unable to complete development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate.\nWe may incur additional expenses and obligations in connection our NIH license.\nWe must use reasonable commercial efforts to bring to market a vaccine product candidate covered by the license, which means we must adhere to an existing commercial development plan and existing performance benchmarks. Additionally, we are obliged to pay to the NIAID certain minimum annual royalties, certain benchmark-related royalties and royalties based upon a share of any net sales of our vaccine product candidate, following regulatory approval and the first commercial sale. Additionally, among other obligations, we must provide regular written reports to the NIAID on the development status of our vaccine product candidate and pay for our pro rata share of the NIH\u2019s patent prosecution-related expenses and fees. Moreover, we must use reasonable commercial efforts to develop, manufacture, and commercialize the vaccine product candidate, to manufacture the vaccine product candidate substantially within the United States and provide the United States public with reasonable access to the vaccine, if approved for commercialization by the FDA. All of these additional obligations beyond ordinary research and development and regulatory compliance related to the approval of our vaccine product candidate may impose delays or greater costs upon our ability to timely develop our vaccine product candidate.\nAlthough our forecasts for expenses and the sufficiency of our capital resources will take into account the funds available for the research and development of our vaccine product candidate development, our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include, but are not limited to, changes in the focus and direction of our development programs, competitive and technical advances, costs associated with the development of our product candidates and the our share of the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing the intellectual property rights covered by the NIH license. If we exhaust the funds available for the development of Terra CoV-2 more quickly than anticipated, regardless of the reason, and we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may be unable to meet our obligations under the NIH license, which may be terminated, and we will be unable to proceed with development of our product candidates on expected timelines and will be forced to prioritize among them.\nThe intellectual property covered by our NIH license concerns patent applications and provisional applications. We cannot assure investors that any of the currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents, nor can we predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted.\nThe intellectual property covered by our NIH license concerns certain, specified patent rights (including patent applications, provisional patent applications and PCT patent applications). Although the NIAID has agreed to assume responsibility for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patent applications covered by the licensed patent rights, we cannot be certain as to when or if final patents will be issued for those patent applications covered by the licensed patent rights. However, the NIH may not successfully prosecute certain patent applications, the prosecution of which they control, under which we are only a licensee and on which our business substantially depends. Even if patents issue from these applications, the NIH may fail to maintain these patents, may decide not to pursue litigation against third-party infringers, may fail to prove infringement or may fail to defend against counterclaims of patent invalidity or unenforceability.\nMoreover, it is possible that the licensed pending patent applications will not result in granted patents, and even if such pending patent applications grant as patents, they may not provide a basis for intellectual property protection of commercially viable vaccine products or may not provide us with any competitive advantages. Further, it is possible that, for any of the patents that may be granted in the future, others will design around the licensed patent rights or identify methods for preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 that do not concern the rights covered by our NIH license. Further, we cannot assure investors that other parties will not challenge any patents granted to the NIH or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold NIH\u2019s patents to be valid or enforceable. We cannot guarantee investors that, if required to defend the covered patents, we will be successful in defending challenges made against the NIH patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge to the NIH patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents, or to such patents being interpreted narrowly or otherwise in a manner adverse to our interests. Our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties.\nRisks with respect to the NIH and our NIH license may also arise out of circumstances beyond our control. In spite of our best efforts, the NIH may conclude that we have materially breached the license agreement and may therefore terminate the agreement, thereby removing our ability to market vaccine product candidates covered by the agreement. If the NIH license agreement is terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended market protection, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products similar or identical to ours. Moreover, if the NIH license agreement is terminated, the NIH may be able to prevent us from utilizing the technology covered by the licensed patent rights. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive business position and our financial condition, results of operations and our business prospects.\nWe cannot prevent the NIH or other companies, including our competitors, from licensing the same intellectual property and biological materials that we have licensed or from otherwise duplicating our business model and operations.\nOur NIH license is a nonexclusive license and we are not permitted to sublicense the intellectual property or biological materials covered by the license. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the NIH has not previously licensed, or that the NIH will not, in the future, license the intellectual property or biological materials to other biotechnology companies, including those who intend to develop a vaccine product candidate for SARS-CoV-2, some or all of the nonexclusive intellectual property and biological materials available to us under the NIH license. Moreover, we do not currently own any exclusive rights or licenses necessary to fully develop our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, and such rights or licenses, if in existence, could be held by our competitors or used by other third parties to otherwise directly compete against us. If our competitors or others have or acquire exclusive rights or licenses that they could enforce against us, then we may be required to alter our products, pay licensing fees or cease activities. If our products conflict with rights or licenses of others, third parties could bring legal actions against us or our collaborators, licensees, suppliers or customers, claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products. If these legal actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products. We may not prevail in any legal action and a required license under the patent may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, while we may develop, acquire or license the additional technologies necessary to the development of our vaccine candidate we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop, acquire or license such technologies or that alternatives will be sufficient to enable development of our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate or to prevent others from competing with us and developing substantially-similar products.\nOur Lantibiotic Development program development efforts are to a large extent dependent upon our intellectual property and exclusive channel collaboration agreement with Eleszto Genetika, Inc. (\u201cEGI\u201d) is based on early-stage technology in its field.\nOur exclusive channel collaboration agreement contemplates the use of EGI\u2019s advanced transgene and cell engineering platforms for the development and production of lantibiotics. Such technologies have a limited history of use in the design and development of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug products involving direct administration and may therefore involve unanticipated risks or delays.\nWe will incur additional expenses in connection with our exclusive channel collaboration arrangement.\nPursuant to our exclusive channel collaboration, we are responsible for future research and development expenses of product candidates developed under such collaboration, including those incurred by our collaboration partners for research on our behalf as provided in the lantibiotic exclusive channel collaboration Agreement (\u201cLantibiotic ECC\u201d). As a result, we expect the level of our overall research and development expenses going forward will increase. The timing and amount of expenses under our Lantibiotic ECC are difficult to predict. Although all manufacturing, nonclinical studies and human clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, costs associated with the manufacturing, research and development of biologic product candidates are generally greater in comparison to small molecule product candidates. We expect over time to add additional personnel to support our Lantibiotics Program as we progress in our development efforts.\nBecause our collaborations pursuant to our Lantibiotic ECC is in the early stage, future development costs associated with this program may be difficult to anticipate and exceed our expectations. Our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include, but are not limited to, unanticipated technical challenges, changes in the focus and direction of our development activities or adjustments necessitated by changes in the competitive landscape in which we operate. If we are unable to continue to financially support such collaborations due to our own working capital constraints, we may be forced to delay our activities. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may be forced to seek licensing partners or discontinue development, which in turn could lead to the termination of our Lantibiotic ECC.\nWe may not be able to retain the exclusive rights licensed to us under our Lantibiotic ECC to develop and commercialize lantibiotic products.\nUnder our Lantibiotic ECC we are responsible for, among other things, funding the further anticipated development of lantibiotics toward the goal of commercialization, conducting nonclinical and clinical development of product candidates, as well as for other aspects of manufacturing and the commercialization of the product(s). Our collaboration partners may terminate such agreement if we do not perform certain specified requirements, including developing therapies identified to us and considered superior by our collaboration partners. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully perform under the Lantibiotic ECC and if the Lantibiotic ECC is terminated it would prevent us from achieving our business objectives.\nOur Collaboration Partner, EGI, may not devote sufficient time and resources to successfully carry out their contracted duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to advance our product candidates in a timely manner or at all.\nOn January 31, 2020, our prior collaboration partner, Intrexon Corporation, pursuant to a restructuring which in part, resulted in a change of Intrexon\u2019s name to Precigen, Inc. In addition, pursuant to Precigen\u2019s restructuring plan, the Lantibiotic ECC and Lantibiotic Stock Issuance Agreement were assigned to and assumed by ILH Holdings, Inc. (\u201cILH\u201d) (n/k/a Eleszto Genetika, Inc. (\u201cEGI\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Precigen, Precigen subsequently sold the majority of its bioengineering assets, inclusive of EGI, to TS Biotechnology, an entity managed by Third Security. Our success depends, in part, on the performance by our collaborators of their responsibilities under our collaboration arrangements. Our new collaborator may not perform their obligations in a timely fashion or in a manner satisfactory to us or consistent with how previously performed. Typically, we cannot control the amount of resources or time our collaborators may devote to our programs or potential products that may be developed in collaboration with us. We are currently involved in multiple research and development collaborations with academic and research institutions. These collaborators frequently depend on outside sources of funding to conduct or complete research and development, such as grants or other awards. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to control the precise timing and execution of any experiments that may be conducted.\nAdditionally, our current or future corporate collaborators will retain the ability to pursue other research, product development or commercial opportunities that may be directly competitive with our programs. If these collaborators elect to prioritize or pursue other programs in lieu of ours, we may not be able to advance product development programs in an efficient or effective manner, if at all. If a collaborator is pursuing a competitive program and encounters unexpected financial or capability limitations, they may be motivated to reduce the priority placed on our programs or delay certain activities related to our programs or be unwilling to properly fund their share of the development expenses for our programs. Any of these developments could harm our product and technology development efforts, which could seriously harm our business.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe or the NIH may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in the licensed patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or the NIH may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing the intellectual property covered by the NIH license or our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or our license or the NIH\u2019s ownership, as applicable, of the licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as our right to use intellectual property that is important to our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in patent law or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nThe United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Further, recent United States Supreme Court rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Moreover, patent law and protection in foreign countries, particularly developing countries, may be insufficient or otherwise unclear in its efficacy to protect our intellectual property. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the scope and value of patents, once obtained.\nFor our U.S. patent applications containing a priority claim after March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, also known as the America Invents Act, or AIA, was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA. It is not clear what other, if any, impact(s) the AIA will have on the operation of our business. Moreover, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business. One important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party who files a patent application with the USPTO after such date but prior to us may therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we were the first to invent. This \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d system will require us both to remain cognizant, going forward, of the timing between invention and filing of a patent application.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are those that (i) limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and (ii) provide opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. Such changes apply to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued prior to March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings, as compared to the evidentiary standard applied in U.S. federal courts, necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially present evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to find a claim invalid, notwithstanding that the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate a claim first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt opportunistically to use USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims.\nDepending on decisions by the United States Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors\u2019 abilities to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future.\nIf we are unable to protect our trademarks or other intellectual property from infringement, our business prospects may be harmed.\nWe have applied for trademark protection for trademarks in the United States, the European Union and China. Although we take steps to monitor the possible infringement or misuse of our trademarks, it is possible that third parties may infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights. Any unauthorized use of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights could harm our reputation or commercial interests. Moreover, our license with the NIH and NIAID, the NIAID does not commit to defend any declaratory judgment action alleging the invalidity of any of the licensed patent rights covered by the license, nor does the NIAID commit to commence legal actions against third parties alleged to infringe upon those licensed patent rights. Our enforcement against third-party infringers or violators may be unduly expensive and time-consuming, and any remedy obtained may constitute insufficient redress relative to the damages we may suffer.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection insufficient to guard against such infringement. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nThe legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals. In such instances, we may be unable to enjoin or otherwise prevent infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights, generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could (i) result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, (ii) put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and (iii) provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. In addition, certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may be unable to seek adequate remedies to address infringement and/or material diminishment of the value of our patents, which could limit our potential revenue opportunities in such jurisdictions. Accordingly, our efforts to establish or enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from our intellectual property. Finally, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property license agreements, we could lose our license rights that are important to our business and development of our product candidates.\nIn addition to our intellectual property and biological materials license with the NIH, we are a party to an exclusive channel collaboration agreement that impose various royalty and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our collaboration partners may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we may not be able to develop or market the affected product candidate. Both the NIH license and the Lantibiotic ECC may be terminated in the event of a breach. The loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time-consuming and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market, and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot guarantee that marketing and selling such candidates and using such technologies will not infringe existing or future patents. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields relating to our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents issue, the risk increases that others may assert that our product candidates, technologies or methods of delivery or use infringe their patent rights. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various drugs, biologics, drug delivery systems or their methods of use, and which of these patents may be valid and enforceable. Thus, due to the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our fields, third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates, technologies or methods.\nIn addition, our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe patents owned and/or filed by third parties, or third parties may allege such infringement. Because (i) some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, (ii) patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing and (iii) publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our own and in-licensed issued patents or our pending applications. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our product candidates or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our own and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to those owned or in-licensed to us, we or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate, in the United States, in an interference proceeding to determine priority of invention.\nWe may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates or proprietary technologies infringe such third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, including litigation resulting from filing under Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Such lawsuits can be costly and could adversely affect our operating results and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel, even if we do not infringe such patents or the patents asserted against us are later invalidated. A court may, however, decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and order us to cease the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay to such third-party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property, or such rights might be restrictive and limit our present and future activities. Ultimately, we or a licensee could be prevented from commercializing a product, or forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms.\nIn addition to possible infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference, derivation, re-examination or other post-grant proceedings declared or granted by the USPTO, and similar proceedings in foreign countries, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current or future products.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, generally. To date, no litigation asserting infringement claims has ever been brought against us. If a third-party claim that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including:\n\u25cf infringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product or technology at issue infringes or violates the third party\u2019s rights, and if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees;\n\u25cf a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing the product or using the technology unless the third party licenses its intellectual property rights to us, which it is not required to do;\n\u25cf if a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or upfront fees or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products or technologies; and\n\u25cf redesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could harm our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nBecause we rely on certain third-party licensors and partners, and will continue to do so in the future, if one of our licensors or partners is sued for infringing a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could suffer in the same manner as if we were sued directly. In addition to facing litigation risks, we have agreed to indemnify certain third-party licensors and partners against claims of infringement caused by our proprietary technologies, and we have entered or may enter into cost-sharing agreements with some our licensors and partners that could require us to pay some of the costs of patent litigation brought against those third parties whether or not the alleged infringement is caused by our proprietary technologies. In certain instances, these cost-sharing agreements could also require us to assume greater responsibility for infringement damages than our technology alone would otherwise suggest.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property, including our patent applications or the patents of our licensors. As a result, we may be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use. Such proceedings and/or litigation can be expensive - particularly for a company of our size - and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to enjoin the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover its technology or that the factors necessary to grant an injunction are not satisfied. An adverse determination in such case could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, interpreted narrowly or amended such that they fail to cover or otherwise protect our product candidates. Moreover, such adverse determinations could subject our patent applications to the risk that they will not issue, or issue with limited and potentially inadequate scope to cover our product candidates.\nInterference, derivation or other proceedings brought at the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or patentability of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our licensors or potential partners. Litigation or USPTO proceedings brought by us may fail or may be invoked against us by third parties. Even if we are successful, domestic or foreign litigation, or USPTO or foreign patent office proceedings may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management. We may not be able, alone or with our licensors or potential partners, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that we may, intentionally or incidentally, disclose some of our confidential results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments or public access to related documents. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed.\nOur success will depend on our ability to partner or sub-license our product candidates and their subsequent successful commercialization.\nOur MU1140 homologs product candidate and vaccine candidate are in early-stage development and is expected to require partners with substantial financial resources to continue the development of the product to commercialization. In addition, these product candidates have not received regulatory approval in any jurisdiction and they may never receive approval or, if approvals are obtained, may never be commercialized successfully. In addition, we do not know whether any of our clinical trials will be successful or can be completed within our current expected budget. For our MU1140 homologs and other antibiotic product candidates, we have performed nonclinical testing using native MU1140 and expect to continue to pursue the nonclinical testing of our MU1140 homologs and other antibiotic product candidates during 2021 we would expect the IND for a first-in-human clinical trial of OG716 to be filed with the FDA based on our ability to complete the requisite studies, contingent on sufficient funding. Even if we are able to partner and conduct successful clinical trials or the required regulatory approvals are obtained, we may never be able to generate significant revenues from our MU1140 homologs or other antibiotic product candidates or other product candidates. If our MU1140 homologs product candidate or our other product candidates under the Lantibiotics Program or our vaccine development are unsuccessful, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nIf our intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products or product candidates, or if third parties claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights, others could compete against us more directly or we could be subject to significant litigation. Such results could prevent us from marketing our products or product candidates and hurt our profitability.\nOur product and product candidates are protected by patents and patent applications. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents or rights to patents, protect trade secrets, operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, and prevent others from infringing on our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We will be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks and licenses. Patent protection generally involves complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, enforceability of patent rights cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may not provide adequate protection against competitors. In addition, any future patent applications may fail to result in patents being issued. Also, those patents that are issued may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar product candidates. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nIn addition to patents and trademarks, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We seek protection of these rights, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for violation of our rights in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information. Failure to protect our proprietary rights could seriously impair our competitive position.\nIn the event of an infringement or violation, we may face litigation and may be prevented from pursuing product development or commercialization. We may receive in the future, notice of claims of infringement of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. We may not have the financial resources to defend against claims of infringement by other parties or to prosecute third parties for infringement of our intellectual property. Infringement or other claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future and it is possible that past or future assertions or prosecutions could harm our business.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of cybersecurity/information systems risk.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our manufacturers and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, ransomware, unauthorized access, natural disasters, fire, explosions or large-scale accidents, power outages or surges, terrorism, successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. In addition, our systems safeguard important confidential personal data regarding our subjects. If a disruption event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe may incur costs of addressing a cybersecurity incident.\nCybersecurity incidents have increased in number and severity recently and it is expected that these trends will continue. Should we be affected by such an incident, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, which may include:\n\u25cf investigation costs and costs to engage specialized consultants;\n\u25cf remediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system damage, and incentives to customers or business partners in an effort to maintain relationships after an attack; and\n\u25cf litigation and legal risks, including regulatory actions by state and federal regulators.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of failures in our internal computer systems or those of our collaborators.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future partners, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of manufacturing records or clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nOur product candidates are subject to substantial government regulation, including the regulation of nonclinical testing and clinical trials. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to generate revenues.\nThe production and marketing of products which may be developed from our Terra CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, and our MU1140 homologs, or otherwise and our research and development, nonclinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities. Most of the product candidates we are developing must undergo rigorous nonclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process before they can be marketed in the United States or internationally.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may have to cease further development. Clinical trials on our product candidates are expected to take several years to fully complete. The commencement or completion of nonclinical studies or clinical trials can be delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including:\n\u25cf limitations directly caused by, or restrictions imposed in response to, the COVID-19 pandemic, including our ability to conduct research and development and clinical trials, to engage or continue to engage with third-party contractors and suppliers or to comply with regulatory obligations relating to our business;\n\u25cf an inability to raise sufficient capital to commence, conduct, or complete clinical trials;\n\u25cf difficulties in finding a partner with the resources to support large and expensive clinical development and commercialization costs;\n\u25cf findings in nonclinical trials;\n\u25cf difficulties obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial or complying with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or term of a clinical trial;\n\u25cf delays in reaching or failing to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf insufficient or inadequate supply or quality of a product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u25cf difficulties obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u25cf challenges recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including the size and nature of patient population, proximity of patients to clinical sites, eligibility criteria for the trial, nature of the trial protocol, the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant condition and competition from other clinical trial programs for similar indications;\n\u25cf severe or unexpected drug or biologic-related side effects experienced by patients in a clinical trial; and\n\u25cf difficulties retaining patients who have enrolled in a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to rigors of the trial, lack of efficacy, side effects, or personal issues, or who are lost to further follow up.\nClinical trials also may be delayed or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. In addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the IRBs at the sites where the IRBs are overseeing a trial, or a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, overseeing the clinical trial at issue, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u25cf inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf inspection of manufacturing and drug packaging operations by regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf unforeseen safety issues or lack of effectiveness; and\n\u25cf lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nWe cannot assure you that clinical trials will demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of any of our product candidates, or will otherwise satisfy regulatory requirements. Our nonclinical studies or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, there may be inconsistencies between early clinical trial results and results obtained in later clinical trials, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials. Moreover, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in nonclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval for their products. If we are unable to resolve the FDA\u2019s concerns, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for these product candidates.\nThe pre-marketing approval process can be particularly expensive, uncertain and lengthy, and a number of products for which FDA or other governmental regulatory approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing. In addition to testing and approval procedures, extensive regulations also govern marketing, manufacturing, distribution, labeling, and record-keeping procedures. If we do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such violations could result in warning letters, non-approval, suspensions of regulatory approvals or ongoing clinical trials, civil penalties and criminal fines, product seizures and recalls, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.\nWe may encounter such delays and rejection of our product candidates by the FDA or other regulatory authority may also adversely affect our business. Such delays or rejection may be encountered due to, among other reasons, government or regulatory delays, lack of efficacy during clinical trials, unforeseen safety issues, or changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development. More stringent regulatory approval processes in product clearance and enforcement activities could result in our experiencing longer approval cycles, more uncertainty, greater risk, and higher expenses. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, this approval may entail limitations on uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted. It is possible, for example, that we may not receive FDA approval to market products based on our licensed, patented product candidates for different indications or to market updated products that represent extensions of our basic product candidates. In addition, we may not receive FDA approval to export our products based on our licensed, patented product candidates in the future, and countries to which products are to be exported may not approve them for import.\nFrom time to time, legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced that could alter the review and approval process relating to our product candidates. It is possible that the applicable regulatory authority will issue additional regulations further restricting the sale of our product candidates. Any change in legislation or regulations that govern the review and approval process relating to our future product candidates could make it more difficult and costlier to obtain approval for new products based on our product candidates, or to produce, market, and distribute such products if approved.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate, or other early-stage product candidates under applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates. The delay, limitation or denial of any regulatory approval would adversely impact commercialization, our potential to generate revenue, our business and our operating results.\nWe are not permitted to market any of our current product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA or BLA from the FDA. We are also not permitted to market any of our current product candidates in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from the applicable regulatory authorities of such countries. Failure to obtain such regulatory approvals will delay or prevent us from commercializing any of our current or future product candidates.\nTo gain approval to market a new drug such as OG716, or a new biological product such as our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate or AG013, we must provide the FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities with, among other things, extensive preclinical and clinical data that adequately demonstrates the safety and efficacy of the drug in its intended indication and information to demonstrate the adequacy of the manufacturing methods to assure the drug\u2019s identity, strength, quality and purity. The development and approval of new drug product candidates involves a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, including in Phase 3 clinical development, even after promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, observations during clinical trials regarding safety or efficacy, such as previously unreported adverse events. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure success in later clinical trials, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we may conduct. Further, different results may be achieved depending upon whether the \u201cper protocol\u201d, or PP, analysis is used to report data results or whether the \u201cmodified intent-to-treat,\u201d or MITT, approach is used. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of any Phase 2 trials, our Phase 3 trials may not be successful.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates for many reasons. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may:\n\u25cf disagree with the design or implementation of one or more clinical trials;\n\u25cf decline to deem a product candidate safe and effective for its proposed indication, or deem a product candidate\u2019s safety or other perceived risks to outweigh its clinical or other benefits.\n\u25cf find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials does not sufficiently support approval, or the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required for approval;\n\u25cf disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials performed by us or third parties;\n\u25cf determine the data collected from clinical trials are insufficient to support the submission or approval of an NDA or other applicable regulatory filing.\n\u25cf require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf identify deficiencies in the formulation, quality control, labeling or specifications of our current or future product candidates;\n\u25cf grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional post-approval clinical trials;\n\u25cf approve our current or any future product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested or with strong warnings that may affect marketability;\n\u25cf decline to approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, with monitoring requirements or distribution limitations. For example, it is possible that the FDA could require distribution controls in the approval, if any, of our product candidates to prevent inadvertent exposure to pregnant women;\n\u25cf decline to approve of the manufacturing processes, controls or facilities of third-party manufacturers or testing labs with whom we contract; or\n\u25cf change its approval policies or adopt new regulations in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for approval.\nAny delay, limitation or denial of any regulatory approval would adversely impact commercialization, our potential to generate revenue, our business and our operating results.\nDelays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials may result in additional costs and delays in our ability to generate significant revenues, and may delay or prevent our receipt of any regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our planned and future products.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue, or complete in a timely fashion clinical trials for Terra CoV-2 or our other product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Many companies are currently or will soon be researching, developing and testing therapeutic and vaccine product candidates specifically for or with potential application to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, which may reduce our ability to conduct clinical trials for our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine product candidate. For example, even if we are able to identify potential patients or eligibility criteria for a Terra CoV-2 clinical trial, patients who are otherwise eligible for such clinical trials may instead enroll in the clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 SARS-CoV-2 product candidates or opt not to enroll due to other competitive vaccines being administered by competitors based upon emergency use authorization.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u25cf the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf the eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u25cf the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u25cf the patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u25cf the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays, could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether and could delay or prevent our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and impede our ability to obtain additional financing.\nAny product candidates that we commercialize will be subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review.\nEven after we achieve U.S. regulatory approval for a product candidate, if any, we will be subject to continued regulatory review and compliance obligations. For example, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the approved indicated uses for which our product candidates may be marketed or on the conditions of approval. A product candidate\u2019s approval may contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies and surveillance, including Phase 4 clinical trials or a REMS to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. We will also be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review with respect to, among other things, the manufacturing, processing, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our product candidates. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, continued compliance with the FDA\u2019s good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and good laboratory practice requirements, which are regulations and guidelines the FDA would apply to all of our product candidates in clinical and preclinical development, along with any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval, and continued compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements pursuant to which manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. To the extent that a product candidate is approved for sale in other countries, we may be subject to similar restrictions and requirements imposed by laws and government regulators in those countries.\nIf we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u25cf impose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspend or withdraw product approvals or revoke necessary licenses;\n\u25cf issue warning letters, show cause notices or untitled letters describing alleged violations, which may be publicly available;\n\u25cf mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u25cf require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance; commence criminal investigations and prosecutions;\n\u25cf impose injunctions;\n\u25cf impose other civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf delay or refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u25cf refuse to permit drugs or active ingredients to be imported or exported to or from the United States;\n\u25cf suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u25cf seize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe regulations, policies or guidance of the FDA and other applicable government agencies may change and new or additional statutes or government regulations may prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur product candidates may cause serious or undesirable side effects or possess other unexpected properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of approved labeling or result in post-approval regulatory action.\nUnforeseen side effects from any of our product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after marketing such product. Undesirable side effects caused by product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, modify, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities. Results of clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nAdditionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects, or other previously unknown problems, caused by our product candidates after obtaining U.S. or foreign regulatory approval or other products with the same or related active ingredients, a number of potentially negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require a recall of the product or we may voluntarily recall a product;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require the addition of warnings or contraindications in the product labeling, narrowing of the indication in the product label or issuance of field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u25cf we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients or institute a REMS;\n\u25cf we may be subject to limitations as to how we promote the product;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way the product is administered or modify the product in some other way;\n\u25cf the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may require additional clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product;\n\u25cf sales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u25cf our brand and reputation may suffer.\nAny of the above events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for marketing and we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, or if physicians misuse our products or use our products off-label, we may become subject to prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, product liability claims and significant fines, penalties and sanctions, and our brand and reputation could be harmed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the marketing and promotional claims that are made about drug products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we are found to have promoted off-label uses of any of our product candidates, we may receive warning or untitled letters and become subject to significant liability, which would materially harm our business. Both federal and state governments have levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and have enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business. In addition, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our business operations, significant legal expenses could be incurred and our brand and reputation could be damaged. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we are deemed by the FDA to have engaged in the promotion of our products for off-label use, we could be subject to FDA regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they determine our business activities constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including criminal, civil or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our product candidates in ways that fall outside the scope of the approved indications, as he or she may deem appropriate in his or her medical judgment. Physicians may also misuse our product candidates or use improper techniques, which may lead to adverse results, side effects or injury and, potentially, subsequent product liability claims. Furthermore, the use of our product candidates for indications other than those cleared by the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our brand and reputation among both physicians and patients.\nWe may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nCertain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. We are subject to regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u25cf the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or in return for the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including, for example, the United States False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u25cf the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (i.e., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf HIPAA and related implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, with such information published on a searchable website on an annual basis; and\n\u25cf state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be provided to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the recently enacted ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.\nAchieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws or regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors and CROs may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors and CROs may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these persons could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates: laws or regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities; manufacturing standards; federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and data privacy; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations, and serious harm to our reputation. In addition, federal procurement laws impose substantial penalties for misconduct in connection with government contracts and require certain contractors to maintain a code of business ethics and conduct. If any such actions are instituted against us, we may have to terminate employees or others involved and the impact of such termination can result in our experiencing delays and additional costs associated with replacing the services being provided. If we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, FDA debarment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our operating results.\nEven if our current product candidates or any future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the broad degree of health care payers, physician and patient adoption and use necessary for commercial success.\nThe commercial success of any of our current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of the resulting product by health care payers, physicians and patients for approved indications, and may not be commercially successful. The degree and rate of physician and patient adoption of our current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which the product is approved and patient demand for approved products that treat those indications;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our product as compared to other available therapies;\n\u25cf the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from managed care plans and other healthcare payors for any of our product candidates that may be approved;\n\u25cf the cost of treatment with our product candidates in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for the product, if approved, on the part of patients;\n\u25cf acceptance by physicians, major operators of clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u25cf physician and patient willingness to adopt a new therapy over other available therapies to treat approved indications;\n\u25cf overcoming any biases physicians or patients may have toward particular therapies for the treatment of approved indications;\n\u25cf proper training and administration of our product candidates by physicians and medical staff;\n\u25cf patient satisfaction with the results and administration of our product candidates and overall treatment experience;\n\u25cf the willingness of patients to pay for certain of our product candidates relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times;\n\u25cf the revenue and profitability that our product candidate may offer a physician as compared to alternative therapies;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of side effects;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved labeling for our product candidates;\n\u25cf any FDA requirement to undertake a REMS;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u25cf adverse publicity about our product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products; and\n\u25cf potential product liability claims.\nIf any of our current or future product candidates are approved for use but fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption necessary for commercial success, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our operations.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, or any future products we may seek to commercialize, their commercial success may be severely hindered.\nAs to any of our product candidates that become available by prescription only, our success will depend on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product from third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. The availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private third-party payors is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. If any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate attractive efficacy profiles, they may not qualify for coverage and reimbursement. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our prescription-only products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.\nIn addition, the market for certain of our product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors\u2019 drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available.\nMoreover, third-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, although private third-party payors tend to follow Medicare, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions in both the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for any of our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIf our products do not receive favorable third-party reimbursement, or if new restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not generate significant revenues.\nOur ability to commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our proposed formulations and products and related treatments are obtained by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMOs. Reimbursement from third parties depends greatly on our ability to present data which demonstrate positive outcomes and reduced utilization of other products or services as well as cost data which show that treatment costs using the new product are equal to or less than what is currently covered for other products. If our products do not receive favorable third-party reimbursement and patients are unwilling or unable to pay for our products out-of-pocket, it could limit our revenues and harm our business.\nThe continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the United States, recent federal and state government initiatives have been directed at lowering the total cost of health care. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Federal and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform, controlling the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of such proposals could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)\nOur business is subject to risks arising from public health crises, epidemic or pandemic diseases, such as the recent global outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\nOur business operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, epidemics and pandemics. An epidemic or pandemic disease outbreak, including the recent COVID-19 outbreak, could cause significant disruption to our business operations or the operations of our third-party manufacturers and CROs upon whom we rely, as well as to our clinical trials, including as a result of significant restrictions or bans on travel into and within the countries in which our manufacturers produce our product candidates or where we conduct our clinical trials. Such disruption could impede, delay, limit or prevent our employees and CROs from continuing research and development activities, the production, delivery or release of our product candidates to our clinical trial sites, as well as clinical trial investigators, patients or other critical staff from traveling to or otherwise continuing to participate in our clinical trials, and delay data collection and analysis and other related activities, any of which could impede, delay, limit or prevent completion of our ongoing clinical trials and preclinical studies or commencement of new clinical trials, and ultimately lead to the delay or denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates, which would seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak could also potentially affect the business of the FDA, EMA or other health authorities, which could result in delays in meetings related to planned or completed clinical trials and ultimately of reviews and approvals of our product candidates. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures also have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including impairing our ability to raise capital when needed. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact. The severity of the coronavirus disease could also make access to our existing supply chain difficult or impossible and could materially impact our business. Any one or a combination of the aforementioned events could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to conduct clinical trials may be impeded, delayed, limited or prevented entirely due to the spread of COVID-19, the imposition of government restrictions and the concurrent disruptions to ordinary business activities globally.\nAs the U.S. and foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations continue to respond to the COVID-19 public health crisis, our ability to conduct clinical trials may impeded, delayed, limited or prevented entirely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others;\n\u25cf limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u25cf delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u25cf interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials;\n\u25cf changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u25cf delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; and\n\u25cf refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies outside the United States.\nThe global outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the COVID-19 coronavirus may impact our business and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread and density of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nOur business involves international components, and we are exposed to various global and local risks related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may involve international components such as clinical trial enrollment. Consequently, we may be exposed to, or our third-party contractors, suppliers or manufacturers may be exposed to, certain global events beyond our control, including war, public health crises, epidemics, pandemics, trade disputes, geopolitical conflicts and other international events, including, for example, the global impact of COVID-19 and the various responses taken by foreign authorities, such as government-imposed quarantines and other public health safety measures.\nThe extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. Moreover, the coronavirus outbreak has indeterminable adverse effects on general commercial activity and the world economy, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that this coronavirus or any other epidemic harms the global economy generally. The international components of our business may be directly subject to, and the domestic components may be indirectly impacted by, a variety of risks, including:\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf greater risk of uncollectible accounts;\n\u25cf longer collection cycles;\n\u25cf logistical and communications challenges;\n\u25cf potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices, including export license requirements, trade barriers, tariffs and tax laws;\n\u25cf changes in labor conditions;\n\u25cf burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u25cf political and economic instability;\n\u25cf increases in duties and taxation;\n\u25cf foreign tax laws and potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures;\n\u25cf greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property;\n\u25cf the risk of third-party disputes over ownership of intellectual property and infringement of third-party intellectual property by our products; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets.\nInternational markets are also affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Profitability from international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to regional economic conditions, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competing products, infrastructure development, intellectual property rights protection and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. We expect these risks will increase as we pursue our strategy to expand operations into new geographic markets. We may not succeed in developing and implementing effective policies and strategies in each location where we conduct business. Any failure to do so may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMacroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, the effectives of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may alter the ways in which we conduct our business operations and manage our financial capacities.\nTo varying degrees, the ways in which we conduct our business operations and manage our financial capacities are influenced by macroeconomic conditions that affect companies directly involved in or providing services related to the drug and biological product development. For example, real GDP growth, business and investor confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer and business financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect not only our decisions and ability to engage in research and development and clinical trials, but also those of our management, employees, third-party contractors, manufacturers and suppliers, competitors, shareholders and regulatory authorities. In addition, geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact the macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nEconomic uncertainty may adversely affect our access to capital, cost of capital and ability to execute our business plan as scheduled.\nGenerally, worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain. Access to capital markets is critical to our ability to operate. Traditionally, biotechnology companies have funded their research and development expenditures through raising capital in the equity markets. Declines and uncertainties in these markets in the past have severely restricted raising new capital and have affected companies\u2019 ability to continue to expand or fund existing research and development efforts. We require significant capital for research and development for our vaccine candidates and clinical trials. The general economic and capital market conditions, both in the U.S. and worldwide, have been volatile in the past and at times have adversely affected our access to capital and increased the cost of capital. There is no certainty that the capital and credit markets will be available to raise additional capital on favorable terms. If economic conditions become worse, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms, our ability to execute our business plan as scheduled would be compromised. Moreover, we rely and intend to rely on third-parties, including clinical research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and other important vendors and consultants. Global economic conditions may result in a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors and suppliers. If such third-parties are unable to adequately satisfy their contractual commitments to us in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies in light of the coronavirus pandemic could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. Moreover, at this time, we cannot predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak will impact the resources of such government agencies, including, in particular, the public health resources available to the FDA. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, in our operations as a public company, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe issuance of additional equity securities by us in the future would result in dilution to our existing common shareholders.\nOur board of directors has authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or a part of our authorized but unissued shares, except where shareholder approval is required by law. Any issuance of additional equity securities by us in the future could result in dilution to our existing common shareholders. Such issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium to the then-current trading price of our common stock. In addition, our business strategy may include expansion through internal growth by acquiring complementary businesses, acquiring or licensing additional products or brands, or establishing strategic relationships with targeted customers and suppliers. In order to do so, or to finance the cost of our other activities, we may issue additional equity securities that could result in further dilution to our existing common shareholders. These issuances would dilute the percentage ownership interest of our existing common shareholders, which would have the effect of reducing their influence on matters on which our shareholders vote, and might dilute the book value of our common stock. For example, we issued 16,666,668 shares of common stock, short-term warrants to purchase up to 9,583,334 shares of common stock, and long-term warrants to purchase up to 9,583,334 shares of common stock, as part of our March 25, 2019 underwritten public offering. In November and December of 2020, we issued 16,317,567 and 14,444,444 shares of common stock, respectively, in connection with an underwritten public offering and a registered direct offering. In connection with an at-the-market sale of shares of our common stock between February 2 and February 11, 2021 we issued an additional 15,406,618 shares of our common stock and issued 2,472,573 shares pursuant to warrant exercises. As a result, our outstanding shares of common stock has increased significantly from 29,433,135 shares as of December 31, 2018 to 91,766,928 shares as of December 31, 2020 and 109,646,119 as of February 25, 2021.\nOur financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition, we may not be able to predict our future revenues or results of operations. We base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs vary to the extent of our research and development and the candidate of clinical trials. As a result, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses associated with our research and development efforts of our product candidates under development. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly results include:\n\u25cf the timing of release of pre-clinical and clinical trial results and new products and services by our competitors, particularly those that may represent a significant portion of revenues in any given period;\n\u25cf the popularity of new vaccine products, and products released in prior periods;\n\u25cf changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf our success in entering new geographic markets;\n\u25cf decisions by us to incur additional expenses, such as commencing a clinical trial or increases in research and development or cessation of development of any of our product candidates under development;\n\u25cf the level of expenses associated with our regulatory applications or compliance and clinical trials; and\n\u25cf the timing of compensation expense associated with equity compensation grants.\nAs a result of these and other factors, our quarterly and annual operating results could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, our operating results may not meet the expectations of research analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly.\nOur Series A and Series B preferred stock, if not converted into common stock, has a distribution and liquidation preference senior to our common stock in liquidation which could negatively affect the value of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital.\nOn February 11, 2021, we provided a redemption notice to the holder of all our outstanding shares of our Series C Preferred Stock. Shares of our Series C Preferred Stock will be redeemed on March 13, 2021 and no longer be outstanding.\nOur Series A and Series B Preferred Stock, if not converted into Common Stock, have distribution and liquidation preferences senior to our common stock.\nOn November 8, 2017, we issued $3.3 million of Series B Non-Voting, Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) pursuant to which upon Liquidation each holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, after payment to the Series C Preferred Stock, but on par with Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and in preference to the holders of Common Stock, an amount of cash equal to the greater of (i) the product of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock then held by such holder, multiplied by the Series B Original Issue Price; and (ii) the amount that would be payable to such holder in the Liquidation in respect of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock if all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation.\nIn May and July of 2017, we issued an aggregate of $3.0 million of Series A Non-Voting, Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) pursuant to which upon Liquidation each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, after payment to the Series C Preferred Stock, but on par with Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and in preference to the holders of Common Stock, an amount of cash equal to the greater of (i) the product of the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then held by such holder, multiplied by the Series B Original Issue Price; and (ii) the amount that would be payable to such holder in the Liquidation in respect of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation.\nAs such, our Series C preferred stock is senior to all other classes of stock in distribution and liquidation and our Series A and Series B preferred stock, if not converted into common stock, will also be senior to our common stock in distribution and liquidation if such shares are not converted into common stock, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, and Series B Preferred Stock and the exercise of currently outstanding warrants could result in significant dilution to the holders of our common stock.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may convert their shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding: (i) 9,417,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, which are convertible into 941,701 shares of common stock and (ii) 6,600,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 1,320,002 shares of common stock. In addition to our outstanding shares of preferred stock, as of December 31, 2020, there were currently outstanding warrants to purchase 20,513,145 shares of our common stock. The conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, as well as the exercise of our outstanding warrants could result in significant dilution to existing common shareholders, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur stockholders may not realize a benefit from our acquisition of Noachis Terra commensurate with the ownership dilution experienced in connection with the acquisition.\nIn May 2020, in connection with our acquisition of Noachis Terra, the former sole shareholder received the following: (i) cash consideration of approximately $1,925,000; (ii) 9,200,000 restricted shares of the Company\u2019s common stock; and (iii) warrants to purchase 9,200,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which warrants and may not be exercised until May 1, 2021. In addition to the above consideration, the former sole shareholder also received the right to receive contingent consideration based upon the exercise of certain of the Company\u2019s outstanding warrants.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws, executive employment agreements and stock option plan may prevent a change of control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws, executive employment agreements and stock option plan may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u25cf authorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors without shareholder approval and that may be substantially dilutive or contain preferences or rights objectionable to an acquirer;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to amend the bylaws without shareholder approval;\n\u25cf vacancies on our Board may only be filled by the remaining directors and not our shareholders;\n\u25cf requirements that only our Board, our President or holders of more than 10% of our shares can call a special meeting of shareholders;\n\u25cf obligations to make certain payments under executive employment agreements in the event of a change of control and termination of employment; and\n\u25cf immediate vesting of all outstanding stock options.\nAs a result, these provisions could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium and limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. However, in our articles of incorporation we expressly elected not to be governed by Sections 607.0901 and 607.0902 of the Florida Business Corporation Act, which are statutory anti-takeover provisions relating to affiliated transactions and control share acquisitions, respectively. As such, we do not have the protection of these statutes in connection with any unwanted takeover attempts which could have the effect of encouraging an attempted change of control without first negotiating with our Board of Directors.\nThe price and volume of our common stock has been volatile and fluctuates substantially, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically been, and may in the future be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf announcements by us of the results of our pending COVID-19 vaccine development program or our competitors or their COVID-19 development programs;\n\u25cf our level of, and expected future use of, working capital;\n\u25cf the additional sale of common stock by us in capital raising transactions.\n\u25cf quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf our perceived funding needs;\n\u25cf the results of testing, technological innovations, or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf governmental regulations, rules, and orders;\n\u25cf general conditions in the health care, biotechnology or biopharmaceutical industries;\n\u25cf changes in market or trading conditions in light of economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf comments, research reports and/or earnings estimates by securities analysts;\n\u25cf developments concerning patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf litigation or public concern about the safety of our products;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments or vaccines being brought to the market under the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization;\n\u25cf additions or departures of directors, officers and key personnel;\n\u25cf release of transfer restrictions on our outstanding shares of common stock or sales of additional shares of common stock;\n\u25cf potential litigation initiated against us.\nOur stock price has been, and in the future may be, subject to substantial volatility. For example, our stock traded within a range of a high volume of 112,665,800 and a low volume of 254,900 per share for the period of January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders could incur substantial losses.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above your initial purchase price. Broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nIf our quarterly or annual results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nIn addition, public statements by us, government agencies, the media or others relating to the coronavirus outbreak (including regarding efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine) have in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in significant fluctuations in our stock price. Given the global focus on the coronavirus outbreak, any information in the public arena on this topic, whether or not accurate, could have an outsized impact (either positive or negative) on our stock price. Information related to our development, manufacturing and distribution efforts with respect to Terra CoV-2, or information regarding such efforts by competitors with respect to their vaccines, may also impact our stock price.\nOur stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in our filings incorporated by reference herein or in future periodic reports; variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates; and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock has been in the past and may continue to be volatile. In the past, other publicly-traded companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of securities law-related litigation in the future, and such litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nFuture sales or issuances of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception of such sales, could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. We may sell large quantities of our common stock at any time pursuant to in one or more separate offerings. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock. We have recently issued a significant number of shares of common stock and the number of outstanding shares has increased from 29,433,135 shares as of December 31, 2018 to 91,766,928, shares as of December 31, 2020, and inclusive of the shares of our common stock issued in connection with our acquisition of Noachis Terra, 109,646,119 outstanding shares of our common stock as of February 25, 2021. In addition, there were 16,017,000 shares of our Preferred stock outstanding which are convertible into 2,261,703 shares of our common stock and, as of December 31, 2020, warrants to purchase an additional 20,513,145 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants to investors, inclusive of the warrants to purchase 9,200,000 shares of our common stock issued in connection with our acquisition of Noachis Terra which will be exercisable on May 1, 2021. There were also 5,801,349 shares issuable upon exercise of options outstanding and an additional 2,207,901 shares available for option grants under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan is covered by Form S-8 registration statements we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and upon exercise of the options, such shares may be resold into the market. We have also issued shares of common stock and warrants in connection with previous private placements. Such shares are available for resale as well as certain of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. We have also issued shares of our common stock in the private placement and financing transaction, which are deemed to be \u201crestricted securities,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, and such shares may be resold pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six-month holding period: (i) affiliated shareholders, or shareholders whose shares are aggregated, may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii) non-affiliated shareholders may sell without such limitations, in each case provided we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates that have satisfied a one-year holding period without any limitation or restriction. We are unable to estimate the number of shares that may be sold because this will depend on the market price for our common stock, the personal or business circumstances of sellers and other factors.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified members for our Board of Directors.\nAs a public company, we are already subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations may increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs; may make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly; and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costlier. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors and Board committees or as executive officers.\nAs a public company we are also required to assess our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and file periodic reports with the SEC. If we are unable to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, or if material weaknesses or significant deficiencies persist, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or regulatory investigations, which could harm our business. We must perform an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the SEC reporting requirements in a timely manner, or if we note or identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. As a smaller reporting company, we do not have to have our independent registered public accounting firm report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If in the future we no longer meet the requirements of a smaller reporting company, our independent registered public accounting firm will have to report on our internal controls over financial reporting. There can be no assurance that our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify material weaknesses which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud which could subject us to regulatory sanctions, harm our business and operating results and cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\nEffective internal controls required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business, reputation and operating results could be harmed. We have discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal controls that need improvement. We cannot be certain that the measures we have taken or intend to take will ensure that we maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could subject us to regulatory sanctions, harm our business and operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also harm our reputation and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to be listed on the NYSE American.\nOur common stock commenced trading on the NYSE American (formerly the NYSE MKT) on April 10, 2013, and we are subject to certain NYSE American continued listing requirements and standards. We may also incur costs that we have not previously incurred for expenses for compliance with the rules and requirements of the NYSE American. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to satisfy the requirements of the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing standards. A delisting of our common stock could negatively affect the price and liquidity of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital in the future.\nWe will continue to incur significant costs as a result of and devote substantial management time to operating as a public company listed on the NYSE American.\nAs a public company listed on the NYSE American, we incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur before when trading on the OTCQB Marketplace. For example, we are subject to the rules and regulations required by the NYSE American, including changes in corporate governance practices and minimum listing requirements. These requirements have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have and will continue to render some activities more time-consuming and costlier. In addition, our management and other personnel have diverted and will continue to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these listing requirements and failure to meet these requirements could lead to an adverse effect on the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part upon the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business from time to time. If one or more of the analysts who seek to cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage, once commenced, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe may issue debt or debt securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, guarantees, preferred stock, hybrid securities, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and securities would receive distributions of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings may be influenced by market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings or debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d have a public float of less than $250 million and have annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are subject to lesser disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers. Specifically, \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.", "PERMNO": 90170, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "OGEN"}
