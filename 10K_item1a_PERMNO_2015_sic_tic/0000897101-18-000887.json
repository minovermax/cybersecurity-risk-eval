{"cik": "37472", "company": "FLEXSTEEL INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-09-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company is subject to a variety of risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Should any of these risks actually materialize, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted. There may be additional factors that are presently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial that could affect its business.\nBusiness information systems could be impacted by disruptions and security breaches.\nThe Company employs information technology systems to support global business. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise information belonging to the Company and its customers and suppliers and expose the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain areas of its businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. While security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure could happen, none have occurred to date that have had a material impact to the Company. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe implementation of a new business information system could disrupt the business.\nThe Company completed the first of two deployments of its new business information system, SAP S/4 HANA in fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 retiring one of the Company\u2019s legacy systems. The second deployment is expected during fiscal year 2020. Once fully implemented, SAP S/4 HANA will enable the Company to better meet market conditions, customer requirements and increase operating efficiency.\nAn ineffective implementation of the new business information system may result in the following:\n\u25cf Disruption of the Company\u2019s domestic and international supply chain;\n\u25cf Inability to fill customer orders accurately and on a timely basis;\n\u25cf Inability to process payments to suppliers and vendors;\n\u25cf Negative impact on financials;\n\u25cf Inability to fulfill federal, state and local tax filing requirements in a timely and accurate matter; and\n\u25cf Increased demands of management and associates to the detriment of other corporate initiatives.\nFuture success depends on the Company\u2019s ability to manage its global supply chain.\nThe Company acquires raw materials, component parts and certain finished products from external suppliers, both U.S. and foreign. Many of these suppliers are dependent upon other suppliers in countries other than where they are located. This global interdependence within the Company\u2019s supply chain is subject to delays in delivery, availability, quality, pricing, and changes in international trade policies including tariffs. The delivery of goods from these suppliers may be delayed by customs, labor issues, changes in political, economic and social conditions, weather, laws and regulations. Unfavorable fluctuations in price, international trade policies, quality, delivery and availability of these products could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet demands of customers and cause negative impacts to the Company\u2019s cost structure, profitability and its cash flow.\nCompetition from U.S. and foreign finished product manufacturers may adversely affect the business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. The Company competes with U.S. and foreign manufacturers and distributors. As a result, the Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to competitive pressures or increasing costs. Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, the Company may not be able to significantly differentiate its products (through styling, finish and other construction techniques) from those of its competitors. As a result, the Company is continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower its sales and earnings.\nFuture costs of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to various laws and regulations which could have a significant impact on operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, inadvertently failing to comply with such laws and regulations could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s participation in multi-employer pension plans may have exposures under those plans that could extend beyond what its obligations would be with respect to its employees.\nThe Company participates in, and makes periodic contributions to, three multi-employer pension plans that cover union employees. Multi-employer pension plans are managed by trustee boards comprised of participating employer and labor union representatives, and the employers participating in a multi-employer pension plan are jointly responsible for maintaining the plan\u2019s funding requirements. Based on the most recent information available to the Company, the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in one of the multi-employer pension plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. As a result of the Company\u2019s participation, it could experience greater volatility in the overall pension funding obligations. The Company\u2019s obligations may be impacted by the funded status of the plans, the plans\u2019 investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\nFuture results may be affected by various legal proceedings and compliance risk, including those involving product liability, environmental, or other matters.\nThe Company faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event the use of any of its products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event any of the Company\u2019s products prove to be defective, it may be required to recall or redesign such products. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. The Company could incur substantial costs, including legal expenses, as a result of the noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, environmental laws. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, these various legal proceedings and compliance matters could have a material impact on the business, operating results and financial condition. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to recruit and retain key employees and highly-skilled workers in a competitive labor market.\nIf the Company is not successful in recruiting and retaining key employees and highly-skilled workers or experiences the unexpected loss of those employees, the operations may be negatively impacted.\nFailure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer or designer tastes and fashions in a timely manner could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and decrease sales and earnings.\nFurniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing consumer and end-user trends and tastes and is highly fashion oriented. If the Company is not able to acquire sufficient fabric variety or if the Company is unable to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends, it may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices.\nThe Company\u2019s products are considered deferrable purchases for consumers during economic downturns. Prolonged negative economic conditions could impact the business.\nEconomic downturns and prolonged negative economic conditions could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings and contract products. These events could impact retailers, offices, hospitality, recreational vehicle seating and healthcare businesses resulting in an impact on the Company\u2019s business. A recovery in the Company\u2019s sales could lag significantly behind a general economic recovery due to the deferrable nature and relatively significant cost of home furnishings and contract products purchases.\nTerms of collective bargaining agreements and labor disruptions could adversely impact results of operations.\nTerms of collective bargaining agreements that prevent the Company from competing effectively could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company is committed to working with those groups to avert or resolve conflicts as they arise. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful.", "PERMNO": 36768, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "FLXS"}
