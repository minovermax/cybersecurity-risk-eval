{"cik": "896841", "company": "AVID TECHNOLOGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. If any of the following risks were to actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results would likely suffer, possibly materially, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, and actions taken in response to it have adversely affected our business and are likely to continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is causing worldwide concern and economic disruption, and has led to federal, state and local governments enacting various restrictions in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. This has included the declaration of states of emergency across the globe, and widespread school and business closings affecting a large number of countries. It has also prompted limitations on social or public gatherings and other social distancing measures, such as office closures, shelter in place orders, working remotely, travel restrictions and quarantines, some of which continue in effect in many cities and countries.\nIn these challenging and dynamic circumstances, Avid is working to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its operations. We have taken, and may take in the future, actions as required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, manufacturers, and suppliers that diminish our ability to promote our products and services, and deliver required on-site professional services, including on-site support to our customers and users, and that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19, along with restrictions enacted to limit its spread, have caused economic disruptions and slowdowns in many countries. This economic downturn has caused a decline in the media, entertainment, and sports industries which has, in turn, reduced demand for our products and services. These factors are expected to continue to reduce demand for our products and services, possibly significantly, including causing delays in purchasing and projects by our enterprise customers and channel partners. Additionally, the provision of on-site professional service may be impossible for a prolonged period of time, further impacting our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also had an adverse impact on our operations and supply chain, and adverse impacts could continue during the pandemic. We could experience interruptions as a result of employees or other key personnel of manufacturers, ours or those of third parties, becoming infected. Such workplace interruptions have also been caused by preventive and precautionary measures that governments and we and other businesses, including our third-party manufacturers, are taking, such as border closures, prolonged quarantines, and other travel restrictions. For example, we do not know if all of our manufacturers will be able to continue producing materials for us or may be shut down. Any of the above circumstances will negatively impact the ability of third parties on which we rely to manufacture our products or their components and our ability to perform critical functions, which could significantly hamper our ability to supply our products to our customers. If we encounter delays or difficulties in the manufacturing process that disrupt our ability to supply our products, we may not be able to satisfy customer demand or we may experience a product stock-out, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf the pandemic continues and economic conditions worsen, we expect to experience additional adverse impacts on our operations and revenues and our collections of accounts receivable, which adverse impacts may be material. To address our liquidity, we obtained funding under the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, and will continue to explore other options, including other programs that may be implemented by the U.S. government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there can be no assurance that we will obtain any funds from these or future programs. We have also implemented cost reduction measures, including halting all but essential travel spending, reducing discretionary spending, deferring certain investments, and reducing our payroll expenses. Such cost reductions may not be sufficient and additionally may harm our ability to offer, promote, and deliver products and services at the level expected by our customers and partners.\nFurther, the continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which may increase the cost of capital and adversely impact access to capital. If we experience further deterioration in demand and our cash flows from operations decrease, we may require additional funding and may not be able to obtain such funding on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results going forward will depend on future developments, which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of COVID-19, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our business and damage our results of operations and our liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree.\nA natural disaster or catastrophic event may significantly limit our ability to conduct business as normal and harm our business.\nOur operations, and the operations of our customers, are vulnerable to interruptions by natural disasters and catastrophic events, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic discussed in the preceding risk factor. We operate a complex, geographically dispersed business, which includes significant personnel, customers and facilities in California near major earthquake fault lines. We may not be able to protect our company from, and we are predominantly uninsured for, business continuity losses and disruptions caused by such catastrophic events. Disruption or failure of our or our customers\u2019 networks or systems, or injury or damage to either parties\u2019 personnel or physical infrastructure, caused by a natural disaster, public health crisis, terrorism, cyber-attack, act of war, or other catastrophic event may significantly limit our or our customers\u2019 ability to conduct business as normal, including our ability to communicate and transact with customers, suppliers, distributors, and resellers, which may negatively affect our revenues and operating results. Additionally, a natural disaster or catastrophic event could cause us or our customers to suspend all or a portion of operations for a significant period of time, result in a permanent loss of resources, and require the relocation of personnel and material to alternate facilities that may not be available or adequate. Such an event could also cause an indirect economic impact on our customers, which could affect our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions and reduce demand for our products and services. There could also be disruptions to our supply chain as a result of such events. We may also experience disruption to our internal operations if we are forced to restrict employee travel, cancel events with customers or partners, or even close office facilities as a result of such events. Any significant disruption resulting from such events on a large scale or over a prolonged period of time could cause significant delays and disruption to our business until the Company would be able to resume normal business operations or shift to other third-party vendors, negatively affecting our revenue and other financial results. A prolonged disruption of our business could also damage our reputation, particularly among our global news organization customers who are likely to require our solutions and support during such time. Any of these factors could cause a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur success depends in significant part on our ability to offer innovative products and solutions in response to dynamic and rapidly evolving market demand.\nTo succeed in our market, we must offer innovative products and solutions. Innovation requires that we accurately predict future market trends and customer expectations, and that we quickly adapt our development efforts in response. We must also protect our product roadmap and new product initiatives from leaks that might reduce or eliminate any innovative edge that we seek. Predicting market trends is difficult because our market is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Additionally, given the complex, sophisticated nature of our solutions and our typically lengthy product development cycles, we may not be able to rapidly change our product direction or strategic course. If we are unable to accurately predict market trends or adapt to evolving market conditions, we may be unable to capture customer demand and our market reputation and financial performance will be negatively affected. Even to the extent we make accurate predictions and possess the requisite flexibility to adapt, we may be able to pursue only some of the possible innovations due to limited resources. Our success, therefore, further depends on our ability to identify and focus on the most promising innovations.\nOur success also depends on our ability to manage a number of risks associated with new products that we introduce, including timely and successful product launch, market acceptance, and the availability of products in appropriate locations, quantities, and costs to meet demand. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful in the near future, or at all, or that our competitors will not take significant market share in similar efforts. If we fail to develop new products and to manage new product introductions and transitions properly, our financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nOur increased emphasis on a cloud strategy may give rise to risks that could harm our business.\nOur cloud strategy requires continued investment in product development and cloud operations, where we have a limited operating history. Our cloud strategy has also led to changes in the way we price and deliver our products. Many of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their larger presence, larger developer network, deeper experience in the cloud-based computing market, and greater sales and marketing resources. It is uncertain whether our cloud strategy will prove successful, or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. Our cloud strategy may give rise to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022if new or current customers desire only perpetual licenses, we may not be successful in selling subscriptions;\n\u2022although we intend to support our perpetual license business, the increased emphasis on a cloud strategy may raise concerns among our installed customer base;\n\u2022we may be unsuccessful in achieving our target pricing;\n\u2022our revenues might decline over the short or long term as a result of this strategy;\n\u2022our relationships with existing partners that resell perpetual licenses may be damaged; and\n\u2022we may incur costs at a higher than forecasted rate as we enhance and expand our cloud operations.\nCertain of our enterprise offerings have long and complex sales cycles, which could result in a loss of customers and lower revenues.\nWith our transition to leveraging the Avid MediaCentral platform in our sales process, we have experienced longer and more complex sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings. The length and complexity in these sales cycles are due to a number of factors, including, among other things, the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the uses and benefits of our products and services, the desire of large and medium size organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures, and the need to negotiate large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts. These longer and more complex sales cycles could result in a loss of customers and lower revenues.\nWe spend substantial time and money on our sales efforts without any assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue. Our long and complex sales cycle for these products makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.\nThere are a number of financial and accounting risks in our subscription model.\nA growing portion of our revenue is subscription-based pursuant to service and subscription agreements that are generally month-to-month or one year in length, and we intend to continue to expand our subscription-based offerings. Although the subscription model is designed to increase the number of customers who purchase our products and services on a recurring basis and create a more predictable revenue stream, there are certain risks inherent in a subscription-based model. These risks include the risk that customers will not renew their subscriptions, risks related to the timing of revenue recognition, and the risk of potential reductions in cash flows. Although many of our service and subscription agreements contain automatic renewal terms, generally, our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period. If customers do renew their subscriptions, these subscriptions may not be renewed on the same terms. Moreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their service agreements prior to the expiration of the terms of their agreements. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenues may decline. Our future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional features and services to our current customers, which depends on a number of factors, including customers' satisfaction with our products and services, the prices of our offerings, and general economic conditions. If our efforts to cross-sell and upsell to our customers are unsuccessful, the rate at which our business grows may decline.\nA portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. If we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results\nmight not reflect such downturns until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues from subscription-based services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Further, any increases in sales under our subscription sales model could result in decreased revenues over the short term if these sales are offset by a decline in sales from perpetual license customers. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our new businesses or our addition of a subscription-based model prove incorrect, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. We may be unable accurately to predict subscription renewal rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.\nWe operate in highly fragmented and competitive markets, and our competitors may be able to draw upon a greater depth and breadth of resources than those available to us.\nWe operate in highly fragmented and competitive markets characterized by pressure to innovate, expand feature sets and functionality, accelerate new product releases, and reduce prices. Markets for certain of our products have limited barriers to entry. Also, the fragmentation in our markets creates an additional risk of consolidation among our competitors, which would result in fewer, more effective competitors. Customers consider many factors when evaluating our products relative to those of our competitors, including innovation, ease of use, price, feature sets, functionality, reliability, performance, reputation, and training and support, and we may not compare favorably against our competitors in all respects. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and support resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to deliver greater innovation, respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in market demand, devote more resources to the development, marketing and sale of their products, successfully expand into emerging and other international markets, or price their products more aggressively than we can. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing products, or in attracting and retaining customers, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe obtain certain hardware product components and finished goods under sole-source supply arrangements, and disruptions to these arrangements could jeopardize the manufacturing or distribution of certain of our hardware products.\nAlthough we generally prefer to establish multi-source supply arrangements for our hardware product components and finished goods, multi-source arrangements are not always possible or cost-effective. We consequently depend on sole-source suppliers for many hardware product components and finished goods, including some critical items. We do not generally carry significant inventories of, and may not in all cases have guaranteed supply arrangements for, these sole-sourced items. Our sole-source suppliers may cease, suspend, or otherwise limit production or shipment of our product components, due to, among other things, macroeconomic events, political crises, or natural or environmental disasters or other occurrences, or they may terminate our agreements or adversely modify supply terms or pricing. If any of these events occur, our ability to manufacture, distribute, and service our products would be impaired, and our business could be significantly harmed. We may not be able to obtain sole-sourced components or finished goods, or acceptable substitutes, from alternative suppliers or on commercially reasonable terms. If we are forced to change sole-source suppliers due to a contract termination or other production cessation, it may take a significant amount of time and expenses to obtain substitute suppliers, during which time our inventory may be significantly reduced, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be required to expend significant development resources to redesign our products to work around the exclusion of any sole-sourced component or accommodate the inclusion of any substitute component. Although we have procedures in place to mitigate the risks associated with our sole-sourced suppliers, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain sole-sourced components or finished goods from alternative suppliers or that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms without a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nWe depend on the availability and proper functioning of certain third-party technology that we incorporate into or bundle with our products. Third-party technology may include defects or errors that could adversely affect the performance of our products. If third-party technology becomes unavailable at acceptable prices, we may need to expend considerable resources integrating alternative third-party technology or developing our own substitute technology.\nThe profit margin for some of our products depends in part on the royalty, license, and purchase fees we pay in connection with third-party technology which we license for incorporation into our bundling with our products. To the extent we add additional third-party technology to our products and we are unable to offset associated costs, our profit margins may decline, and our\noperating results may suffer. In addition to cost implications, third-party technology may include defects or errors that could adversely affect the performance of our products, which may harm our market reputation or adversely affect our product sales. Third-party technology may also include certain open source software code that if used in combination with our own software may jeopardize our intellectual property rights or limit our ability to sell through certain sales channels. If any third-party technology license expires, is terminated, or ceases to be available on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to expend considerable resources integrating alternative third-party technology or developing our own substitute technology. In the interim, sales of our products may be delayed or suspended, or we may be forced to distribute our products with reduced feature sets or functionality.\nOur products may experience defects that could negatively impact our customer relationships, market reputation, and operating results.\nOur software products occasionally include coding defects (commonly referred to as \u201cbugs\u201d), which in some cases may interfere with or impair a customer\u2019s ability to operate or use the software. Similarly, our hardware products could include design or manufacturing defects that could cause them to malfunction. The quality control measures we use are not designed or intended to detect and remedy all defects. Any product defects could result in loss of customers or revenues, delays in revenue recognition, increased product returns, damage to our market reputation, and significant warranty or other expense and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nLengthy procurement lead times and unpredictable life cycles and customer demand for some of our products may result in significant inventory risks.\nWith respect to many of our products, particularly our audio products, we must procure component parts and build finished inventory far in advance of product shipments. Certain of these products may have unpredictable life cycles and encounter rapid technological obsolescence as a result of dynamic market conditions. We procure product components and build inventory based upon our forecasts of product life cycle and customer demand. If we are unable to accurately forecast product life cycle and customer demand or unable to manage our inventory levels in response to shifts in customer demand, the result may be insufficient, excess, or obsolete product inventory. Insufficient product inventory may impair our ability to fulfill product orders and negatively affect our revenues, while excess or obsolete inventory may require a write-down on products and components to their net realizable value, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur revenues and operating results depend significantly on our third-party reseller and distribution channels. Our failure to effectively manage our distribution channels for our products and services could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins and therefore our profitability.\nWe distribute many of our products indirectly through third-party resellers and distributors. We also distribute products directly to end-user customers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer industries for our products and services is a complex process. For example, in response to our direct sales strategies or for other business reasons, our current resellers and distributors may from time to time choose to resell our competitors\u2019 products in addition to, or in place of, our products. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to identify and implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins and therefore our profitability.\nPotential acquisitions could be difficult to consummate and integrate into our operations, and they could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, or impair our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time we may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of or investments in new or complementary businesses, technologies, or products that we believe can improve our ability to compete in our existing customer markets or allow us to enter new markets. There are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and investment transactions including, but not limited to, failing to realize anticipated returns on investment, unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with the acquisition, and difficulty assimilating the operations, policies and personnel of the acquired company.\nOur revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate from period to period.\nOur results of operations have been, and may continue to, be subject to significant quarterly variation. Our revenues and operating results for any particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those enumerated under the section \u201cCautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and:\n\u2022the timing of large or enterprise-wide sales and our ability to recognize revenues from such sales;\n\u2022demand planning and logistics;\n\u2022renewal rates under subscription contracts;\n\u2022reliance on third-party reseller and distribution channels;\n\u2022disruptions in our supply chain;\n\u2022changes in operating expenses;\n\u2022price protections and provisions for inventory obsolescence extended to resellers and distributors;\n\u2022seasonal factors, such as higher consumer demand at year-end; and\n\u2022complex accounting rules for revenue recognition.\nThe occurrence and interaction of these variables may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from period to period. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not provide an adequate indication of our future performance. We cannot be certain when, or if, our operations will be profitable in future periods.\nOur revenue backlog estimates are based on certain assumptions and are subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations, and backlog orders may not be timely converted to revenues in any particular fiscal period, if at all, or be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period.\nOur revenue backlog, as we define it, consists of firm orders received and includes both (i) orders where the customer has paid in advance of our performance obligations being fulfilled, which are reflected as deferred revenues on our balance sheet, and (ii) orders for future product deliveries or services that have not yet been invoiced by us. To the extent that our customers cancel their orders with us, or reduce their requirements during a particular period for any reason, we will not realize revenue or profit from the associated revenue backlog. Even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the customer may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us. Material delays, payment defaults, or cancellations could reduce the amount of revenue backlog currently reported, and consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues. Furthermore, orders included in our revenue backlog may not be profitable. We may experience variances in the realization of our revenue backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from external market factors and economic factors beyond our control. In addition, even if we realize all of the revenue from the projects in our revenue backlog, if our expenses associated with these projects are higher than expected, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur intellectual property and trade secrets are valuable assets that may be subject to third-party infringement and misappropriation.\nAs a technology company, our intellectual property and trade secrets are among our most valuable assets. Infringement or misappropriation of these assets can result in lost revenues, and thereby ultimately reduce their value. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and anti-piracy technology in certain of our products to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets. Most of these tools require vigilant monitoring of competitor and other third-party activities and of end-user usage of our products to be effective. These tools may not provide adequate protection in all instances, may be subject to circumvention, or may require a vigilance that in some cases exceeds our capabilities or resources. Additionally, our business model is increasingly focused on software products and, as we offer more software products, our revenues may be more vulnerable to loss through piracy. While we may seek to engage with those potentially infringing our intellectual property to negotiate a license for use, we also may seek legal recourse. As noted in more detail above, the legal regimes of certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property or trade secrets to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. If our intellectual property or trade secrets are misappropriated in foreign jurisdictions, we may be without adequate remedies to address these issues. Regardless of jurisdiction, assuming legal protection exists, and infringement or misappropriation is detected, any enforcement action that we may pursue could be costly and time-consuming, the outcome will be uncertain, and the alleged offender in some cases may seek to have our\nintellectual property rights invalidated. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets, our business could be harmed.\nOur results could be materially adversely affected if we are accused of, or found to be, infringing third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nBecause of technological change in our industry, extensive and sometimes uncertain patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain of our products or business methods may infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Companies in the technology industry own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. We have received claims and have been subject to litigation alleging that we infringe patents owned by third parties, and we may in the future be subject to such claims and litigation. Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents, or the merits of any patent claims by potential or actual litigants, we could incur substantial costs in defending intellectual property claims and litigation, and such claims and litigation could distract management\u2019s attention from normal business operations. In addition, we provide indemnification provisions in agreements with certain customers covering potential claims by third parties of intellectual property infringement. These agreements generally provide that we will indemnify customers for losses incurred in connection with an infringement claim brought by a third party with respect to our products, and we have received claims for such indemnification. The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we are, or may become, a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to:\n\u2022cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;\n\u2022obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology, which such license could require royalties that would significantly increase our cost of goods sold; or redesign products or services to avoid infringement, where such redesign could involve significant costs and result in delayed and/or reduced sales of the affected products.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity and Financial Condition and Performance\nIf we are not able to generate and maintain adequate liquidity our ability to operate our business could be adversely affected.\nGenerating and maintaining adequate liquidity is important to our business operations. We meet our liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by operations, supplemented from time to time with the proceeds of long-term debt and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, or New Credit Facility, governed by the credit agreement, dated January 5, 2021, among us, the lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement. We have the ability to borrow up to $70.0 million under the New Credit Facility. We have also undertaken significant cost cutting measures and we may take additional measures to further improve our liquidity. Significant fluctuations in our cash balances could harm our ability to meet our immediate liquidity needs, impair our capacity to react to sudden or unexpected contractions or growth in our business, reduce our ability to withstand a sustained period of economic crisis, and impair our ability to compete with competitors with greater financial resources. In addition, fluctuations in our cash balances could cause us to draw on our New Credit Facility and therefore reduce available funds under the New Credit Facility (see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 of this Form 10-K). If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or our borrowings are not sufficient, our liquidity may significantly decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRestrictions in the Credit Agreement may limit our activities.\nThe Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to make investments, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, pay dividends and make other restricted payments, and create liens. We are also required to comply on an ongoing basis with certain financial covenants, including a maximum total net leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and could be affected by the levels of our cash flows from\noperations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which could permit acceleration of the outstanding term loans and New Credit Facility borrowings under the Credit Agreement and require us to repay such indebtedness before its scheduled due date. Certain events of default under the Credit Agreement may also give rise to a default under other future indebtedness. If an event of default were to occur, we might not have sufficient funds available to make the payments required. If we are unable to repay amounts owed, our lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell substantially all of our assets, which secure our borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, cash flow and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $207.7 million of indebtedness, including borrowings under our Financing Agreement, which was terminated in connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement. This substantial level of indebtedness may:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments, and use for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates with respect to borrowings under the Credit Agreement that bear interest at variable rates or when our indebtedness is being refinanced;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing; and\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels and borrowing costs.\nWe cannot make any assurance that our cash flow from operations, combined with any additional borrowings available to us, will be sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could cause these risks to intensify. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to repay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our board of directors, or a committee thereof, has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. The ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOther Risks Related to our Business\nFailure of our information systems or those of third parties or breaches of data security could cause significant harm to our business.\nOur systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers, and others. In addition, we rely on information systems controlled by third parties. Information system failures, network disruptions, and system and data security breaches, manipulation, destruction, or leakage, whether intentional or accidental, could impair our ability to provide services to our customers or otherwise harm our ability to conduct our business. Any such failures, disruptions or breaches could also impede the development, manufacture or\nshipment of products, interrupt or delay processing of transactions and reporting financial results, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, or result in the unintentional disclosure of personal, proprietary, sensitive, or confidential information of employees, customers, and others. Our development and use of the Avid MediaCentral Platform, public and private marketplaces, cloud-based offerings, as well as our evolution toward an enterprise subscription model that requires us to host increasing amounts of customer data, increases the risk that our and our customers\u2019 data and financial and proprietary information could be more susceptible to such failures and data breaches. In addition, the need for substantial numbers of our employees to work remotely, such as due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could create additional data security risks.\nInformation system failures or unauthorized access could be caused by our failure to adequately maintain and enhance our systems and networks, external theft or attack, misconduct by our employees, contractors, vendors, or external bad actors, or many other causes such as power failures, earthquakes, fire, or other natural disasters. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers.\nAny information system failures or unauthorized access to our network or systems could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for us. In addition, we could incur substantial remediation costs, including costs associated with repairing our information systems, implementing further data protection measures, engaging third-party experts and consultants, and increased insurance premiums. In addition, significant or repeated reductions in the performance, reliability, security, or availability of our information systems and network infrastructure could significantly harm our brand and reputation and ability to attract and retain existing and potential users, customers, advertisers, and content providers.\nOur international operations expose us to legal, regulatory and other risks.\nWe derive more than half of our revenues from customers outside of the United States, and we rely on foreign contractors for the supply and manufacture of many of our products. Sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 60%, 63% and 64% of our total net revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We also conduct significant research and development activities overseas, including through third-party development vendors. For example, a portion of our research and development is outsourced to contractors operating in Kiev, Ukraine, we have customer support activities in the Philippines, and we have operations in Poland and Israel.\nOur international operations expose us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022the financial and administrative burdens associated with environmental, tax, labor and employment, and export laws, as well as other business regulations, in foreign jurisdictions, including high compliance costs, inconsistencies among jurisdictions, and a lack of administrative or judicial interpretative guidance;\n\u2022reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022regional economic downturns;\n\u2022economic, social, and political instability, security concerns, and the risk of war;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022longer collection cycles for accounts receivable;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing contracts;\n\u2022difficulties in managing and staffing international implementations and operations, and executing our business strategy internationally;\n\u2022difficulties managing a global labor force;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added or other tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022difficulties in maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls;\n\u2022costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages; and\n\u2022foreign exchange controls that may prevent or limit our ability to repatriate income earned in foreign markets.\nAdditionally, recent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in the European Union, or EU, in 2018, applies to any of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users. The GDPR created a range of new data privacy related compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business practices, and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance, including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements.\nWe may not be successful in developing, implementing, or maintaining policies and strategies that will be effective in managing the varying risks in each country where we do business. Our failure to manage these risks successfully, including developing appropriate contingency plans for our outsourced research and development work, could harm our international operations, reduce our international sales, and increase our costs, thus adversely affecting our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may result in short-term currency exchange losses and could adversely affect our revenues from foreign markets and our manufacturing costs in the long term.\nOur international sales are largely transacted through foreign subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end-user customers. Consequently, we are exposed to short-term currency exchange risks that may adversely affect our revenues, operating results, and cash flows. The majority of our international sales are transacted in euros. To hedge against the dollar/euro exchange exposure of the resulting forecasted payables, receivables and cash balances, we may enter into foreign currency contracts. The success of our hedging programs depends on the accuracy of our forecasts of transaction activity in foreign currency. To the extent that these forecasts are over- or understated during periods of currency volatility, we may experience currency gains or losses. Our hedging activities, if enacted, may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in dollar/euro exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nFurthermore, the significance to our business of sales in Europe subjects us to risks associated with long-term changes in the dollar/euro exchange rate. A sustained strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro would decrease our expected future U.S. dollar revenues from European sales, and could have a significant adverse effect on our overall profit margins. Continuing uncertainty regarding economic conditions, including the solvency of these countries and the stability of the Eurozone, could lead to significant long-term economic weakness and reduced economic growth in Europe, the occurrence of which, or the potential occurrence of which, could lead to a sustained strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, adversely affecting the profitability of our European operations.\nIn addition, we source and manufacture many of our products in China and our costs may increase should the renminbi not remain stable with the U.S. dollar. Although the renminbi is pegged against a basket of currencies determined by the People\u2019s Bank of China, the renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the long term. In addition, if China were to permit the renminbi to float to a free market rate of exchange, it is widely anticipated that the renminbi would appreciate significantly in value against U.S. dollar. An increase in the value of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have the effect of increasing the labor and production costs of our Chinese manufacturers in U.S. dollar terms, which may result in their passing such costs to us in the form of increased pricing, which would adversely affect our profit margins if we could not pass those price increases along to our customers.\nGlobal economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and expenses.\nOur business is impacted by global economic conditions, which have been in recent years, and continue to be, volatile. Specifically, our revenues and gross margins depend significantly on global economic conditions and the demand for our products and services in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates, and difficulty managing inventory levels. Sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services and could cause demand to differ materially from our expectations as customers curtail or delay spending on our products and services. Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenues, gross margins and expenses.\nOur international operations increase the risk that we could violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.\nWe operate in several foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such official in his or her official capacity, inducing the official to do any act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals.\nWe operate in a number of countries that are recognized as having governmental corruption problems to some degree and where local customs and practices may not foster strict compliance with anti-corruption laws, including China. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Although we have policies that mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws and require training, we cannot assure you that these policies and procedures will protect us from unauthorized reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violations of these laws may result in significant criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe rely to a significant extent on manufacturing and hardware development vendors with operations in foreign jurisdictions. This may reduce our control over the manufacturing activities, create uncertainty with respect to intended cost savings and expose our proprietary assets to greater risk of misappropriation. Changes to these vendor relationships may result in delays or disruptions that could harm our business.\nWe rely to a significant extent on vendors for the development and manufacture of certain of our hardware products, primarily in Mexico. These relationships provide us with more flexible resource capabilities, access to global talent, and cost savings, but also expose us to risks that may not exist or may be less pronounced with respect to our internal operations. We are able to exercise only limited oversight of our contractors, including with respect to their engineering and manufacturing processes, resource allocations, delivery schedules, security procedures, and quality control. Language and cultural, and time zone differences complicate effective management of contractors that are located abroad. Additionally, competition for talent in certain locations may lead to high turnover rates that disrupt development or manufacturing continuity. The manufacturers we use also manufacture products for other companies, including our competitors. Our contractors could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, increase the prices they charge us or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Pricing terms offered by contractors may be highly variable over time reflecting, among other things, order volume, local inflation, and exchange rates. Some of our contractor relationships are based on contract, while others operate on a purchase order basis, where we do not have the benefit of written protections with respect to pricing or other critical terms.\nMany of our contractors require access to our intellectual property and our confidential and proprietary information to perform their services. Protection of these assets in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions may be less robust than in the United States. We must rely on policies and procedures we have instituted with our contractors and certain confidentiality and contractual provisions in our written agreements, to the extent they exist, for protection. These safeguards may be inadequate to prevent breaches. If a breach were to occur, available legal or other remedies may be limited or otherwise insufficient to compensate us for any resulting damages.\nFurthermore, if one of our international vendors were, for any reason, to cease or experience significant disruptions in its operations, among others as a result of political unrest, we might be unable to replace it on a timely basis with a comparably priced provider. We would also have to expend time and resources to train any new development or manufacturing vendor. If any of the vendors were to suffer an interruption in its business, or experience delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in development or manufacturing operations, or if we had to change development or manufacturing vendors, our ability to provide services to our customers would be delayed and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain competent and skilled management and technical, sales, and other personnel.\nWe are dependent on the continued service and performance of our management team and key technical, sales, and other personnel and our success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain these employees in a competitive job market. If we fail to recruit and retain, including through competitive compensation, competent and skilled personnel, we may incur increased costs or experience challenges with the execution of our strategic plan. Also, if we fail to maintain an inclusive and discrimination-free workplace, we risk losing employees.\nOur competitors may in some instances be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities to work with cutting-edge technology than we can. If we are unable to retain our key personnel or appropriately match skill sets with our needs, we would be required to expend significant time and financial resources to identify and hire new qualified personnel and to transfer significant internal historical knowledge, which might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.
