{"cik": "1528930", "company": "Liberty Tax, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-10-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this annual report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRecent turnover in our senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn September 2017, Edward Brunot, our Chief Operating Officer, was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer shortly after the termination of John T. Hewitt. In February 2018, the Board of Directors appointed Nicole Ossenfort as President and Chief Executive Officer to replace Mr. Brunot. In addition, several members of our senior management team have resigned since September 2017, including two chief financial officers, general counsel, chief information officer and other positions. Since that time, the Company made several significant hires, including the rehiring of Michael S. Piper as Chief Financial Officer; however, this turnover in senior management could cause operational disruptions and create uncertainty for management, employees, franchisees, customers and stockholders.\nSenior management turnover may also disrupt our operations, our strategic focus or our ability to drive stockholder value. In addition, these changes and the failure to retain and recruit key employees, including senior management, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to manage day-to-day aspects of our business, as well as our ability to continue to grow our business. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain senior management personnel having the experience and skills necessary to assist us. We face competition for personnel from numerous other entities, including competing tax return preparation firms, some of which have significantly greater resources than us. We can provide no assurances that turnover in senior management will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRecent turnover with our Board of Directors may disrupt our operations, our strategic focus or our ability to drive stockholder value.\nIn addition to changes to our senior management, there also have been significant changes to our Board of Directors since September 2017, as reported in our periodic filings. In May 2018, four Class A directors - G. William Minner, Jr., Thomas Herskovits, Patrick A. Cozza and Lawrence Miller - were elected by our Class A stockholders to the Board of Directors. As a result of these changes, the Board of Directors appointed new independent members to its Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee to remain in compliance with our bylaws and Nasdaq listing standards.\nAdditionally, in connection with the sale of his Class A and Class B common stock to unaffiliated third parties, Mr. Hewitt agreed to tender his resignation to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and agreed to cause the five Class B directors previously appointed by Mr. Hewitt to tender their resignations, in each case, effective upon the closing of the sale. On August 9, 2018, the Company received a written consent executed by a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock electing the following five persons as directors of the Company to serve until the Company\u2019s next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified: Brian R. Kahn, Andrew M. Laurence, Matthew Avril, Bryant R. Riley and Kenneth M. Young.\nTurnover with our Board of Directors may disrupt our operations, our strategic focus or our ability to drive stockholder value. If we fail to attract and retain new skilled personnel for our Board of Directors and senior management positions, our business and growth prospects could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.\nBecause much of our growth has been achieved through rapidly opening new offices, we may not achieve the same level of growth in revenues and profits in future years.\nHistorically our growth has been driven by selling franchises and entering into agreements with ADs who have assisted us in expanding our geographic reach. However, our success depends, in part, on retaining operational offices which contribute to our growth. Slowed growth in expanding office count and closures of company-owned and franchisee operations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated financial position, results of operation and cash flows.\nOur future viability, profitability, and growth will depend upon our ability to successfully operate and continue to expand our operations in the United States and Canada. Furthermore, in prior years, our business has experienced rapid growth in the number of franchisees and office locations in large geographic markets, and our continued growth in those markets may not continue at the same pace. Our ability to continue to grow our business will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and will depend in large part on:\n\u2022\nadding new customers and retaining existing customers;\n\u2022\ninnovating new products and services to meet the needs of our customers;\n\u2022\nfinding new opportunities in our existing and new markets;\n\u2022\nremaining competitive in the tax return preparation industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer directly and to facilitate through others the sale of tax settlement products;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining capable franchisees and ADs;\n\u2022\nmaintaining a reputation for quality tax preparation services sufficient to attract and retain customers and franchisees;\n\u2022\nour success in replacing independent preparers with franchisees;\n\u2022\nhiring, training, and retaining skilled managers and seasonal employees; and\n\u2022\nexpanding and improving the efficiency of our operations and systems.\nThere can be no assurance that any of our efforts will prove successful or that we will continue to achieve growth in revenues and profits.\nThe highly seasonal nature of our business presents a number of financial risks and operational challenges which, if we fail to meet, could materially affect our business.\nOur business is highly seasonal, with the substantial portion of our revenue earned in the January through April \u201ctax season\u201d in the United States and Canada each year. The concentration of our revenue-generating activity during this relatively short period presents a number of challenges for us and our franchisees, including:\n\u2022\ncash and resource management during the first eight months of our fiscal year, when we generally operate at a loss and incur fixed costs and costs of preparing for the upcoming tax season;\n\u2022\ncompliance with financial covenants under our credit facility, particularly if the timing of our revenue generation deviates from our typical revenue patterns;\n\u2022\nthe availability of seasonal employees willing to work for our franchisees for at or near the minimum wage, with minimal benefits, for periods of less than a year;\n\u2022\nthe success of our franchisees in hiring, training, and supervising these employees and dealing with turnover rates;\n\u2022\naccurate forecasting of revenues and expenses because we may have little or no time to respond to changes in competitive conditions, markets, pricing, and new product offerings by competitors, which could affect our position during the tax season;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in one tax season, including any customer dissatisfaction issues, which may not be discovered until the following tax season; and\n\u2022\nensuring optimal uninterrupted operations during peak season.\nIf we experience significant business disruptions during the tax season or if we or our franchisees are unable to meet the challenges described above, we could experience a loss of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend in part upon the continued success of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain capable middle management.\nFailure to maintain the continued services of senior management personnel or to attract and maintain capable middle management could have a material adverse effect on us. If senior management were to leave the Company, it could be difficult\nto replace them, and our operations and ability to manage day to day aspects of our business as well as our ability to continue to grow our business may be materially adversely affected. Our future success will also depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain capable middle management, such as regional directors, consultants for franchised offices, training directors, tax advisors, and computer personnel, having the specific executive skills necessary to assist us and our franchisees. We face competition for personnel from numerous other entities, including competing tax return preparation firms, some of which have significantly greater resources than we do.\nBecause we are not a financial institution, we can only facilitate the sale of financial products through our arrangements with financial institutions and other financial partners and, if these arrangements are terminated for any reason, we may not be able to replace them on acceptable terms or at all.\nRevenue derived from our facilitation of the sale of financial products provided to our customers by financial institutions and providers is approximately 25% to 30% of our total annual revenue. Our tax return preparation business is also, to some extent, dependent on our ability to facilitate the sale of these products, because our customers are often attracted to our business by the expectation that these products will be available. Financial products that monetize future tax refunds are specialized financial products, and if our arrangements with the financial institutions and other partners that provide our tax settlement products were to terminate and we were unable to secure an alternative relationship on acceptable terms, or at all, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any changes in our contractual terms with these financial institutions and other partners that result in a reduction in our fee income, if not offset by customer growth associated with lower fees, could adversely affect our profitability. See \u201c-Risks Related to Regulation of Our Industry-We may be unsuccessful in litigation that characterizes refund transfer products as loans, which could subject us to damages and additional regulation, and which could adversely affect our ability to offer tax settlement products and have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\u201d\nWe face significant competition in the tax return preparation business and face a competitive threat from software providers and internet businesses that enable and encourage taxpayers to prepare their own tax returns.\nThe tax return preparation industry is characterized by intense competition. We compete with H&R Block, which is larger and more widely recognized than we are, Jackson Hewitt and with other national and regional tax services and smaller independent tax return preparation services, small franchisors, regional tax return preparation businesses, accounting firms, and financial service institutions that prepare tax returns as part of their business. Additionally, we believe that many taxpayers in our target market prepare their own returns and in light of recent tax legislation enacted by the US government and any proposed modifications to the Internal Revenue Code which simplify tax preparation, may result in even more taxpayers preparing their own returns. The availability of these alternative options may reduce demand for our products and limit the fees our franchisees can charge, and competitors may develop or offer more attractive or lower cost products and services than ours, which could erode our consumer base.\nWe also face increased competitive challenges from the online and software self-preparer market, including the FFA, a consortium of the IRS, online preparation services that provides free online tax return preparation, and assistance from volunteer organizations that prepare tax returns at no cost for low-income taxpayers. In addition, many of our direct competitors offer certain free online tax preparation and electronic filing options, and limited in-office promotions of free or nominal cost tax preparation services. Government tax authorities, volunteer organizations, and direct competitors may elect to expand free and reduced cost offerings in the future. Intense price competition, including offers of free service, could result in a loss of market share, lower revenues, or lower margins. Our ability to compete in the tax return preparation business depends on our product offerings, price for services, customer service, the specific site locations of our offices, local economic conditions, quality of on-site office management, the ability to file tax returns electronically with the IRS, and the availability of tax settlement products to our customers.\nWe rely on our own proprietary tax preparation software, and any difficulties in deploying or utilizing our software each tax season could adversely affect our business.\nWe utilize our own tax preparation software. However, tax changes made by the federal and state governments each year and changes in tax forms require us to make substantial changes to our software before the beginning of each tax season. See \u201c-Risks Related to Changes in Tax Laws and Regulations-New or revised tax regulations could have a material effect on our financial results.\u201d Although we engage in extensive testing of our software before deploying it in our franchisees' tax preparation offices and online, any delays in the availability of IRS forms or instructions or problems with the rollout of the new software each season could delay the ability to file tax returns at the beginning of the tax season and could adversely affect our business.\nOur Company-owned offices may not be as successful as our franchised offices.\nHistorically, almost all Liberty Tax offices have been owned by franchisees, and most of the Company-owned offices we have operated during a tax season have been offices previously operated by former franchisees. Our Company-owned offices may be less successful than our typical franchisee-owned offices because they often represent offices transitioned from a less successful franchisee. For this reason, we are not able to obtain the continuity of staffing in Company-owned offices that we expect to experience in our franchisee-owned offices. As part of our business strategy, we may also take back offices previously operated by franchisees who have elected to exit the system and these offices may face operational and financial challenges which could negatively impact the success of the offices. However, our failure to timely comply with our periodic reporting requirements has resulted in the delisting of our Class A common stock, which has affected our ability to sell franchises in our fiscal year ending April 30, 2019.\nThe provision of health insurance and other insurance products to customers by our franchisees and their preparers may subject us and our franchisees to additional claims from customers, as well as increased regulatory risk.\nAs part of our effort to make information about health insurance options available to tax office customers, we have encouraged our franchisees to make licensed insurance agents available in tax offices. A significant number of our franchisees have become or arranged for the availability of insurance agents and participated in the writing of health insurance policies for customers. The provision of these insurance services subjects our franchisees to a complex regulatory environment, and to potential claims by customers who may become dissatisfied with the insurance products they obtain. Any failure by our franchisees or their employees to comply with applicable insurance laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and subject our franchisees and us to regulatory complaints, and any failure by our franchisees to provide satisfactory insurance services to customers may adversely affect our customer relationships and our business.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nWe regard our intellectual property as critical to the success of our business. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. The actions we take to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. There are no assurances that we will be able to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information. Any infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights. In addition, third parties may assert infringement claims against us. Any claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages. An adverse determination in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third party's patent or to license alternative technology from another party. Litigation is time-consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources. Any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims.\nOur business relies on technology systems and electronic communications, which, if disrupted, could materially affect our business.\nOur ability to file tax returns electronically and to facilitate tax settlement products depends on our ability to electronically communicate with all of our offices, the IRS, state tax agencies, and the financial institutions that provide the tax settlement products. Our electronic communications network is subject to disruptions of various magnitudes and durations, such as a data breach or server disruption. Any data breach or severe disruption of our network or electronic communications, especially during the tax season, could impair our ability to complete our customers' tax filings, to provide tax settlement products from financial institutions, or to maintain our operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, in the course of our business, we collect, use, and retain large amounts of our clients\u2019 personal information, including tax return information and social security numbers. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure, products and services remain secure and are perceived by customers, clients and partners to be secure. See \u201c-If we fail to protect or fail to comply with laws and regulations related to our customers' personal information, we may face significant fines, penalties, or damages and our brand and reputation may be harmed.\u201d\nWe are dependent on our financing sources and any loss of financing could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our ability to expand our business.\nWe are dependent upon the continued availability of our credit facility, which consists of a term loan and a revolving loan, in order to fund our seasonal needs and for the further expansion of our business. If we were to default on our financing or otherwise lose access to our sources of credit, our ability to provide financing to our franchisees would be significantly impaired and may result in certain offices closing if our franchisees are not able to secure alternative financing for their working capital needs. In addition, our ability to expand our business would be impaired. We may need to obtain new credit arrangements and other sources of financing to continue to provide financing to our franchisees, to meet future obligations, and to fund our future growth. Our ability to maintain or refinance our debt and fund other obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance and the availability of funds from credit markets. There is no assurance that when our credit facility matures in 2019, we will be able to renew or refinance our debt or enter into new credit arrangements on terms similar to those of our existing loans.\nOur credit facility contains restrictive covenants and other requirements that may limit our business flexibility by imposing operating and financial restrictions on our operations.\nOur credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including the assets of our subsidiaries. We are subject to a number of covenants that could potentially restrict how we carry out our business or that require us to meet certain periodic tests in the form of financial covenants. The restrictions we consider to be material to our ongoing business include the following:\n\u2022\nWe must satisfy a \u201cleverage ratio\u201d test that is based on our outstanding indebtedness at the end of each fiscal quarter.\n\u2022\nWe must satisfy a \u201cfixed charge coverage ratio\u201d test at the end of each fiscal quarter.\n\u2022\nWe must reduce the outstanding balance under our revolving loan to zero for a period of at least 45 consecutive days each fiscal year.\n\u2022\nWe must also maintain a minimum net worth requirement, measured at April 30 of each year.\nOur credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness; limitations on liens and negative pledges; delivery of financial statements and other information requirements; limitations on investments, loans, and acquisitions; limitations on mergers, consolidations, liquidations, and dissolutions; limitations on sales of assets; limitations on certain restricted payments; and limitations on transactions with affiliates; among others.\nA breach of any of these covenants, tests, or mandatory payments could limit our ability to borrow funds under the revolving loan or result in a default under our loans. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from incurring additional indebtedness to expand our operations and execute our business strategy, including making acquisitions. We may also from time to time seek to refinance all or a portion of our debt or incur additional debt in the future. Any such future debt or other contracts could contain covenants more restrictive than those in our existing credit facility. Our ability to comply with the covenants, tests, or mandatory payments in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions or our ability to make tax settlement products available to our customers. See \u201cItem 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Overview of factors affecting our liquidity-Credit facility.\u201d\nWe are dependent on the timing of the tax filing season, and disruptions in the opening of the tax season may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity.\nHistorically, the federal tax filing season has begun in mid-January, and both we and our franchisees have begun to prepare tax returns in early January with the ability to electronically file those returns beginning in mid-January. For both the 2013 and 2014 tax seasons, the IRS postponed the first date on which it generally accepts electronic filings until the end of January, and in 2013, also delayed the availability of a significant number of tax forms. These delays at the beginning of the tax season were also replicated at the state level in 2013, because of the reliance of states on tax forms that are dependent upon or subject to changes in federal tax forms. The change in the start of the 2013 and 2014 tax filing seasons materially affected our revenue during the fiscal quarter ended January 31 of both years, and also required us to engage in additional borrowing to support both our operations and those of our franchisees because of the delay in receipt of revenue associated with tax filings. Similarly, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the \u201cPATH Act\u201d), enacted in 2015 came into effect in 2017, in which the IRS was required to wait until at least February 15, 2017 to issue refunds to taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit. In addition, due to tax reform and the IRS\u2019 modification of forms such as the 1040 and attached schedules, there is the possibility that the IRS\u2019 acceptance of tax returns may face, as of now undetermined,\ndelays. Substantial delays in the opening of the tax filing season or the funding of processed returns, in future years would likely have an adverse effect on our revenue and liquidity.\nOur floating rate debt financing exposes us to interest rate risk.\nWe may borrow amounts under our credit facility that bear interest at rates that vary with prevailing market interest rates. Accordingly, if we do not adequately hedge our interest rate risk, a rise in market interest rates will adversely affect our financial results. We expect to draw most heavily on our revolving loan from July through January of each year and then repay substantially all of the borrowings by the end of each tax season. Therefore, a significant rise in interest rates during our off-season could have a disproportionate impact on our financial results during these months.\nThe lines of business in which we operate involve substantial litigation, and such litigation may damage our reputation or result in material liabilities and losses.\nWe have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation arising in connection with our various business activities. We are currently involved in a class action lawsuit, in which we are vigorously defending ourselves. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not have to pay significant damages or amounts in settlement above insurance coverage. Adverse outcomes related to litigation could result in substantial damages and could cause our net income to decline or may require us to alter our business operations. Negative public opinion can also result from our actual or alleged conduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation, which could negatively impact our financial performance and could cause the value of our stock to decline. See \"Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we fail to protect or fail to comply with laws and regulations related to our customers' personal information, we may face significant fines, penalties, or damages and our brand and reputation may be harmed.\nPrivacy concerns relating to the disclosure of consumer financial information have drawn increased attention from federal and state governments in the United States. The IRS generally prohibits the use or disclosure by tax return preparers of taxpayers' information without the prior written consent of the taxpayer. In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) regulations require financial service providers, including tax return preparers, to adopt and disclose consumer privacy policies and provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to opt out of having personal information disclosed to unaffiliated third parties for advertising purposes. We and our franchisees manage highly sensitive client information in our operations, and although we have established security procedures to protect against identity theft and require our franchisees to do the same, a security incident resulting in breaches of our customers' privacy may occur. If the measures we have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate or if our franchisees fail to meet their obligations in this area, we and our franchisees may become subject to litigation or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines, penalties, or damages and harm to our brand and reputation, which in turn could negatively impact our ability to retain our customers. Moreover, although we have some insurance that may defray the cost, the cost of remediating any breach resulting from a cybersecurity incident or other breach of the privacy of customer information would likely be substantial. Furthermore, we may be required to invest additional resources to protect us against damages caused by these actual or perceived disruptions or security breaches in the future. We could also suffer harm to our reputation from a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of customer information. Changes in these federal and state regulatory requirements could result in more stringent requirements and could result in a need to change business practices, including how information is disclosed. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, a significant security breach or disclosure of customer information could so damage our brand and reputation that demand for the services that are provided by us and our franchisees may be reduced.\nIf our business or the tax industry generally is perceived as a source of identity theft, our reputation may be harmed, and our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nIdentity theft and privacy concerns relating to customer information disclosure has been the subject of attention in recent years, including the substantial publicity around identity theft problems involving at least one of our competitors. Further, in May 2015, the IRS announced a significant breach of its data security that resulted in the potential theft of personally identifiable tax information involving more than 100,000 taxpayers. If the use of electronic tax filing becomes perceived by customers as subjecting them to unacceptable identity theft risk, or if we experience a breach of security that subjects a number of our customers to potential identity theft, customers may eschew our services or assisted tax preparation generally, in favor of self-preparation and the avoidance of electronic filing. In such an event, our reputation may be harmed, and we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIf we or our franchisees fail to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, we may face significant damages.\nThe retention of customers by our franchisees, and our ability to attract additional franchisees, depends on the use of telephone calls and text messaging to contact customers and potential franchisees. However, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d) imposes significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. In fiscal 2015, we settled one lawsuit related to the manner in which a contractor for us previously contacted potential franchisees. Violations of the TCPA may be enforced by individual customers through class actions, and statutory penalties for TCPA violations range from $500 to $1,500 per violation. If we fail to ensure that our own telemarketing and telemarketing efforts are TCPA compliant, or if our franchisees fail to do so and we are held responsible for their behavior, we may incur significant damages.\nIf we and our franchisees are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nBoth we and our franchisees depend on the ability to hire a substantial number of seasonal employees for each tax season. We require seasonal employees in order to staff our franchises and customer call centers and Company-owned offices, and our franchisees require employees to implement marketing programs, to act as tax preparers, and to otherwise staff their offices. The ability of our franchisees and us to meet our labor needs is subject to many external factors, including competition for qualified personnel, unemployment levels in each of the markets in which we have offices, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, and workplace regulation. Our franchisees require a substantial number of employees who are willing to become trained as tax preparers, and who have the ability to engage in temporary, seasonal employment. Moreover, in addition to our seasonal employees, we hire a substantial number of full-time employees who are required to have the technical skills necessary to participate in software development, database management, and other highly technical tasks. If we and our franchisees are not able to hire a sufficient supply of qualified seasonal employees, or if we are not able to secure employees with the technical skills we require for other purposes, our ability to serve our customers in our offices, to deploy our marketing programs, and to maintain the services that our franchisees require may be compromised and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur financial success depends in significant part on our ability to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees. The support of our franchisees is also critical for the success of our marketing programs and any new strategic initiatives we seek to undertake. Deterioration in our relationships with our franchisees or the failure of our franchisees to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAn increase in the minimum wage may adversely affect the operations of our franchisees.\nMany of the seasonal employees hired by our franchisees for each tax season receive compensation at or near the minimum wage. If our franchisees experience increases in payroll expenses as a result of government-mandated increases in the minimum wage or overtime requirements, their costs of operation may increase at a rate greater than their ability to raise the prices of the services they offer. If this occurs, our franchisees may not be able to maintain seasonal employment at levels that will provide an optimal level of customer service and marketing support, their marketing and advertising programs may be less effective, and their results of operations may be adversely affected, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf credit market volatility affects our financial partners or franchisees, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIn recent years, the credit markets experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption, causing many lenders and institutional investors to cease providing funding to even the most creditworthy borrowers or to other financial institutions. If additional credit market volatility prevents our financial partners from providing tax settlement products to our customers, limits the products offered, or results in us having to incur further financial obligations to support our financial partners, our revenues or profitability could decline. The cost and availability of funds has also adversely impacted our franchisees' ability to grow and operate their businesses, which could cause our revenues or profitability to decline. In addition, future disruptions in\nthe credit markets could adversely affect our ability to sell territories to new or existing franchisees, causing our revenues or profitability to decline.\nBecause the tax season is relatively short and straddles two quarters, our quarterly results may not be indicative of our performance.\nWe experience quarterly variations in revenues and operating income as a result of many factors, including the highly seasonal nature of the tax return preparation business, the timing of off-season activities, and the hiring of personnel. Due to the foregoing factors, our quarter-to-quarter results vary significantly. In addition, because our peak period straddles the third and fourth quarters, any delay or acceleration in the number of tax returns processed in January may make our year-to-year quarterly comparisons not as meaningful as year-to-year tax season comparisons. To the extent our quarterly results vary significantly from year to year, our stock value may be subject to significant volatility.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nOur corporate actions could be substantially influenced by our principal stockholders and affiliated entities.\nAs of August 10, 2018, our principal stockholders and their affiliated entities owned over 50% of our outstanding Class A common stock. These stockholders, acting individually or as a group, could exert substantial influence over matters, such as electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions. In addition, because of the percentage of ownership and voting concentration in these principal stockholders and their affiliated entities, elections of our Board of Directors will generally be within the control of these stockholders and their affiliated entities. While all of our stockholders are entitled to vote on matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, the concentration of shares and voting control presently lies with these principal stockholders and their affiliated entities. As such, it would be difficult for stockholders to propose and have approved proposals not supported by management. There can be no assurance that matters voted upon by our principal stockholders and their affiliated entities will be viewed favorably by all stockholders of the Company. For information regarding the ownership of our outstanding stock, please see the section titled \u201cItem 12 - Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.\u201d\nOur Class A common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Market, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nEffective at the open of business on August 2, 2018, our Class A common stock was suspended from trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Since then, our Class A common stock has been quoted on the OTC Market. The OTC Market is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. We have appealed the delisting determination of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel and requested to maintain the listing of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock on Nasdaq. However, we cannot assure you that the appeal will be granted, that we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of any stock exchange, or that we will be able to maintain any such listing.\nOur stock price has been extremely volatile, and investors may be unable to resell their shares at or above their acquisition price or at all.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results from our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nsales of Class A common stock or other securities by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\ncertain non-compliance, fraud and other misconduct by our franchisees and/or employees;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key executives or directors;\n\u2022\nresignation of our auditors;\n\u2022\ndelisting determination by Nasdaq;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, financing efforts or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ndelays or other changes in our expansion plans;\n\u2022\ninvolvement in litigation or governmental investigations or enforcement activity;\n\u2022\nstock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and stock market conditions;\n\u2022\nregulatory or political developments; and\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks or natural disasters.\nFurthermore, the capital markets experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations may negatively impact our stock price. Trading price fluctuations may also make it more difficult for us to use our Class A common stock as a means to make acquisitions or to use options to purchase our Class A common stock to attract and retain employees. If our stock price does not exceed the price at which stockholders acquired their shares, investors may not realize any return on their investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We currently are, and may be in the future, the target of this type of litigation. See \u201c-We are named in federal securities class action lawsuits and derivative complaints; if we are unable to resolve these matters favorably, then our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\u201d\nA significant portion of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock may be sold into the market, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nAlthough our Class A common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Market, sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market could occur at any time, subject to certain securities law restrictions. Sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of Class A common stock intend to sell shares could reduce our stock price.\nOur stock price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish misleading or unfavorable research or reports about our business.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. The number of securities or industry analysts that commence or maintain coverage of our Class A common stock could adversely impact the trading price and liquidity for our shares. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAs a public company, we are subject to reporting and other compliance requirements, which may result in increased costs and focus of our management's attention.\nAs a company with public equity, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), as well as related rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, impose various requirements on companies with public equity. As a public company, we are required to:\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports and other stockholder communications in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and Nasdaq rules,\n\u2022\ncreate or expand the roles and duties of our Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors,\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance functions,\n\u2022\nsupplement our internal accounting and auditing function,\n\u2022\nenhance and formalize closing procedures at the end of our accounting periods,\n\u2022\nenhance our investor relations function,\n\u2022\nestablish new or enhanced internal policies, including those relating to disclosure controls and procedures, and\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above.\nOur management and other personnel have devoted a substantial amount of time to these compliance matters. Also, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly than would be the case for a private company. For example, these rules and regulations have made it more expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors or as our executive officers. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business-Recent turnover in our senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business.\u201d and \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business-Recent turnover with our Board of Directors may disrupt our operations, our strategic focus or our ability to drive stockholder value.\u201d\nIn addition, as a public company, we are subject to financial reporting, internal controls over financial reporting and other requirements, including Nasdaq continued listing requirements. Our failure to timely comply with these periodic reporting requirements has resulted in the delisting of our Class A common stock, which could adversely affect investor confidence in our Company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. A failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial statements which may have an unfavorable impact on the value of our common stock. In addition, our failure to timely comply with reporting requirements has resulted our inability to complete franchise sales and to provide current financial information to our investors. See \u201c-Our Class A common stock is quoted on the OTC Market, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\u201d\nWe are named in federal securities class action lawsuits and derivative complaints; if we are unable to resolve these matters favorably, then our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe are currently involved in securities and derivative litigation in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia. See \"Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot at this time predict the outcome of these matters or reasonably determine the probability of a material adverse result or reasonably estimate range of potential exposure, if any, that these matters might have on us, our business, our financial condition or our results of operations, although such effects could be materially adverse. In addition, in the future, we may need to record litigation reserves with respect to these matters. Further, regardless of how these matters proceed, it could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources away from our business.\nWe will no longer be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we may no longer take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements.\nConcurrent with the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2018, we will no longer be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d) enacted in April 2012, and we will not be able to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are emerging growth companies. As such, we will be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Further, we will not be able to take advantage of the same reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements that smaller reporting companies are permitted to provide or exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation, frequency of approval of executive compensation, and of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, we will no longer be able to take advantage of Section 107 of the JOBS Act that provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and the Exchange Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nAlthough we may desire to continue to pay dividends in the future, our financial condition, debt covenants, or Delaware law may prohibit us from doing so.\nWe began declaring and paying cash dividends on our common stock in April 2015. Although we have announced a $0.16 per share quarterly cash dividend and may continue to pay cash dividends in the future, the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, on our earnings, capital requirements, and financial condition. Our ability to pay dividends will also be subject to compliance with financial covenants that are contained in our credit facility and may be restricted by any future indebtedness that we incur or issuances of preferred stock. In addition, applicable law requires our Board of Directors to determine that we have adequate surplus prior to the declaration of dividends. We cannot provide an assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at any specific level or at all.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, Delaware law, and our credit facility could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, and adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws also include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to approximately 3.0 million shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, the Chair of our Board of Directors, or holders of at least 20% of the shares that will be entitled to vote on the matters presented at such special meeting;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors.\nIn addition, our credit facility contains covenants that may impede, discourage, or prevent a takeover of us. For instance, upon a change of control, we would default on our credit facility. As a result, a potential takeover may not occur unless sufficient funds are available to repay our outstanding debt.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws or our debt documents that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect our stock value if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Franchise Business\nOur success is tied to the growth and operations of our franchises, and their operations could adversely affect our business.\nOur financial success depends on our franchisees and the manner in which they operate and develop their offices. We do not exercise direct control over the day-to-day operations of our franchises, and our franchisees may not operate their offices in a manner consistent with our philosophy and standards and may not increase the level of revenues generated compared to prior tax seasons. Our growth and revenues may, therefore, be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that the training programs and quality control procedures we have established will be effective in enabling franchisees to run profitable tax preparation businesses or that we will be able to identify problems or take corrective action quickly enough. In addition, failure by a franchisee to provide service at acceptable levels may result in adverse publicity that can materially adversely affect our reputation and ability to compete in the market in which the franchisee is located. Further, franchisees are required to prepare tax returns solely through the use of our authorized software. Franchisees\u2019 failure to use the authorized software or conversely, the use of alternative software, prevents us from monitoring tax returns prepared by a franchisee for accuracy and may also prevent us from the opportunity to collect revenue such as royalties.\nIf our franchisees fail to open offices in new territories or if they are not successful in operating their new offices, our franchise-related revenue and results of operation will be adversely affected.\nEach year, we anticipate adding offices to our franchise system, but the opening of these offices depends on the purchase of additional territories by our franchisees and on the opening of offices in territories previously purchased and newly purchased. Many factors go into opening a new office, including obtaining a suitable office location, the availability of sufficient start-up capital, and the ability to recruit tax preparers and other personnel to work in new offices. If a significant number of offices that we expect to be open in a tax season fail to open, are delayed, or open in unsuitable locations or with insufficient personnel, the revenue we expect to receive from royalty payments and the repayment of indebtedness to us by our franchisees will be adversely affected. Because we utilize an almost exclusive franchise business model, we do not have the same flexibility to open new offices as our competitors who make greater use of Company-owned offices. Additionally, our failure to timely comply with our periodic reporting requirements has resulted in the delisting of our Class A common stock, which has affected our ability to sell franchises in our fiscal year ended April 30, 2019.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by the default of our franchisees and ADs on loans made by us or third parties.\nWe extend financing to certain franchisees for initial franchise fees as cash advances for their working capital needs and for other purposes. The financing is in the form of promissory notes payable to us. There can be no assurance that any franchisee will generate revenue sufficient to repay any amounts due nor is there any assurance that any franchisee will be able to repay any amounts due through other means. We also extend financing to ADs from time-to-time for a portion of their area development fees. Any failure by the franchisees and ADs to pay these amounts, if the amounts are not recoverable by us through other means, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nMoreover, in some cases, we may be liable for office leases or other contractual obligations that have been assumed by purchasers of Company-owned offices and acquired tax practices. If the franchisees default on third-party obligations for which we continue to have liability, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe may be held responsible by third parties, regulators, or courts for the action of, or failure to act, by our franchisees and be exposed to possible fines, other liabilities, and bad publicity.\nWe grant our franchisees a limited license to use our registered service marks and, accordingly, there is risk that one or more of the franchisees may be identified as being controlled by us. Third parties, regulators, or courts may seek to hold us responsible for the actions or failures to act by our franchisees. The extent to which franchisors should be held responsible for the behavior of their franchisees has become a more significant issue in recent years, with some government agencies taking the position that the extent to which a franchise system establishes requirements for franchisees may justify treating the franchisor as if it \u201ccontrols\u201d the franchisee\u2019s behavior. Thus, the failure of our franchisees to comply with laws and regulations may expose us to liability and damages that may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe Liberty Tax brand could be impaired due to actions taken by our franchisees, their employees or otherwise.\nWe believe the Liberty Tax brand is one of our most valuable assets in that it provides us with a competitive advantage, particularly over our competitors that do not have a national presence. Our franchisees operate their businesses under our brand. Because our franchisees are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them, including breaches of their contractual obligations, and negative publicity associated with these actions, could adversely affect our reputation and brand more broadly. Any actions as a result of conduct by our franchisees, their employees or otherwise which negatively impacts our reputation and brand may result in fewer customers and lower revenues and profits for us.\nOur tax return preparation compliance program may not be successful in detecting all problems in our franchisee network, and franchisee non-compliance, fraud and other misconduct and related enforcement action may damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nAlthough our tax return preparation compliance program seeks to monitor the activities of our franchisees, it is unlikely to detect every problem. While we have implemented a variety of measures to enhance tax return preparation compliance as well as our monitoring of these activities, there can be no assurance that franchisees and tax preparers will follow these procedures. From time to time, the federal and/or state authorities may take adverse action against franchisees or preparers related to tax compliance issues, seeking injunctions, damages or even criminal sanctions with respect to such behavior. Failure to detect and prevent tax return preparation compliance issues could expose us to the risk of government investigation or litigation, result in bad publicity and reputational harm, and could subject us to remedies and loss of customers that could cause our revenues or profitability to decline. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business-If we fail to protect or fail to comply with laws and regulations related to our customers' personal information, we may face significant fines, penalties, or damages and our brand and reputation may be harmed.\u201d\nIn fiscal 2016, the DOJ announced two lawsuits against certain of our former franchisees and two lawsuits against then-existing franchisees, which concluded in fiscal 2017. Allegations involved claims of fraudulent tax preparation. We were not named as a defendant in these suits. Further, in fiscal 2017, the state of Maryland, Office of the Comptroller suspended the processing of electronic and paper returns of one franchisee and two offices in that state. In fiscal 2018, the DOJ filed suit against one former and two then active franchisees in Florida based upon their alleged preparation of fraudulent tax returns. Also during fiscal 2018, the DOJ indicted four Milwaukee tax preparers based upon their alleged filing of fraudulent tax returns. We are cooperating with the applicable governmental authorities in connection with their investigations. We have continued to enhance our Compliance Department tasked with examining and preventing non-compliance, fraud and other misconduct among our franchisees and their employees. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that our Compliance Department, the tax return preparation compliance program, or other efforts will be effective in eliminating non-compliance, fraud and other misconduct among our franchisees and/or employees. Accordingly, any such non-compliance, fraud or other misconduct may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisputes with our franchisees may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we engage in disputes with some of our franchisees, and some of these disputes result in litigation or arbitration proceedings. Disputes with our franchisees may require us to incur significant legal fees, subject us to damages, and occupy a disproportionate amount of management's time. A material increase in the number of these disputes, or unfavorable outcomes in these disputes, may have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent we have disputes with our franchisees, our relationships with our franchisees could be negatively impacted, which could hurt our growth prospects or negatively impact our financial performance.\nOur operating results depend on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs and franchisee support of these programs.\nOur revenues are heavily influenced by brand marketing and advertising. If our marketing and advertising programs are unsuccessful, we may fail to retain existing customers and attract new customers, which could limit the growth of our revenues or profitability or result in a decline in our revenues or profitability. Moreover, because franchisees are required to pay us marketing and advertising fees based on a percentage of their revenues, our marketing fund expenditures are dependent upon sales volumes of our franchisees.\nThe support of our franchisees is critical for the success of our marketing programs and any new strategic initiatives we seek to undertake. While we can mandate certain strategic initiatives through enforcement of our franchise agreements, we need the active support of our franchisees if the implementation of our marketing programs and strategic initiatives is to be successful. Although certain actions are required of our franchisees under the franchise agreements, there can be no assurance that our franchisees will continue to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives. The failure of our franchisees to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives would adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur launch of a new franchise brand or other business ventures may be unsuccessful and consume significant management and financial resources.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we launched a new franchise brand, SiempreTax+, designed to enable our franchisees to better serve Hispanic customers and to assist us in building out our franchise network. Although franchisees opened a significant number of SiempreTax+ offices for the 2018, 2017 and 2016 tax seasons, the launch of a new nationwide brand involves substantial risks and uncertainties, and the interest of prospective franchisees and customers in the new brand may not be sufficient to permit us to grow the brand as rapidly as we hope. We expended significant management time and start-up expenses during the first year of this brand, and if the brand is not successful or falls short of anticipated growth, we may be adversely affected by continued expenses and the diversion of management time to this initiative at the expense of our core Liberty Tax brand. In the future, we may also launch additional business brands or initiatives which could negatively impact our financial performance if unsuccessful or underperforming.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Industry\nFederal and state regulators may impose new regulations on non-loan tax settlement products that would make those products more expensive for us to offer or more difficult for our customers to obtain.\nConsumer advocacy organizations and some government officials have asserted that non-loan tax settlement products, such as the refund transfer products we offer, should be treated as loan products or otherwise be more heavily regulated. These groups assert that refund transfer products and similar products are loans because most customers complete the payment for their tax preparation and related fees at the time their refund is disbursed, and therefore, the customer has received an extension of credit because of a purported deferral of the tax preparation fees until the refund is received. We are subject to a judgment in the State of California that treats refund transfer product products that we provide in that state as if they were extensions of credit. In addition, certain litigation discussed below involving us and others in the tax industry include claims that refund transfer products and similar products constitute loans or extensions of credit. If other state or federal courts or agencies successfully require us to treat refund transfer products as if they are loans or extensions of credit, we may be subject to the cost of additional regulation, including disclosure requirements that could reduce the demand for these products by potential\ncustomers and may be subject to limitations on our ability to offer these products, which could materially adversely affect our operations. See \"Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe may be unsuccessful in litigation that characterizes refund transfer products as loans, which could subject us to damages and additional regulation, and which could adversely affect our ability to offer tax settlement products and have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe were sued in November 2011 in four states, and additional lawsuits have been filed in five other states since the initial filings. These cases have now been consolidated before a single judge in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois. The consolidated complaint alleges violations of state-specific refund anticipation loan and other consumer statutes alleging that a refund transfer product represents a form of refund anticipation loan because the taxpayer is \u201cloaned\u201d the tax preparation fee, and that a refund transfer product is, therefore, subject to federal truth-in-lending disclosure and state law requirements regulating refund anticipation loans. We are aware that virtually identical lawsuits were filed against three of our competitors. In June 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement in this case in order to minimize the expense of litigation and the risk attendant to the litigation. Although this case was resolved through a settlement, the underlying issue may be the subject of additional regulation and litigation. We may also become subject to existing state regulations governing refund anticipation loans (in the states that have such regulations) and the costs of additional regulation, including disclosure requirements, and we may be subject to limitations on our ability to offer these products. These additional disclosure requirements could reduce the demand for these products by potential customers, and the possible application of state lending and other refund anticipation loan-related statutes and regulations might adversely affect our fee income to the extent those statutes or regulations impose limitations on fees that we now charge in connection with refund transfer products. If it becomes more difficult for us and our franchisees to offer these products to taxpayers, or if we are subject to damages in future litigation, it could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial results. See \u201cItem 1 - Business-Regulation-Potential regulation of refund transfer products or treatment of refund transfer products as loans or extensions of credit.\u201d\nThe failure by us, our franchisees, the financial institutions, and other lenders that provide tax settlement products to our customers through us and our franchisees, to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including with respect to tax return preparation or tax settlement products, could result in substantial sanctions against us or require changes to our business practices that could harm our profitability and reputation.\nOur tax return preparation business, including our franchise operations and facilitation of tax settlement products, are subject to extensive regulation and oversight in the United States by the IRS, the FTC, and by federal and state regulatory and law enforcement agencies and similar entities in Canada. The profitability of our future operations will, therefore, depend in large part on our continued ability to comply with federal and state franchise regulations, and in Canada, on our continued\nability to comply with Canadian and provincial franchise regulations. If governmental agencies with jurisdiction over our operations were to conclude that our business practices, the practices of our franchisees, or those of financial institutions and other lenders with which we conduct our business violate applicable laws, we could become subject to sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These sanctions may include, without limitation:\n\u2022\ncivil monetary damages and penalties,\n\u2022\ncriminal penalties, and\n\u2022\ninjunctions or other restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our business.\nIn addition, the financial institutions and other providers of tax settlement products to our customers are also subject to significant regulation and oversight by federal and state regulators, including banking regulators. The failure of these providers to comply with the regulatory requirements of federal and state government regulatory bodies, including banking and consumer protection laws, could affect their ability to continue to provide tax settlement products to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur customers' inability to obtain tax settlement products through our tax return preparation offices could cause our revenues or profitability to decline. We also may be required to change business practices, which could alter the way tax settlement products are facilitated and could cause our revenues or profitability to decline.\nFederal and state legislators and regulators have taken an active role in regulating tax settlement products and, because our ability to offer these products in future tax seasons may be limited, demand for our services may be reduced, we may be exposed to additional credit risk, and our business may be harmed.\nFinancial institutions that provide or otherwise facilitate tax settlement products are subject to significant regulation and oversight by federal and state regulators, including banking regulators. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters relating to the offering of consumer loan products, such as Refund Advances and consumer deposit products such as refund transfers. From time to time, government officials at the federal and state levels may introduce and enact legislation and regulations proposing to further regulate or prevent the facilitation of refund-based loans and other tax settlement products and take other actions that have the effect of restricting the availability of these products. In July 2011, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to administer and enforce consumer protection laws and regulation in the financial sector. Certain proposed legislation, regulations, and activities by CFPB or other regulators could increase costs to us, our franchisees, the financial institutions, and other parties that provide our tax settlement products or could negatively impact or eliminate the ability of financial institutions to provide or facilitate tax settlement products through tax return preparation offices.\nEven if we were to develop relationships that allow our customers to obtain refund-related loans through non-bank lenders, the laws and regulations that apply to those financial institutions and us may make these products more expensive to offer or limit their availability to our customers. In addition, many states have statutes regulating through licensing and other requirements the activities of brokering loans and providing credit services to consumers as well as payday loan laws and local usury laws. Some state regulators are interpreting these laws in a manner that could adversely affect the manner in which tax settlement products are facilitated, or permitted, or result in fines or penalties to us or our franchisees. Some states are introducing and enacting legislation that would seek to directly apply such laws to the facilitators of refund-based loans. Additional states may interpret these laws in a manner that is adverse to how we currently conduct our business or how we have conducted our business in the past, and we may be required to change business practices or otherwise comply with these statutes and could be subject to fines, penalties, or other payments related to past conduct.\nIf our financial product service providers become unable or unwilling to enable us to offer refund transfer products, we may be unable to offer tax settlement products to our customers.\nOur ability to offer refund transfer products (as well as other tax settlement products that require the creation of a customer bank account) is dependent on the ability and willingness of our financial product service providers to make available to our customers the bank accounts into which their tax refunds are deposited. If any of the federal or state regulatory authorities with the power to regulate these service providers prevents or makes it more difficult for our service providers to make these bank accounts available to our customers or if the service providers determine that they no longer wish to participate in these transactions, we may be unable to find alternative service providers that will be willing to provide the required number of bank accounts to our customers. If we are unable to make bank accounts available for refund transfer\nproducts, we will not be able to enable our customers to utilize these accounts for the direct deposit of their federal and state tax returns, which would materially affect our ability to offer tax settlement products to those customers. In addition, statutes applicable to acceptable refund transfer fees are state specific which may adversely affect how we currently conduct or have conducted our business in the past and may require change to such business practices to otherwise comply with these statutes and could be subject to fines, penalties, or other payments related to past conduct.\nRegulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to additional federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in the areas of franchise, labor, immigration, advertising, consumer protection, financial services and products, payment processing, privacy, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety, insurance, and healthcare. There have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government in some of these areas, including, for example, healthcare, consumer financial services and products, and labor, including overtime and exemption regulations and state and local laws on minimum wage and other labor-related issues. There may be additional regulatory actions or enforcement priorities, or new interpretations of existing requirements that differ from ours. These developments could impose unanticipated limitations or require changes to our business, which may make elements of our business more expensive, less efficient, or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future services or products, which effects may be heightened given the nature, broad geographic scope, and seasonality of our business.\nIncreased regulation of tax return preparers could make it more difficult to find qualified tax preparers and could harm our business.\nFrom time to time, the federal government and various states consider regulations regarding the education, testing, licensing, certification, and registration of tax return preparers. Although the IRS\u2019 effort to implement a new model for tax return preparer regulation has been declared invalid by a federal appeals court, Congressional action authorizing mandatory regulation may be adopted in the future, and various states have begun to fill the void created by the absence of federal tax return preparer regulation by proposing new or enhanced regulatory requirements at the state level. Although we believe that our training for preparers already exceeds the requirements the IRS had proposed and that states have adopted or have proposed, regulation of tax return preparers could impact our ability to find an adequate number of tax return preparers to meet the demands of our customers and impose additional costs on us and our franchisees to train tax return preparers, which could cause our revenues and profitability to decline.\nImmigration reform may lead our customers to seek our assistance with matters related to immigration reform and may subject us to additional regulatory risk.\nWe believe that any material immigration reform, whether implemented by executive action or by Congress, will necessarily involve the use of prior tax returns as a means by which undocumented immigrants may demonstrate their presence in the United States and compliance with federal and state tax laws. We anticipate that any additional customers we might obtain because of this opportunity to prepare additional tax returns may also seek our assistance in their efforts to comply with whatever processes are implemented to enable undocumented immigrants to take advantage of the benefits of any immigration reform initiatives. We and our franchisees may be subject to state restrictions on the unauthorized practice of law, and other federal and state restrictions regarding who may advise individuals with respect to immigration matters, and failure to comply with these regulatory restrictions may subject us and our franchisees to enforcement action and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Changes in Tax Laws and Regulations\nNew or revised tax regulations could have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe tax environment in which we operate is evolving rapidly with the recent enactment of sweeping corporate tax changes. The President of the United States signed into law tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including: (1) a reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%; (2) a limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses); (3) a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks; (4) immediate deductions for certain new investments (instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time); (5) limitations of certain executive compensation deductions; and (6) limitations or repeals of many business deductions and credits. In addition to cutting the corporate tax rate, the Tax Act also lowers individual income tax rates and increases the standard deduction, making it easier for many individuals to file their own taxes or use our online, digital \u201cDo It Yourself\u201d tax program.\nThe effect of the Tax Act on us may also be affected by future regulations and interpretations of the IRS regarding the Tax Act and the long-term effect is difficult to predict. Additionally, we operate in many states and are subject to the tax laws of those states. We are unable to predict how we may be affected by changes, or lack of changes, to state tax laws that may be made in response to the Tax Act by the states in which we operate. Accordingly, the risk exists that the Tax Act, IRS regulations and interpretations of the Tax Act and changes in, or lack of changes in, state tax laws could materially and adversely affect our business cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation and the frequency of tax law changes, government initiatives that simplify tax return preparation, reduce the need for a third-party tax return preparer, or lower the number of returns required to be filed may decrease demand for our services and financial products.\nMany taxpayers seek assistance from paid tax return preparers such as Liberty Tax Service because of the level of complexity involved in tax return preparation and filing and frequent changes in the tax laws. From time to time politicians and government officials propose measures seeking to simplify the preparation and filing of tax returns. The passage of any measures that significantly simplify tax return preparation or reduce the need for third-party tax return preparers may be highly detrimental to our business. In addition, any changes or other initiatives that result in a decrease in the number of tax returns filed or reduce the size of tax refunds could reduce demand for our products and services causing our revenues or profitability to decline.\nFor example, several members of Congress have proposed legislation that would authorize or require the IRS to allow taxpayers to access web-based tax preparation tools that would include \u201cpre-populated\u201d tax return forms that would presumably include data provided to the IRS from other government agencies, such as the Social Security Administration. If these or similar proposals are enacted, many tax customers might elect those services rather than paid tax preparation or the use of fee-based tax software or online tax preparation.\nInitiatives that improve the timing and efficiency of processing tax returns could reduce the attractiveness of the tax settlement products offered to our customers and demand for our services.\nOur performance depends on our ability to offer access to tax settlement products that increase the speed and efficiency by which our customers can receive their refunds. The federal government and various state and local municipalities have, from time to time, announced initiatives designed to modernize their operations and improve the timing and efficiency of processing tax returns. For example, during a prior tax season, the U.S. Department of Treasury introduced a prepaid debit card pilot program designed to facilitate the refund process. If tax authorities are able to significantly increase the speed and efficiency with which they process tax returns, the value and attractiveness of the tax settlement products offered to our customers and demand for our services could be reduced.\nDelays in the passage of tax laws and the implementation by the federal or state governments could harm our business.\nThe enactment of tax legislation occurring late in the calendar year could result in the beginning of tax filing season being delayed or make it difficult for us to make necessary changes on a timely basis to the software used by our franchisees to prepare tax returns. Any such delays could impact our revenues and profitability in any given year.\nProposals to make fundamental changes in the way tax refunds are processed or to impose price limitations on tax preparation, if enacted, could result in substantial losses of customers and other risks.\nSome regulators have suggested that it would be appropriate to allow taxpayers to \u201csplit\u201d their tax refunds, in a manner that would separate the payment of tax preparation fees from the balance of a customer's refund. In describing these proposals, some advocates have called for a cap on tax preparation fees that would adversely affect the ability of tax preparers to charge market prices for tax services and could reduce income to our franchisees, and therefore, to us. Other proposals have been advanced that would attempt to reduce tax refund fraud by significantly postponing the speed with which refunds are processed, or even postponing the processing of refunds until after the April 15 federal tax filing deadline. Such a change would likely have the effect of devaluing services that allow tax customers in the early portion of the tax season to receive their refunds on a more expedited basis that is available when electronic filing is not used and could therefore reduce the demand for the services we and our franchisees provide.\nThere can be no assurance that these proposals will be enacted at all or in their present form but if enacted, our growth and revenues could be adversely affected.\nOur participation in government programs designed to speed access to tax refunds may result in customer loss when the IRS fails to perform.\nThe IRS has responded to the increase in electronic filing by developing programs designed to reduce a taxpayer's wait to receive a tax refund. In the past, we participated in some programs offered by the IRS that did not perform as expected, resulting in significant delays in processing refunds for some of our customers. Although we continue to seek to give our customers quicker access to their refunds, doing so involves the risk of customer dissatisfaction and injury to our reputation in the market if the IRS fails to perform, which is outside our control.", "PERMNO": 13537, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "FRG"}
