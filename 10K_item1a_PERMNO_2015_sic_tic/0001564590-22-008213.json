{"cik": "700565", "company": "FIRST MID BANCSHARES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nVarious risks and uncertainties, some of which are difficult to predict and beyond the Company\u2019s control, could negatively impact the Company. As a financial institution, the Company is exposed to credit risk, interest rate and liquidity risk, operational risk, risks from economic and market conditions, and general business risks among others. Adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of its common stock.\nCredit Risks\nLoan customers or other counterparties may not be able to perform their contractual obligations resulting in a negative impact on the Company\u2019s earnings. Overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, including the current difficult economic conditions and market disruptions, could impact the Company\u2019s credit losses. In addition, real estate valuations could also impact the Company\u2019s credit losses as the Company maintains $2.8 billion in loans secured by commercial, agricultural, and residential real estate. A significant decline in real estate values could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s total loan balances by industry exceeded 25% of total risk-based capital for each of five industries as of December 31, 2021. A listing of these industries is contained in under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Loans\u201d herein. A significant change in one of these industries such as a significant decline in agricultural crop prices, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s credit losses.\nDeterioration in the real estate market could lead to losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations or the Company. Commercial and commercial real estate loans generally involve higher credit risks than residential real estate and consumer loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate or equipment are often dependent upon the successful operation and management of the underlying assets, repayment of such loans may be influenced to a great extent by conditions in the market or the economy. Increases in commercial and consumer delinquency levels or declines in real estate market values would require increased net charge-offs and increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nThe allowance for credit losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures. The Company\u2019s business depends on the creditworthiness of its customers. Management periodically reviews the allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that the allowance for credit losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowance for credit losses is not adequate, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information furnished by and on behalf of our customers and counterparties. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other financial information could cause the Company to enter into unfavorable transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest Rate and Liquidity Risks\nChanges in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings. Changes in market interest rates and prices may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. The Company\u2019s net interest income, its largest source of revenue, is highly dependent on achieving a positive spread between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to attract deposits, make loans, and achieve a positive spread resulting in compression of the net interest margin.\nDeclines in the value of securities held in the investment portfolio may negatively affect the Company\u2019s earnings and capital. The value of an investment in the portfolio could decrease due to changes in market factors. The market value of certain investment securities is volatile and future declines or other-than-temporary impairments could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s future earnings and capital. Continued volatility in the market value of certain of the investment securities, whether caused by changes in market perceptions of credit risk, as reflected in the expected market yield of the security, or actual defaults in the portfolio could result in significant fluctuations in the value of the securities. This could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s accumulated other comprehensive loss and shareholders\u2019 equity depending upon the direction of the fluctuations.\nFurthermore, future downgrades or defaults in these securities could result in future classifications as other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company has invested in trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and insurance companies, corporate securities of financial institutions, and stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Deterioration of the financial stability of the underlying financial institutions for these investments could result in other-than-temporary impairment charges to the Company and could have a material impact on future earnings. For further discussion of the Company\u2019s investments, see Note 4 - \u201cInvestment Securities.\u201d\nThe Company may not have sufficient cash or access to cash to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and for other corporate purposes. This type of liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. The Company\u2019s liquidity can be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, market disruption, operational problems affecting third parties or the Company, unfavorable pricing, competition, the Company\u2019s credit rating and regulatory restrictions. (See \u201cLiquidity\u201d herein for management\u2019s actions to mitigate this risk.)\nIf the Company were unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, it may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of its depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities. As seen starting in the middle of 2007, significant turmoil and volatility in worldwide financial markets can result in a disruption in the liquidity of financial markets and could directly impact the Company to the extent it needs to access capital markets to raise funds to support its business and overall liquidity position. These types of situations could affect the cost of such funds or the Company\u2019s ability to raise such funds. If the Company were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, it might be unable to meet customers\u2019 needs, which could adversely impact its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. For further discussion, see the \u201cLiquidity\u201d section.\nOperational Risks\nA failure in or breach of the Company's operational or security systems, or those of its third-party service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt the Company's business, result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage the Company's reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses. As a financial institution, the company's operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information on its computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the company's online banking system, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan servicing and other systems. The security and integrity of these systems could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic fraudulent activity, or attempted theft of financial assets. Management cannot assert that any such failures, interruption or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed. While certain protective policies and procedures are in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance these protective measures.\nAdditionally, the Company faces the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination, or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate its business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, its operational systems. Any failures, interruptions or security breaches in the Company's information systems could damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance.\nIf the Company\u2019s stock price declines from levels at December 31, 2021, management will evaluate the goodwill balance for impairment, and if the values of the business has declined, the Company could recognize an impairment charge for its goodwill. Management performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2021. Based on these analyses, management concluded that the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting units exceeded the fair value of its assets and liabilities and, therefore, goodwill was not considered impaired. It is possible that management\u2019s assumptions and conclusions regarding the valuation of the Company\u2019s lines of business could change adversely, which could result in the recognition of impairment for goodwill, which could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and future results of operations.\nHuman error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events may have adverse effects on the Company. Operational risk includes compliance or legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards. Operational risk also encompasses transaction risk, which includes losses from fraud, error, the inability to deliver products or services, and loss or theft of information. Losses resulting from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company\u2019s reputation or forgone opportunities. Any of these could potentially have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company is exposed to various business risks that could have a negative effect on the financial performance of the Company. These risks include changes in customer behavior, changes in competition, new litigation or changes to existing litigation, claims and assessments, environmental liabilities, real or threatened acts of war or terrorist activity, adverse weather, changes in accounting standards, legislative or regulatory changes, taxing authority interpretations, and an inability on the Company\u2019s part to retain and attract skilled employees.\nIn addition to these risks identified by the Company, investments in the Company\u2019s common stock involve risk. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors including volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies, changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of financial performance, and variations in quarterly or annual operating results.\nEconomic and Market Conditions Risks\nDifficult economic conditions and market disruption have adversely impacted the banking industry and financial markets generally and may again significantly affect the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company. The Company\u2019s success depends, to a certain extent, upon economic and political conditions, local and national, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely affect its asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, its earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the geographic region in which it operates. A large percentage of the Company\u2019s loans are to individuals and businesses in Illinois, consequently, any decline in the economy of this market area could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nDecline in the strength and stability of other financial institutions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. The actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions could affect the Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to different counterparties and executes transactions with various counterparties in the financial industry. Recent defaults by financial services institutions, and even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, led to market-wide liquidity problems in recent years and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. Any such losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) risks that could adversely affect its reputation and the market price of its securities. The Company is subject to a variety of risks arising from ESG matters. ESG matters include climate risk, hiring practices, the diversity of the work force, and racial and social justice issues involving the Company\u2019s personnel, customers and third parties with whom it otherwise does business. Risks arising from ESG matters may adversely affect, among other things, reputation and the market price of the Company\u2019s securities. Further, the Company may be exposed to negative publicity based on the identity and activities of those to whom it lends and with which it otherwise does business and the public\u2019s view of the approach and performance of its customers and business partners with respect to ESG matters. Any such negative publicity could arise from adverse news coverage in traditional media and could also spread through the use of social media platforms. The Company\u2019s relationships and reputation with its existing and prospective customers and third parties with which it does business could be damaged if it were to become the subject of any such negative publicity. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers and employees and could have a negative impact on the market price for securities. Investors have begun to consider the steps taken and resources allocated by financial institutions and other commercial organizations to address ESG matters when making investment and operational decisions. Certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies\u2019 responses to the risks posed by climate change and other ESG matters into their investment theses. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the market price of the Company\u2019s securities to the extent that investors determine that the Company has not made sufficient progress on ESG matters.\nThe Company\u2019s business could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled people. The Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best employees in most of the activities the Company engages in can be intense. The Company may not be able to hire the best people for key roles or retain them. In addition, the transition to increased work-from-home arrangements, which is likely to survive the COVID-19 pandemic for many companies, may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography. Our current or future approach to in-office and work-from-home arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to the arrangements offered by competitors, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain employees. The loss of any key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nClimate change could have a material negative impact on the Company and customers. The Company\u2019s business, as well as the operations and activities of its customers, could be negatively impacted by climate change. Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to the Company and its customers, and these risks are expected to increase over time. Climate change presents multi-faceted risks, including: operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on the Company and its customers\u2019 facilities and other assets; credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk; transition risks associated with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy; and reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about the Company\u2019s practices related to climate change, the Company\u2019s carbon footprint, and the Company\u2019s business relationships with clients who operate in carbon-intensive industries. Federal and state banking regulators and supervisory authorities, investors, and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their customers, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit, and reputational risks and costs. The risks associated with climate change are changing and evolving in an escalating fashion, making them difficult to assess due to limited data and other uncertainties. The Company could experience increased expenses resulting from strategic planning, litigation, and technology and market changes, and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to the Company\u2019s response to climate change and its climate change strategy, which, in turn, could have a material negative impact on business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR and other benchmark rates are determined could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Our floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the products that we offer, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, or to an index, currency, basket, or other financial metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. However, the administrator of LIBOR has proposed to extend publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings until June 30, 2023 and will cease publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in \u201cnew\u201d contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, which rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, started in May 2018 to publish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the Treasury repurchase market. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR will become a accepted alternative to LIBOR. The discontinuation of LIBOR, changes in LIBOR, or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of LIBOR as a benchmark could result in changes to our risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that we own or have issued. In addition, such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks associated with client disclosures, discretionary actions taken or negotiation of fallback provisions, systems disruption, business continuity, and model disruption.\nOther Business Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the measures intended to prevent its spread have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the Company's operations, results of operations and financial condition, and the severity of these adverse effects depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. The global health concerns related to COVID-19 and government actions implemented to reduce the spread of the virus have had an adverse impact on the macroeconomic environment. COVID-19 has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. These measures have significantly contributed to rising unemployment and negatively impacted consumer and business spending. The United States government has taken steps to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus, including the passage of the CARES Act, but there is no assurance that these steps will be effective or achieve the desired positive economic results in a timely fashion. COVID-19 has impacted, and is likely to further adversely impact, the workforce and operations of the Company, and the operations of our borrowers, customers, and business partners. In particular, we may experience financial losses due to various operational factors impacting us or our borrowers, customers, or business partners, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ncredit losses resulting from financial stress being experienced by our borrowers as a result of the outbreak and related governmental actions, particularly in the hospitality, energy, retail, and restaurant industries, but across other industries as well;\n\u2022\ndeclines in collateral values;\n\u2022\nthird party disruptions, including outages at network providers and other suppliers;\n\u2022\nincreased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online and remote activity; and\n\u2022\noperational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions.\nThese factors may remain prevalent for a significant period and may continue to adversely affect the Company, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided. The extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts the Company\u2019s operations, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. The full extent of the impacts on the Company\u2019s operations or the global economy as a whole is not yet known. However, the effects could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and heighten other of our known risks.\nThe Company may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders. To maintain capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, to replace existing capital, or to complete acquisitions the Company may be required to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. The Company may sell these shares at prices below the current market price of shares, and the sale of these shares may significantly dilute stockholder ownership. The Company could also issue additional shares in connection with acquisitions of other financial institutions.\nIf the Company is unable to make favorable acquisitions or successfully integrate our acquisitions, the Company\u2019s growth could be impacted. In the past several years, the Company has completed acquisitions of banks, bank branches and other businesses. We may continue to make such acquisitions in the future. When the Company evaluates acquisition opportunities, the Company evaluates whether the target institution has a culture similar to the Company, experienced management, and the potential to improve the financial performance of the Company. If the Company fails to successfully identify, complete, and integrate favorable acquisitions, the Company could experience slower growth. Acquiring other banks, bank branches or businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities or asset quality issues of the target institution, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target institution, potential disruption to the Company (including diversion of management\u2019s time and attention), difficulty in estimating the value of the target institution, and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target institution.\nThe Company and the banking industry are subject to government regulation, legislation, and policy. Government regulation, legislation and policy affect the Company and the banking industry as a whole, including the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. The Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in how existing regulations are interpreted or applied by government agencies, or by the adoption of new government regulation, legislation, and policy. These changes may require the Company to invest significant funds and management attention and resources in order to reach compliance. In addition, any enforcement matters could impact supervisory and CRA ratings, which may restrict or limit the Company\u2019s activities.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area. The Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, both within and beyond its principal markets, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and internet banks within the various markets in which the Company operates. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes and continued consolidation.", "PERMNO": 14653, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FMBH"}
