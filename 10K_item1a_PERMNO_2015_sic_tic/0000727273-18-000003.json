{"cik": "727273", "company": "CADIZ INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including those described below.\nWe May Not Be Able To Obtain the Financing We Need To Implement Our Asset Development Programs\nWe presently have sufficient funds to meet our expected working capital needs through April 2019, but will continue to require additional working capital to meet our cash resource needs until such time as our asset development programs, including the Water Project, produce revenues. If we cannot raise funds if and when needed, we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company. We cannot assure you that our current lenders, or any other lenders, will give us additional credit should we seek it. If we are unable to obtain additional credit, we may engage in further financings. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on the status of our asset development programs and general conditions in the capital markets at the time funding is sought. Any further equity or convertible debt financings would result in the dilution of ownership interests of our current stockholders. Additionally, our option to acquire an additional 124-mile extension of our Northern Pipeline will require a $20 million payment by December 2018. We do not currently have the cash resources on hand to exercise this option and have engaged an investment banker to pursue alternatives that will provide the resources to allow us to exercise this option. If we are unable to exercise this option, then our Northern Pipeline opportunities will be limited to the 96-mile segment we currently own.\nOur Development Activities Have Not Generated Significant Revenues\nAt present, our development activities include water resource and agricultural development at our San Bernardino County properties. We have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date and we do not know when, if ever, we will receive operating revenues sufficient to offset the costs of our development activities. As a result, we continue to incur a net loss from operations.\nWe May Never Generate Significant Revenues or Become Profitable Unless We Are Able to Successfully Implement Programs to Develop Our Land Assets and Related Water Resources\nWe do not know the terms, if any, upon which we may be able to proceed with our water and other development programs. Regardless of the form of our water development programs, the circumstances under which supplies or storage of water can be developed and the profitability of any supply or storage project are subject to significant uncertainties, including the risk of variable water supplies and changing water allocation priorities. Additional risks include our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and permits, litigation by environmental or other groups, unforeseen technical difficulties, general market conditions for water supplies, and the time needed to generate significant operating revenues from such programs after operations commence.\nThe Development of Our Properties Is Heavily Regulated, Requires Governmental Approvals and Permits That Could Be Denied, and May Have Competing Governmental Interests and Objectives\nIn developing our land assets and related water resources, we are subject to local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, resource protection, environmental impacts, infrastructure design, subdivision of land, construction and similar matters. Our development activities are subject to the risk of adverse interpretations or changes to U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies. Further, our development activities require governmental approvals and permits. If such permits were to be denied or granted subject to unfavorable conditions or restrictions, our ability to successfully implement our development programs would be adversely impacted.\nPrior to construction of the Water Project, terms for moving water supplies in the Colorado River Aqueduct must be negotiated with Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (\"Metropolitan\"), which owns and controls the CRA. Water Project supplies entering the CRA will comply with Metropolitan's published engineering, design and water quality standards and will be subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by Metropolitan for the conveyance of water within its service territory. The Metropolitan Board must consider and approve the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA to transport water to its participating agencies. The Project has not yet filed an application for access to the CRA at Metropolitan, but we expect such a formal application will be filed in 2018 as the Project's contractual arrangements with participants are finalized.\nIn July 2017, the California State Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Water passed Assembly Bill 1000 (\"AB 1000\"), which would add new permitting requirements for the conveyance of water from the Cadiz area within California's conveyance facilities, including the CRA. In September 2017, AB 1000 was held on the suspense file by the California Senate Committee on Appropriations stopping it from further consideration by the Legislature in 2017. If AB 1000 is taken off the suspense file in 2018, it would still be required to be considered by the full California State Senate, as well as the California State Assembly and the California Governor's office prior to becoming law. We cannot be certain whether AB 1000 would ever be adopted and, if so, to what extent AB 1000 would affect the permitting requirements for the Project.\nIn October 2017, the Company received a letter from the California State Lands Commission (\"Commission\") advising that the Commission recently determined for the first time that the State of California owns \"in fee\" a 200-foot-wide, 1-mile long strip of land beneath the existing Arizona and California Railroad (\"ARZC\") right-of-way within which we plan to construct the Water Project's conveyance pipeline. The Commission letter asserts that if the Company intends to cross the parcel, we would require a lease from the Commission subject to additional environmental review. The Company cannot predict with certainty at this time whether or not a lease from the Commission will be required or pursued, as the Company already holds a lease from the ARZC to access its right-of-way over this parcel.\nFinally, the statutes, regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge proposed plans and approvals. Opposition from third parties will cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely. While we have worked with representatives of various environmental and third-party interests and agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects, certain groups may remain opposed to our development plans and pursue legal action.\nOur Failure to Make Timely Payments of Principal and Interest on Our Indebtedness May Result in a Foreclosure on Our Assets\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had total indebtedness outstanding to our lenders of approximately $133.6 million. Approximately $62.7 million of our indebtedness is secured by our assets and is due in May 2021 (see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\"). To the extent that we do not make principal and interest payments on the indebtedness when due, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of agreements governing our indebtedness, we may default on our obligations.\nThe Conversion of Our Outstanding Convertible Notes into Common Stock Would Dilute the Percentage of Our Common Stock Held by Current Stockholders\nIn connection with our March 2013 debt refinance (see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\"), we issued approximately $53.5 million in convertible notes, under which principal and accrued interest were convertible into common stock at $8.05 per share at the election of our noteholders prior to maturity in March 2018 (the \"2018 Convertible Notes\"). In December 2015, certain of the noteholders exchanged their 2018 Convertible Notes for new convertible notes under which principal and accrued interest can be converted into common stock at $6.75 per share at the election of the noteholders prior to a maturity date in March 2020 (the \"2020 Convertible Notes\"). In April 2016, we issued an additional $8.0 million in original principal amount of the 2020 Notes. As of the date of filing of this annual report, our lenders have converted $12.0 million in original principal amount of the notes, leaving a balance of $49.5 million in original principal amount of these notes. An election by our lenders to convert all or a portion of principal and accrued interest under the 2020 Convertible Notes into common stock will dilute the percentage of our common stock held by current stockholders up to 10.4 million shares as of the date of filing of this annual report, and up to an additional 1.6 million shares if held to maturity.\nThe Issuance of Equity Securities Under Management Equity Incentive Plans Will Impact Earnings\nOur compensation programs for management emphasize long-term incentives, primarily through the issuance of equity securities and options to purchase equity securities. It is expected that plans involving the issuance of shares, options, or both will be submitted from time to time to our stockholders for approval. In the event that any such plans are approved and implemented, the issuance of shares and options under such plans may result in the dilution of the ownership interest of other stockholders and will, under currently applicable accounting rules, result in a charge to earnings based on the value of our common stock at the time of issue and the fair value of options at the time of their award. The expense would be recorded over the vesting period of each stock and option grant.\nThe Volatility of Our Stock Price Could Adversely Affect Current and Future Stockholders\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and fluctuates in response to various factors which are beyond our control. Such fluctuations are particularly common in companies such as ours, which have not generated significant revenues. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially:\n\u00b7\ndevelopments involving the execution of our business plan;\n\u00b7\ndisclosure of any adverse results in litigation;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments affecting our ability to develop our properties;\n\u00b7\nthe dilutive effect or perceived dilutive effect of additional debt or equity financings;\n\u00b7\nperceptions in the marketplace of our company and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock markets, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Price volatility could be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.\nOur Conditional Commitment From Apollo Remain Subject to Closing Conditions\nIn 2017, funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\") executed a conditional commitment letter to fund up to $240 million in construction finance expenditures for the Cadiz Water Project, subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent. The conditional commitment is intended to provide additional resources necessary to complete the construction of Phase I of the Water Project. Apollo's commitment for up to $240 million is conditional and subject to a number of conditions, many of which are not within the Company's control, and the Company is not obligated to accept such financing from Apollo. If the $240 million commitment does not close, the Company will need to seek financing from other sources.", "PERMNO": 85570, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "CDZI"}
