{"cik": "1652923", "company": "AveXis, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this Annual Report, as well as general economic and business risks, together with any other documents we file with the SEC. If any of the following events actually occur or risks actually materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks related to our financial position and need for capital\nWe have incurred net losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant net losses. Our net losses were $218.1 million, $83.0 million and $38.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an\naccumulated deficit of $359.6 million. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical development of our gene therapy product candidate, AVXS-101, investing in our manufacturing facility and manufacturing equipment, as well as to building out our management team and infrastructure. We expect that it could be several years, if ever, before we have a commercialized product candidate. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if, and as, we:\n\u00b7\ncontinue our research and the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidate, including our pivotal clinical trial for SMA Type 1, our Phase 1 clinical trial for SMA Type 2 and other planned clinical trials for AVXS-101;\n\u00b7\ninitiate additional clinical trials and preclinical studies for any additional product candidates that we may pursue in the future, including trials and studies related to our preclinical programs for Rett syndrome and a genetic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene, or genetic ALS;\n\u00b7\nprepare our biologics license application, or BLA, and marketing authorization application for AVXS-101;\n\u00b7\nmanufacture current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, material for clinical trials or potential commercial sales;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to establish and validate our commercial-scale cGMP manufacturing facility;\n\u00b7\nfurther develop our gene therapy product candidate portfolio;\n\u00b7\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u00b7\ndevelop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7\nacquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; and\n\u00b7\nseek marketing approval for AVXS-101 in the European Union and in other key geographies.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize one or more product candidates with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of AVXS-101 and other future product candidates, developing and validating commercial scale manufacturing processes, obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling any future product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We currently only have one product candidate, AVXS-101, and we may never acquire, in-license or develop additional product candidates. We may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company also could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product and biological product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of AVXS-101, our expenses could increase and revenue could be further delayed.\nWe have never generated revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nOur ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborative partners, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize, AVXS-101 and any additional product candidates that we may pursue in the future. We do not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for the next few years, if ever. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our, or our future collaborators\u2019, success in:\n\u00b7\ncompleting research and preclinical and clinical development of AVXS-101 and any future product candidates in a timely and successful manner;\n\u00b7\nseeking and obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for AVXS-101 and any future product candidates for which we complete clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nlaunching and commercializing AVXS-101 and any future product candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval by establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure or, alternatively, collaborating with a commercialization partner;\n\u00b7\nqualifying for coverage and adequate reimbursement by government and third-party payors for AVXS-101 and any future product candidates both in the U.S. and internationally;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining and enhancing a commercially viable, sustainable, scalable, reproducible and transferable manufacturing process for AVXS-101 and any future product candidates that is compliant with cGMPs;\n\u00b7\nestablishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate, in both amount and quality, products and services as needed to support clinical development and the market demand for our product candidates, if approved;\n\u00b7\nobtaining market acceptance, if and when approved, of our product candidates as viable treatment options by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;\n\u00b7\neffectively addressing any competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7\nimplementing additional internal systems and infrastructure, as needed;\n\u00b7\nnegotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter and performing our obligations in such collaborations;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how;\n\u00b7\navoiding and defending against third-party interference or infringement claims; and\n\u00b7\nattracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if any product candidate that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities require us to perform clinical and other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe are a development-stage company founded in 2010, and we did not begin research and development activities for the treatment of SMA with AVXS-101 until 2013. Our efforts to date, with respect to the development of AVXS-101, have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring our technology, identifying AVXS-101 as a potential gene therapy product candidate, undertaking clinical trials of that product candidate, investing in our manufacturing facility and manufacturing equipment and establishing collaborations. We have not yet demonstrated the ability to complete late stage clinical trials of AVXS-101 or any other product candidate, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial-scale product or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had more experience developing gene therapy products.\nWe do not currently have the ability to perform the sales, marketing and manufacturing functions necessary for the production and sale of AVXS-101 on a commercial scale. Our only product candidate is AVXS-101, which may be required to undergo significant additional clinical trials before it can be commercialized, if at all. The successful commercialization of AVXS-101 will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u00b7\ncontinuing clinical development of AVXS-101;\n\u00b7\nobtaining required regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nformulating and manufacturing product candidates; and\n\u00b7\nconducting sales and marketing activities.\nWe expect our financial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We will need to transition at some point from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of undertaking commercial activities. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and may not be successful in such a transition.\nWe may need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate certain of our product development efforts or other operations.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, initiate further clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, AVXS-101. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidate, we expect to incur significant expenses related to product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. While we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our current operating plans into 2020, we anticipate that we may need additional funding to complete the development of AVXS-101 and any future product candidates and commercialize any such products.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe progress and results of our current and planned clinical trials of AVXS-101;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, laboratory testing, manufacturing, preclinical development and clinical trials for any other product candidates that we may pursue in the future, if any including related to our preclinical programs for Rett syndrome and genetic ALS;\n\u00b7\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of AVXS-101 and any other product candidates we may develop;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of continuing to establish and maintain our own commercial-scale cGMP manufacturing facility;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with the manufacturing process development and evaluation of potential third-party manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for AVXS-101 or any other product candidates we may develop for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nrevenue, if any, received from commercial sale of AVXS-101 or other product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u00b7\nour current collaboration and license agreements remaining in effect and our achievement of milestones under those agreements;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations and licenses on favorable terms, if at all; and\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our product revenues, if any, will be derived from or based on sales of product candidates that may not be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities, the issuance of those securities could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or additional equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRisks related to the development of AVXS-101 and any future product candidates\nThe development and commercialization of AVXS-101, or any other product candidates we may develop, is subject to many risks. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize any product candidate, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe are currently focusing our development efforts on solely one gene therapy product candidate, AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA. We also intend to develop product candidates for the treatment of Rett syndrome and genetic ALS and intend to in-license or develop additional product candidates for the treatment of other rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases. The development and commercialization of AVXS-101 or any other product candidate we may develop is subject to many risks, including:\n\u00b7\nthe FDA will require additional clinical trials beyond what we currently expect prior to approval of AVXS-101 or any future product candidate;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from our preclinical studies and clinical studies or may require that we conduct additional studies;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may disagree with our proposed design of future clinical trials of AVXS-101 or any future product candidate;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may not accept data generated at our clinical study sites;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of our product candidate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects of any product candidate could delay or prevent commercialization, limit the indications for any approved product candidate, require the establishment of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or cause an approved product candidate to be taken off the market;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may identify deficiencies in our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations;\n\u00b7\nthe third-party manufacturers we expect to depend on to supply or manufacture our product candidates may not produce adequate supply;\n\u00b7\nwe, or our third-party manufacturers may not be able to source or produce cGMP materials for the production of AVXS-101 or any future product candidate;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to manufacture our drugs at a cost or in quantities necessary to make commercially successful products;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to obtain adequate supply of AVXS-101 or any future product candidate for our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe depend on clinical research organizations, or CROs, to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience delays in the commencement of, enrollment of patients in and timing of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to demonstrate that our product candidate is safe and effective as a treatment for its indications to the satisfaction of the FDA or other similar regulatory bodies, and we may not be able to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our products;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to maintain a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following approval;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to establish or maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements;\n\u00b7\nthe market may not accept AVXS-101 or any other product candidate we may develop;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to establish and maintain an effective sales and marketing infrastructure, either through the creation of a commercial infrastructure or through strategic collaborations, and the effectiveness of our own or any future strategic collaborators\u2019 marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations will affect our profitability;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to successfully develop and expand our sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for AVXS-101 or any future product candidate, nor to successfully launch commercial sales if we obtain marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u00b7\nwe and our licensors may be unable to successfully obtain, maintain, defend and enforce intellectual property rights important to protect AVXS-101 or any future product candidate; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors.\nIf any of these risks materializes, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize AVXS-101 or any other product candidate we may develop, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAVXS-101 is based on a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval. To our knowledge, only a limited number of gene therapies have been approved in the United States and the European Union and commercialization efforts are still preliminary.\nWe have concentrated our research and development efforts on AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA and our future success depends on our successful development of that product candidate. There can be no assurance that we will not experience problems or delays in developing our product candidate and that such problems or delays will not cause unanticipated costs, or that any such development problems can be solved. We may also experience unanticipated problems or delays in expanding our manufacturing capacity through our own internal supply network or potential third party manufacturers, which would prevent us from completing our clinical trials, meeting the obligations of our collaborations, or commercializing our product candidates on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. For example, we may uncover a previously unknown risk associated with AVXS-101 or risks we are aware of, such as the elevated liver function enzymes we observed in the patients treated in the Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101, may be more problematic than we currently believe and this may prolong the period of observation required for obtaining regulatory approval or may necessitate additional clinical testing.\nIn addition, the product specifications and the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of such product candidate. For example, the FDA and the EMA have different requirements regarding what constitutes an acceptable antibiotic-resistant genetic marker for plasmid selection needed for the production of AVXS-101. From an FDA perspective, both ampicillin-resistant and kanamycin-resistant genetic markers are acceptable, while from an EMA perspective, only kanamycin-resistant genetic markers are acceptable. As a result, we have transitioned to kanamycin-resistant plasmid\nselection for all future clinical trials, including clinical trials to be conducted in the European Union. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours is unclear and can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied product candidates. To our knowledge, only three gene therapy products, Novartis\u2019 Kymriah, Gilead Sciences\u2019 Yescarta and Spark Therapeutics\u2019 Luxturna, have received approval from the FDA and two gene therapy products, uniQure N.V.\u2019s Glybera and GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s Strimvelis, have received marketing authorization from the European Commission; however, uniQure announced that it does not plan to renew the marketing authorization for Glybera in Europe. As a result, it is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for AVXS-101 in either the United States or the European Union or how long it will take to commercialize our product candidate. Approvals by the FDA may not be indicative of what the European Commission may require for approval and vice versa.\nRegulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. The FDA has established the Office of Tissue and Advanced Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER in its review. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the United States National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, also are potentially subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities\u2019 Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or the RAC; however, the NIH announced that the RAC will only publicly review clinical trials if the trials cannot be evaluated by standard oversight bodies and pose unusual risks. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC public review process, if undertaken, can delay the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial design and details and approved its initiation. Conversely, the FDA can put an IND on a clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable review or an exemption from in-depth, public review. If we were to engage an NIH-funded institution to conduct a clinical trial, that institution\u2019s institutional biosafety committee as well as its institutional review board, or IRB, would need to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other oversight bodies to change the requirements for approval of our product candidate. Similarly, the EMA may issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for gene therapy medicinal products and require that we comply with these new guidelines.\nThese regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of AVXS-101 or future product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance AVXS-101, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups, and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of AVXS-101. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nBreakthrough therapy designation by the FDA and access to Priority Medicines, or PRIME, by the EMA may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval process for AVXS-101, and it does not increase the likelihood that any of our product candidates will receive marketing approval in the United States and Europe, respectively.\nWe have received breakthrough therapy designation for AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 in pediatric patients, and may, in the future, apply for breakthrough therapy designation for other product candidates in the United States. A breakthrough therapy product candidate is defined as a product candidate that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that such product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: (i) intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; (ii) intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and\n(iii) a rolling review process whereby the FDA may consider reviewing portions of a BLA before the sponsor submits the complete application. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may be eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and, in any event, does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even though AVXS-101 has been designated as a breakthrough therapy product candidate, the FDA may later decide that it no longer meets the conditions for designation or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nAccess to the PRIME initiative is granted by the European Medicines Agency, to support the development and accelerate the review of new therapies to treat patients with unmet medical need. The receipt of this access for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to products considered for approval under conventional EMA procedures and, in any event, does not assure ultimate approval by the EMA. In addition, even though AVXS-101 has been granted access to PRIME, the EMA may later decide that it no longer meets the conditions for such access.\nSuccess in preclinical studies or early clinical trials, including in our Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101, may not be indicative of results obtained in later trials or provide support for submission of a marketing application.\nResults from preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials such as our Phase 1 clinical trial are not necessarily predictive of future clinical trial results, and interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily indicative of final results. AVXS-101 may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in clinical development despite positive results in preclinical studies and our Phase 1 clinical trial. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that AVXS-101 is safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon AVXS-101. Our Phase 1 clinical trial involved a small patient population and the duration of treatment has been relatively short. In addition, our Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101 did not include a placebo control. Because of the small sample size and other changes to the design of the clinical trial that we implemented in our pivotal trial based on feedback from the FDA during our September 2016 Type B meeting and the meeting minutes, the results of our Phase 1 clinical trial may not be indicative of results of future clinical trials, including our pivotal trial.\nThere is a high failure rate for drugs and biologic products proceeding through clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, we may experience regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including due to changes in regulatory policy during the period of our product candidate development. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate. Frequently, product candidates that have shown promising results in early clinical trials have subsequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. Our company has limited experience in designing clinical trials and we may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval. In our Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101, we used event-free survival as the efficacy endpoint, with an \u201cevent\u201d defined as death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively. Although none of the patients who received the proposed therapeutic dose of AVXS-101 experienced an event as of August 7, 2017, one patient in the low-dose cohort experienced an event as classified by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, that was determined by independent review to represent progression of disease and not to be related to the use of AVXS-101. Clinical trials are inherently unpredictable, and there are no assurances that these patients enrolled in the Phase 1 trial will not experience an event in the future. Furthermore, although the FDA indicated its preference for survival, such as time to an event, as a co-primary endpoint for the pivotal trial, there is no assurance that the FDA will determine event-free survival to be an acceptable efficacy\nendpoint following its review of the final results of the pivotal trial. While the FDA also indicated its preference for the pivotal trial to include the achievement of certain motor milestones, such as sitting unassisted, as a potential co-primary endpoint, there is no assurance that the FDA will determine that the achievement of these milestones will be an acceptable efficacy endpoint following its review of the final results of the pivotal trial. The FDA may not accept either or both of these endpoints as a measure of efficacy, which could result in a delay in approval of AVXS-101. Any such delays could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent us from proceeding with clinical trials of AVXS-101.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of AVXS-101 is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on our ability to recruit patients to participate as well as completion of required follow-up periods. If patients are unwilling to participate in our gene therapy studies because of negative publicity from adverse events related to the biotechnology or gene therapy fields, competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, clinical trials in products employing our vector or our platform or for other reasons, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of AVXS-101 may be delayed. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing AVXS-101, delays in testing the effectiveness of AVXS-101 or termination of clinical trials altogether.\nWe may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics, to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Patient enrollment and trial completion is affected by factors including:\n\u00b7\nsize of the patient population and process for identifying subjects;\n\u00b7\ndesign of the trial protocol;\n\u00b7\neligibility and exclusion criteria;\n\u00b7\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u00b7\nperceived risks and benefits of gene therapy-based approaches to treatment of diseases;\n\u00b7\navailability of competing therapies and clinical trials, including Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Biogen\u2019s SPINRAZATM (nusinersen), which was approved by the FDA in December 2016 for use in a broad range of SMA patients, including for the treatment of SMA Type 1;\n\u00b7\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u00b7\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective subjects;\n\u00b7\nability to obtain and maintain subject consent;\n\u00b7\nrisk that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion of the trial;\n\u00b7\npatient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u00b7\nability to monitor subjects adequately during and after treatment.\nAVXS-101 is being developed to treat a rare condition. We plan to seek initial marketing approval in the United States and the European Union. Subject to the results of our Phase 1 clinical trial and further discussions with the FDA, we currently anticipate that any pivotal trial of AVXS-101 could include using natural history of the disease as a comparator. Patients may opt not to enroll in our pivotal trial because of the commercial availability of another treatment\nfor the disease. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or the EMA or other regulatory authorities. Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including:\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in establishing or managing relationships with CROs and physicians;\n\u00b7\ndifferent standards for the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nabsence in some countries of established groups with sufficient regulatory expertise for review of gene therapy protocols;\n\u00b7\nour inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners; and\n\u00b7\nthe potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatment.\nIf we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients or finding additional clinical sites to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause the number of subjects in our clinical trial to date is small and have all been treated at one clinical trial site, the results from our Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101 may be less reliable than results achieved in larger clinical trials.\nA study design that is considered appropriate includes a sufficiently large sample size with appropriate statistical power, as well as proper control of bias, to allow a meaningful interpretation of the results. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, we analyzed the effect of AVXS-101 on SMA Type 1 in 15 patients at one clinical site. The preliminary results of studies with smaller sample sizes and at a single site, such as our Phase 1 clinical trial, can be disproportionately influenced by the impact the treatment had on a few individuals, which limits the ability to generalize the results across a broader community, thus making the study results less reliable than studies with a larger number of subjects. As a result, there may be less certainty that AVXS-101 would achieve a statistically significant effect in any future clinical trials. In any future clinical trials of AVXS-101, we may not achieve a statistically significant result or the same level of statistical significance, if any, seen in our Phase 1 clinical trial.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of AVXS-101 or other product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of that product candidate for its intended indications. Clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching a consensus with regulatory authorities on trial design;\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in opening clinical trial sites or obtaining required IRB or independent Ethics Committee approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u00b7\ndelays in recruiting suitable subjects to participate in our future clinical trials, including because such trials may be placebo-controlled trials and patients are not guaranteed to receive treatment with our product candidate when an approved product is available, which may be exacerbated given the rare conditions of SMA, Rett syndrome and genetic ALS;\n\u00b7\nimposition of a clinical hold by regulatory authorities as a result of a serious adverse event or after an inspection of our clinical trial operations, trial sites or manufacturing facilities;\n\u00b7\nfailure by us, any CROs we engage or any other third parties to adhere to clinical trial requirements;\n\u00b7\nfailure to perform in accordance with FDA good clinical practices, or GCP, or applicable regulatory guidelines in the European Union and other countries;\n\u00b7\ndelays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of AVXS-101 or other product candidates to the clinical sites, including delays by third parties with whom we have contracted to perform certain of those functions;\n\u00b7\ndelays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\nclinical trial sites or subjects dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7\nselection of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;\n\u00b7\noccurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;\n\u00b7\noccurrence of serious adverse events in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other sponsors; or\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to AVXS-101 or other product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidate to earlier versions. Clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize AVXS-101 or other product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize AVXS-101 or other product candidates and may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, if the results of our clinical trials are inconclusive or if there are safety concerns or serious adverse events associated with AVXS-101 or other product candidates, we may:\n\u00b7\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for such product candidate, if at all;\n\u00b7\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u00b7\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u00b7\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u00b7\nbe subject to changes in the way the product is administered;\n\u00b7\nbe required to perform additional clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u00b7\nhave regulatory authorities withdraw, or suspend, their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified REMS;\n\u00b7\nbe subject to the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u00b7\nbe sued; or\n\u00b7\nexperience damage to our reputation.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nAs we evaluate and develop manufacturing process improvements to AVXS-101, we may be required to conduct comparability studies, which may result in delays to the development and approval process for our current or future programs and increased costs resulting from additional nonclinical trials.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate and develop manufacturing process improvements to AVXS-101. As a result, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require a clinical bridging study, or comparability study, showing comparability to prior batches of AVXS-101, which could delay the development process. For example, the FDA required us to complete a potency assay qualification study of AVXS-101 prior to initiating our pivotal clinical trial. If we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates in the future, we may need to conduct additional nonclinical studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u00b7\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u00b7\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u00b7\nbe subject to post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs also will increase if we experience delays in testing or regulatory approvals. We do not know whether any of our nonclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant nonclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. Any delays in our nonclinical or future clinical development programs may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAVXS-101 may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent its regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nDuring the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the product candidate being studied caused these conditions. Various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have been reported from time-to-time during the Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101. As of August 7, 2017, we observed a total of 56 serious adverse events in 13 patients, two of which were deemed treatment-related. Regulatory authorities may draw different conclusions or require additional testing to confirm these determinations. In addition, it is possible that as we test AVXS-101 or any other product candidate in larger, longer and more extensive clinical programs, or as use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by subjects. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational products are tested in large-scale, Phase 3 or pivotal clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a commercial scale after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that AVXS-101 or any other product candidate has side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or, if the product candidate has received regulatory approval, such approval may be revoked, which would severely harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nThere have been several significant adverse side effects in gene therapy treatments in the past, including reported cases of leukemia and death seen in other trials using other vectors. While new recombinant vectors have been developed to reduce these side effects, gene therapy is still a relatively new approach to disease treatment and additional adverse side effects could develop. There also is the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biologic activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material. Possible adverse side effects that could occur with treatment with gene therapy products include an immunologic reaction early after administration which, while not necessarily adverse to the patient\u2019s health, could substantially limit the effectiveness of the treatment. In previous clinical trials involving AAV vectors for gene therapy, some subjects experienced the development of a T-cell response, whereby after the vector is within the target cell, the cellular immune response system triggers the removal of transduced cells by activated T-cells. If our vectors demonstrate a similar effect we may decide or be required to halt or delay further clinical development of AVXS-101.\nIn addition to side effects caused by the product candidate, the administration process or related procedures also can cause adverse side effects. If any such adverse events occur, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated.\nIf in the future we are unable to demonstrate that such adverse events were caused by the administration process or related procedures, the FDA, the European Commission, the EMA or other regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, AVXS-101 for any or all targeted indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that any serious adverse events are not product-related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of AVXS-101, the commercial prospects of such product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from this product candidate may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates, and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, if AVXS-101 receives marketing approval, the FDA could require us to adopt a REMS to ensure that the benefits outweigh its risks, which may include, among other things, a medication guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients and a communication plan to health care practitioners. Furthermore, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by AVXS-101, several potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw approvals of such product candidate;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to change the way a product candidate is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of AVXS-101 and could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an organization, we have never completed pivotal clinical trials, and may be unable to do so for any product candidates we may develop, including AVXS-101.\nWe will need to successfully complete pivotal clinical trials in order to obtain FDA approval to market AVXS-101. Carrying out later-stage clinical trials and the submission of a successful BLA is a complicated process. As an organization, we have not previously conducted any later stage or pivotal clinical trials, have limited experience in preparing, submitting and prosecuting regulatory filings, and have not previously submitted a BLA for any product candidate. In addition, we have had limited interactions with the FDA and cannot be certain how many additional clinical trials of AVXS-101 will be required or how such trials should be designed. Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete necessary clinical trials in a way that leads to BLA submission and approval of AVXS-101. We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of product candidates that we develop. Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials, could prevent us from or delay us in commercializing AVXS-101.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, we cannot predict when, or if, we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize AVXS-101 and the approval may be for a narrower indication than we seek.\nWe cannot commercialize a product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Even if AVXS-101 meets its safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials, the regulatory authorities may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process.\nRegulatory authorities also may approve a product candidate for more limited indications than requested (such as approving AVXS-101 only for a subset of SMA Type 1 patients) or they may impose significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings or a REMS. These regulatory authorities may require precautions or contra-indications with respect to conditions of use or they may grant approval subject to the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of AVXS-101. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for AVXS-101 and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our product candidates will remain subject to regulatory oversight.\nEven if we obtain any regulatory approval for AVXS-101 or any other product candidate, it will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for such product candidate, including AVXS-101, may also be subject to a REMS, limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. For example, the holder of an approved BLA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events\nand any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the BLA. FDA guidance advises that patients treated with some types of gene therapy undergo follow-up observations for potential adverse events for as long as 15 years, and our current and each of our proposed clinical trials for AVXS-101 each include a 15 year long-term follow-up phase, limited to confirmed data collection from annual visits with standard care physicians. The holder of an approved BLA also must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements and adherence to commitments made in the BLA or foreign marketing application. If we, or a regulatory authority, discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of that product, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of AVXS-101 or other product candidate, a regulatory authority may:\n\u00b7\nissue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u00b7\nseek an injunction or impose administrative, civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve a pending BLA or comparable foreign marketing application (or any supplements thereto) submitted by us or our strategic partners;\n\u00b7\nrestrict the marketing or manufacturing of the product;\n\u00b7\nseize or detain the product or otherwise require the withdrawal of the product from the market;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to permit the import or export of product candidates; or\n\u00b7\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize AVXS-101 or other product candidates and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, the FDA\u2019s policies, and those of equivalent foreign regulatory agencies, may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of AVXS-101 or other product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully market or commercialize AVXS-101 or other product candidates.\nWe operate in highly competitive segments of the biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies as well as with new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. There are a variety of drug candidates in development for the indications that we intend to test. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product candidate development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel. We will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, registering subjects for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nNew developments, including the development of other pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may delay the initiation of future clinical trials, or otherwise change our development plans, for AVXS-101, or may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Competition in drug development is intense. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new treatments enter the market and advanced technologies become available.\nWe are aware of several companies, including Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. and G\u00e9n\u00e9thon, focused on developing gene therapies in various indications, as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Any advances in gene therapy technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against AVXS-101. In addition to a gene therapy-based solution such as AVXS-101, alternative approaches for the treatment of SMA include alternative splicing, neuroprotection and muscle enhancers. Alternative splicing seeks to achieve more efficient production of full-length SMN protein from the SMN2 gene. Companies utilizing this approach include Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which in December 2016, together with its licensee, Biogen, received FDA approval for their product SPINRAZA\u2122 (nusinersen) under Priority Review for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients and subsequently launched the product, Roche Holding Ltd, which is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial for SMA Type 1 patients and a Phase 2 trial for SMA Types 2 and 3 patients and Novartis Corporation, which is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials for SMA Type 1 patients in the EU. Neuroprotectants seek to mitigate the loss of motor neurons. Trophos SA, which has been acquired by Roche Holding Ltd, has completed its Phase 3 clinical trial of its lead neuroprotectant product candidate, Olesoxime (TRO19622), in patients between the ages of three and 25 with SMA Types 2 and 3. Cytokinetics, in collaboration with Astellas, is conducting a Phase 2 trial of their muscle enhancer CK-2127107 in SMA Types 2, 3 and 4 patients and Catalyst is conducting a Phase 2 trial of their muscle enhancer Firdapse in SMA Type 3 patients.\nMany of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidate that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly or earlier than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render AVXS-101 uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing AVXS-101 against competitors.\nIn addition, as a result of the expiration or successful challenge of our patent rights, we could face more litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our competitors\u2019 products. The availability of our\ncompetitors\u2019 products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any product candidate that we may develop and commercialize.\nEven if we obtain and maintain approval for AVXS-101 from the FDA, we may never obtain approval for AVXS-101 outside of the United States, which would limit our market opportunities and adversely affect our business.\nApproval of a product candidate in the United States by the FDA does not ensure approval of such product candidate by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Sales of AVXS-101 outside of the United States will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval. Even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries also must approve the manufacturing and marketing of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and more onerous than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. In many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our product candidates, if approved, is also subject to approval. We intend to submit a marketing authorization application to the EMA for approval of AVXS-101 in the European Union, but obtaining such approval from the European Commission following the opinion of the EMA is a lengthy and expensive process. Even if a product candidate is approved, the FDA or the European Commission, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming additional clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States and the European Union also have requirements for approval of product candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of AVXS-101 in certain countries.\nFurther, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Also, regulatory approval for AVXS-101 may be withdrawn. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of AVXS-101 will be harmed and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected.\nPreclinical testing of our gene therapy product candidates for Rett syndrome and genetic ALS may not result in our advancement of these programs into clinical trials.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our efforts to date have focused on the development of AVXS-101 for SMA, a key element of our strategy is to discover, develop and potentially commercialize a portfolio of product candidates to treat other rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases. In furtherance of that strategy, we announced that we had entered into a license agreement with REGENXBIO to develop and commercialize gene therapy treatments to treat two rare monogenic disorders: Rett syndrome and genetic ALS. Our development efforts for our Rett syndrome and ALS programs are at an extremely early stage, and we have not yet completed IND-enabling preclinical studies for either of these programs. It is possible that future research and preclinical development of these programs may not establish sufficient indications of clinical benefit or acceptable tolerability to support the submission of an IND for one or both of these programs, in which case we may never initiate clinical trials, and we may be forced to suspend development activities for one or both of these programs. If we are not able to advance these programs into clinical trials, we will not be able to commercialize products for these indications, which would have a material adverse effect on our future business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to our reliance on third parties\nA third party conducted the only clinical trial of AVXS-101 to date and sponsored this trial through November 6, 2015, and our ability to influence the design and conduct of this trial was limited. Any failure by a third party to meet its obligations with respect to the clinical and regulatory development of AVXS-101 may delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for AVXS-101 and result in liability for us.\nUntil November 6, 2015, we had not sponsored any clinical trials relating to AVXS-101. Prior to that, our third-party research institution collaborator, Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, or NCH, had sponsored our Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of SMA Type 1 relating to this product candidate, or the NCH trial, under an investigational new drug application, or IND, held by Dr. Jerry Mendell, the principal investigator at NCH. We have assumed control of the overall clinical and regulatory development of AVXS-101 for future clinical trials. Although we sponsor the clinical trial, NCH has certain reversionary rights in the case of acts or omissions constituting negligence or willful misconduct or failure to comply with applicable law. Failure to maintain sponsorship of INDs for AVXS-101 could negatively affect the timing of our potential future clinical trials. Such an impact on timing could increase research and development costs and could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for AVXS-101, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, we did not control the design or conduct of the NCH trial. It is possible that the FDA will not accept the NCH trial as part of a future registration package in support of a license application, for any of one or more reasons, including the safety, purity, and potency of the product candidate, the degree of product characterization, elements of the design or execution of the previous trials or safety concerns, or other trial results. For example, in 2016 the FDA completed an inspection of the NCH trial as conducted at NCH\u2019s facilities and made observations on an FDA Form 483. We do not believe these observations will result in our inability to rely on the data from this trial, but the FDA may disagree, which could impact our development program. We may also be subject to liabilities arising from any treatment-related injuries or adverse effects in patients enrolled in the NCH trial. As a result, we may be subject to unforeseen third-party claims and delays in our potential future clinical trials. Any such delay or liability could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we have assumed control of the overall clinical and regulatory development of AVXS-101 going forward, we have been dependent on contractual arrangements with NCH for the clinical implementation of the NCH trial. Such arrangements provide us certain information rights with respect to the NCH trial, including access to and the ability to use and reference the data, including for our own regulatory filings, resulting from the NCH trial. If these obligations are breached by NCH, or if the data prove to be inadequate compared to the first-hand knowledge we might have gained had the completed trial been a corporate-sponsored trial, then it may adversely affect or cause a delay in our development program. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with the sufficiency of our right to reference the preclinical, manufacturing, or clinical data generated by the NCH trial, or our interpretation of preclinical, manufacturing, or clinical data from the NCH trial. If so, the FDA may require us to obtain and submit additional preclinical, manufacturing, or clinical data before we may begin our planned trials and/or may not accept such additional data as adequate to begin our planned trials.\nWe may in the future enter into collaborations with third parties to develop AVXS-101 or other product candidates. If these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may potentially enter into collaborations with third parties in the future. Any collaborations we enter into in the future may pose several risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u00b7\nthe clinical trials conducted as part of these collaborations may not be successful;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for clinical trials, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7\nwe may not have access to, or may be restricted from disclosing, certain information regarding product candidates being developed or commercialized under a collaboration and, consequently, may have limited ability to inform our stockholders about the status of such product candidates;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u00b7\nproduct candidates developed in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of any such product candidate;\n\u00b7\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development of any product candidates, may cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of such product candidates, may lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to such product candidates or may result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7\ndisputes may arise with respect to the ownership of intellectual property developed pursuant to our collaborations;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u00b7\ncollaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nIf any such potential future collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates, or if one of our future collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our development of AVXS-101 or other future product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop such product candidate. In addition, if one of our future collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and the perception of us in the business and\nfinancial communities could be adversely affected. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization apply to the activities of our potential future collaborators.\nWe may in the future determine to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization of AVXS-101 or other future product candidates. These relationships, or those like them, may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we could face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Our ability to reach a definitive collaboration agreement will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of several factors. If we license rights to AVXS-101 or other future product candidates, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture.\nWe may not be successful in finding strategic collaborators for continuing development of AVXS-101 or successfully commercializing or competing in the market for certain indications.\nWe may seek to develop strategic partnerships for developing AVXS-101, due to capital costs required to develop the product candidate or manufacturing constraints. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish such a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for AVXS-101 because our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, AVXS-101 may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort or third parties may not view AVXS-101 as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. In addition, we may be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements with potential collaborators. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve an economic benefit that justifies such transaction.\nIf we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program, delay its potential commercialization, reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop AVXS-101 and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nWe previously relied on NCH and other third parties to manufacture AVXS-101 and to perform quality testing, and because we collaborate with various organizations and academic institutions for the advancement of our gene therapy platform, we must, at times, share our proprietary technology and confidential information, including trade secrets, with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our proprietary technology and confidential information or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDespite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of these agreements, independent development or publication of information including our trade secrets by third parties. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAlthough we established our own AVXS-101 manufacturing facility, we may utilize third parties as needed to conduct our product manufacturing. Therefore, we are subject to the risk that these third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nEven following the completion and validation of our cGMP manufacturing facility, which we expect will be the primary source of clinical and commercial supply for AVXS-101, we intend to evaluate potential third-party manufacturing capabilities in order to provide potential multiple sources of clinical and commercial supply. We currently utilize third-party manufacturers for the production of AVXS-201 and AVXS-301. In the event we engage third party manufacturers and they do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or manufacture AVXS-101 in accordance with regulatory requirements or if there are disagreements between us and these third-party manufacturers, we may not be able to meet commercial demand for AVXS-101 or preclinical or clinical demand for other product candidates. In such instances, we may need to locate an appropriate replacement third-party relationship, which may not be readily available or on acceptable terms, which would cause additional delay or increased expense and would thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe will need to perform analytical and other animal or cell-based tests to demonstrate that materials produced by any third-party manufacturer that we engage are safe, pure, and potent. There is no assurance that any third-party manufacturer that we engage will be successful in producing AVXS-101, that any such product will pass the required comparability testing, or that any materials produced by any third-party manufacturer that we engage will have the same effect in patients that we have observed to date with respect to materials produced by us and NCH. We believe that our own manufacturing facility will have sufficient capacity to meet demand for AVXS-101 for our future clinical trials. There is a risk that if supplies are interrupted or result in poor yield or quality, it would materially harm our business. In addition, we may change our manufacturing process for AVXS-101, which could cause delays in production as we and our third-party manufacturers seek to improve the process.\nIf the gene therapy industry were to grow, we may encounter increasing competition for the raw materials and consumables necessary for the production of AVXS-101. Furthermore, demand for third-party cGMP manufacturing facilities may grow at a faster rate than existing manufacturing capacity, which could disrupt our ability to find and retain third-party manufacturers capable of producing sufficient quantities of raw materials for AVXS-101 to meet initial commercial demand in the U.S. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on additional third parties to manufacture ingredients of AVXS-101 and to perform quality testing. Even following the establishment of our own cGMP-compliant manufacturing capabilities, we intend to maintain third-party manufacturers for these raw materials and components, which will expose us to risks including:\n\u00b7\nreduced control for certain aspects of manufacturing activities;\n\u00b7\ntermination or nonrenewal of manufacturing and service agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us; and\n\u00b7\ndisruptions to the operations of our third-party manufacturers and service providers caused by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or service provider.\nAny of these events could lead to clinical trial delays or failure to obtain regulatory approval, or impact our ability to successfully commercialize AVXS-101. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including injunction, recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of product manufacture.\nWe are subject to significant regulatory oversight with respect to manufacturing our product candidates. Our manufacturing facility may not meet regulatory requirements.\nThe preparation of therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale is subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including record keeping, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of outside agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of a product candidate that may not be detectable in final product testing. We must supply all necessary documentation in support of a BLA or other marketing authorization application on a timely basis and must adhere to the FDA\u2019s and the European Union\u2019s cGMP requirements which are enforced, in the case of the FDA, through its facilities inspection program. Our manufacturing facilities and quality systems and, to the extent that we utilize third-party facilities for commercial supply, the third party\u2019s facilities and quality systems, must pass an inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect the third-party manufacturing facility or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities do not pass a plant inspection, the EMA will not issue a positive opinion concerning the marketing authorization application and FDA approval of the product candidates will not be granted.\nIf any contract manufacturers that we engage in the future cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we will have no direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Furthermore, all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which exposes our manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may generally affect the regulatory clearance of our contract manufacturers\u2019 facility. Our failure, or the failure of our third parties, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and product candidates.\nOur potential future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nRisks related to the commercialization of AVXS-101\nGene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We have limited manufacturing experience and could experience production problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization programs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing AVXS-101. Although we have established our own manufacturing facility to support current and future clinical trials and a commercial launch, if we are unable to receive regulatory approval for our facility, we may be unable to produce clinical or commercial materials or meet demand, for AVXS-101. Any such failure could delay or prevent our development of AVXS-101 and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacturing process we use to produce AVXS-101 is complex, novel and has not been validated for commercial use. In order to produce sufficient quantities of AVXS-101 for future clinical trials and initial U.S. commercial demand, we will need to increase the scale of our manufacturing process at third-party manufacturers, as well as through continued investment into our own commercial scale manufacturing facility. We may need to change our current manufacturing process, but there are no assurances that we will be able to produce sufficient quantities of AVXS-101, due to several factors, including equipment malfunctions, facility contamination, technical process\nchallenges, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, human error or disruptions in the operations of our suppliers.\nThe production of AVXS-101 requires processing steps that are more complex than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Moreover, unlike chemical pharmaceuticals, the physical and chemical properties of a biologic such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we employ multiple steps to control our manufacturing process to assure that the process works and that AVXS-101 is made strictly and consistently in compliance with the process. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical-grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other applicable standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs.\nIn addition, the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the agency authorizes its release. Slight deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability, may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. For example, NCH, which previously manufactured AVXS-101 for us, experienced a lot failure in the past. There is no assurance we will not experience such failures at our own manufacturing facility or that of a third party in the future. Lot failures or product recalls could cause us to delay product launches or clinical trials, which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced specialist scientific, quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing process, which could result in delays in our production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nAny problems in our manufacturing process or facilities could make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs. Problems in our manufacturing process or facilities also could restrict our ability to meet market demand for AVXS-101 or future product candidates.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, medical affairs and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell AVXS-101, we may be unable to generate any product revenue.\nTo successfully commercialize any product candidate that may result from our development programs, we will need to develop sales and marketing capabilities, either on our own or with others. The continued establishment and development of our own commercial team or the establishment of a contract sales force to market any product candidate we may develop will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop this capability. We may enter into collaborations regarding AVXS-101 with other entities to utilize their established marketing and distribution capabilities, but we may be unable to enter into such agreements on favorable terms, if at all. If any future collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our product candidates, or we are unable to develop the necessary capabilities on our own, we will be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain our business. We compete with many companies that currently have extensive, experienced and well-funded medical affairs, marketing and sales operations to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of AVXS-101. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nOur efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of AVXS-101 may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts may require more resources than are typically required due to the complexity and uniqueness of our potential product candidate. If AVXS-101 is approved but fails to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients or third-party payors, we will not be able to generate significant revenues\nfrom such product, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf the market opportunities for AVXS-101 are smaller than we believe they are, our product revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe currently focus our research and product development on treatments for SMA, a severe genetic and orphan disease. Our understanding of both the number of people who have this disease, as well as the subset of people with this disease who have the potential to benefit from treatment with AVXS-101, are based on estimates in published literature and by SMA foundations. These estimates may prove to be incorrect and new studies may reduce the estimated incidence or prevalence of this disease. The number of patients in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our product candidate or patients may become increasingly difficult to identify and access, all of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFurther, there are several factors that could contribute to making the actual number of patients who receive our potential product candidate less than the potentially addressable market. These include the lack of widespread availability of, and limited reimbursement for, new therapies in many underdeveloped markets. Further, the severity of the progression of a disease up to the time of treatment, especially in certain degenerative conditions such as SMA, will likely diminish the therapeutic benefit conferred by a gene therapy due to irreversible cell damage. Lastly, certain patients\u2019 immune systems might prohibit the successful delivery of certain gene therapy products to the target tissue, thereby limiting the treatment outcomes.\nThe commercial success of AVXS-101 will depend upon its degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.\nEthical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting AVXS-101. Even with the requisite approvals from the FDA in the United States, the EMA in the European Union and other regulatory authorities internationally, the commercial success of AVXS-101 will depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients and health care payors of gene therapy products in general, and AVXS-101 in particular, as medically necessary, cost-effective and safe. Any product that we commercialize may not gain acceptance by physicians, patients, health care payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of gene therapy products and, in particular, AVXS-101, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy and safety of AVXS-101 as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy, potential and perceived advantages of AVXS-101 over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of treatment relative to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe clinical indications for which AVXS-101 is approved by the FDA or the European Commission;\n\u00b7\npatient awareness of, and willingness to seek, genotyping;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of physicians to prescribe new therapies;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u00b7\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u00b7\nthe approval of genetic screening for SMA in newborns by applicable federal and state regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of products and their ability to meet market demand;\n\u00b7\npublicity concerning our product candidate(s) or competing products and treatments;\n\u00b7\nany restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications; and\n\u00b7\nfavorable third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be fully known until after it is launched.\nDelays in obtaining regulatory approval of our manufacturing process and facility or disruptions in our manufacturing process may delay or disrupt our product development and commercialization efforts. To date, to our knowledge, there are limited cGMP gene therapy manufacturing facilities in the United States that have been licensed by the FDA for the manufacture of an approved gene therapy product.\nBefore we can begin to commercially manufacture AVXS-101, whether in our own facility or a third-party facility, we must obtain regulatory approval from FDA for our manufacturing process and facility. A manufacturing authorization must also be obtained from the appropriate European Union regulatory authorities. To date, there are limited cGMP gene therapy manufacturing facilities in the United States that have received approval from the FDA for the manufacture of an approved gene therapy product and, therefore, the timeframe required for us to obtain such approval is uncertain. In addition, we must pass a pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing facility by the FDA before AVXS-101 can obtain marketing approval. In order to obtain approval, we will need to ensure that all of our processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP, and perform extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. If any of our vendors, contract laboratories or suppliers is found to be out of compliance with cGMP, we may experience delays or disruptions in manufacturing while we work with these third parties to remedy the violation or while we work to identify suitable replacement vendors. The cGMP requirements govern quality control of the manufacturing process and documentation policies and procedures. In complying with cGMP, we will be obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may not be permitted to sell any product candidate that we may develop.\nOur gene therapy approach utilizes a vector derived from viruses, which may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events. Negative public opinion and increased regulatory and media scrutiny of gene therapy may damage public perception of the safety of our AVXS-101 gene therapy product candidate and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for AVXS-101.\nGene therapy remains a novel technology, with, to our knowledge, only a limited number of gene therapy products approved to date in the United States and the European Union. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. For example, a public backlash developed against gene therapy following the death in September 1999 of a patient who had\nvolunteered for a gene therapy clinical trial that utilized an adenovirus vector at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Researchers at the university had infused the volunteer\u2019s liver with a gene aimed at reversing OTC deficiency. The procedure triggered an extreme immune-system reaction that caused multiple organ failure in a very short time, leading to the first death to occur as a direct result of a gene therapy experiment. In addition, in two gene therapy studies in 2003, 20 subjects treated for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency using a murine gamma-retroviral vector showed correction of the disease. However, the studies were suspended by FDA after a child in France developed leukemia and ultimately four other subjects were found to have developed leukemia.\nIn addition, our success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of SMA and prescribing treatments that involve the use of AVXS-101 in lieu of, or in addition to, other treatments with which they are more familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of AVXS-101 or demand for any product candidate we may develop. Serious adverse events in our clinical trials, or other clinical trials involving gene therapy products or our competitors\u2019 products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of AVXS-101, stricter labeling requirements for AVXS-101 that are approved and a decrease in demand for AVXS-101.\nFailure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements could cause us to suspend production or put in place costly or time-consuming remedial measures.\nThe regulatory authorities may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, initiate an inspection of the manufacturing facilities for such product. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations, or if a violation of product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly or time-consuming to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a manufacturing facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon our third-party manufacturer or us could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturer fails to comply with applicable cGMP regulations, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new product candidate or suspension or revocation of a pre-existing approval. Such an occurrence may cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects to be materially harmed.\nAdditionally, if supply from a manufacturing facility is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply of AVXS-101. Although we are evaluating potential third parties and additional internal sources of redundant manufacturing capacity, we do not currently have a backup manufacturer for AVXS-101 supply for clinical trials, and have not selected a manufacturer or backup manufacturer for AVXS-101 supply for commercial sale. An alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified, through a supplement to its regulatory filing, which could result in further delay. The regulatory authorities also may require additional trials if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturers may involve substantial costs and could result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines.\nAny contamination in our manufacturing process, shortages of raw materials or failure of any of our key suppliers to deliver necessary components could result in delays in our clinical development or marketing schedules.\nGiven the nature of biologics manufacturing, there is a risk of contamination. Any contamination could materially adversely affect our ability to produce AVXS-101 on schedule and could, therefore, harm our results of operations and cause reputational damage.\nSome of the raw materials required in our manufacturing process are derived from biologic sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may be subject to contamination or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall or restriction on the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of AVXS-101 could adversely\nimpact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing or the production of clinical material, which could materially and adversely affect our development timelines and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly-approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our product candidate(s), if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate product revenue.\nWe expect the cost of a single administration of gene therapy products, such as those we are developing, to be substantial, when and if they achieve regulatory approval. We expect that coverage and reimbursement by government and private payors will be essential for most patients to be able to afford these treatments. Accordingly, sales of AVXS-101 will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of AVXS-101 will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or will be reimbursed by government authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon several factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u00b7\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u00b7\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u00b7\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7\ncost-effective; and\n\u00b7\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement for a product from third-party payors is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to the payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize AVXS-101. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be adequate to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, third-party payors, including government payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered and reimbursed. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or the CMS, is the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program. It is difficult to predict what the CMS will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and few precedents for these types of products. Moreover, reimbursement agencies in the European Union may be more conservative than the CMS. For example, several cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the United States and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain European Union Member States. It is difficult to predict what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for AVXS-101.\nOutside the United States, international operations generally are subject to extensive government price controls and other market regulations, and increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in the European Union, Canada and other countries may put pricing pressure on us. For example, it was announced in 2017 that the marketing authorization in Europe for one gene therapy product approved in the European Union in 2012 would not be renewed because patient usage was extremely limited. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are\nsubstantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to set their own prices for medical products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidate. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our product candidate may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable product revenues.\nAdditionally, in countries where the pricing of gene therapy products is subject to governmental control, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by government and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for AVXS-101. Payors increasingly are considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price, and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on some of these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates, and the CMS has begun making pharmacy National Average Drug Acquisition Cost and National Average Retail Price data publicly available on at least a monthly basis. Therefore, it may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement metrics on the willingness of payors to cover AVXS-101 if we or our partners are ultimately able to commercialize it. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of AVXS-101 due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products such as ours.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize AVXS-101 outside of the United States, in particular in the European Union, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe expect that we will be subject to additional risks in commercializing AVXS-101 outside the United States, including:\n\u00b7\ndifferent regulatory requirements for approval of drugs and biologics in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe existence of additional third party patent rights of potential relevance to our business;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7\nforeign reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;\n\u00b7\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u00b7\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nInterruptions in the supply of product or inventory loss may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAVXS-101 is manufactured using technically complex processes requiring specialized facilities, highly specific raw materials and other production constraints. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict government standards for the manufacture and storage of AVXS-101 subjects us to production risks. While product batches released for use in clinical trials or, in the future, for commercialization undergo sample testing, some defects may only be identified following product release. In addition, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved process changes may result in these intermediate product candidates not complying with stability requirements or specifications. AVXS-101 must be stored and transported at temperatures within a certain range. If these environmental conditions deviate, AVXS-101\u2019s remaining shelf-life could be impaired or its efficacy and safety could be adversely affected, making it no longer suitable for use.\nThe occurrence, or suspected occurrence, of production and distribution difficulties can lead to lost inventories and, in some cases, product recalls, with consequential reputational damage and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause production delays, substantial expense, lost sales and delays of new product launches. Any interruption in the supply of finished AVXS-101 or the loss thereof could hinder our ability to timely distribute AVXS-101 and satisfy customer demand. Any unforeseen failure in the storage of the product or loss in supply could delay our clinical trials and, if AVXS-101 is approved, result in a loss of our market share and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf AVXS-101 becomes subject to a product recall it could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design, manufacture or labeling. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the product would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our product candidate in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a product is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our product candidate would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our product candidate in the future that we determine do not require notification to the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, we could be required to report those actions as recalls. A recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nRisks related to our business operations\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our efforts will focus on our ongoing clinical trials and potential approval of AVXS-101, a key element of our strategy is to discover, develop and potentially commercialize a portfolio of product candidates to treat rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases, including Rett syndrome and genetic ALS, for which we are conducting preclinical studies. We intend to do so by exploring strategic partnerships for the development of new products and in-licensing technologies leading to the development of new product candidates. Identifying new product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Even if we identify product candidates that initially show promise, we may fail to successfully develop and commercialize such product candidates for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u00b7\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete;\n\u00b7\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights that we are unable to license;\n\u00b7\na product candidate may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u00b7\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u00b7\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors.\nIf we are unsuccessful in identifying and developing additional product candidates, our potential for growth may be impaired.\nWe may fail to capitalize on other potential product candidates that may be a greater commercial opportunity or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to develop and commercialize AVXS-101. AVXS-101 may be shown to have harmful side effects, may be commercially impracticable to manufacture or may have other characteristics that may make the product unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval.\nAdditionally, because we have limited resources, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or product candidates or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our spending on current and future research and development programs may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. Alternatively, we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts with respect to a particular product candidate or fail to develop a potentially successful product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on members of our executive team, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. While we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers, any of them could leave our employment at any time. We currently do not have \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our employees. The loss of the services of one or more of our current employees might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, also will be critical to our success. There currently is a shortage of skilled individuals with substantial gene therapy experience, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel, including in gene therapy research and vector manufacturing, is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in preclinical or clinical trials or applications for marketing approval may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit, or loss of services of certain executives, key employees, consultants or advisors, may impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we are unable to build and integrate our management team, our business could be harmed.\nOur success depends largely on the development and execution of our business strategy by our senior management team. Dr. Kaspar was historically employed as our Chief Scientific Officer on a part-time basis, while he devoted a majority of his professional time to his responsibilities at NCH. Effective September 2017, Dr. Kaspar began serving as our Chief Scientific Officer on a full-time basis. Under the terms of his former NCH employment agreement, NCH owns all inventions and discoveries, whether patentable or not, that Dr. Kaspar made, conceived or reduced to practice while at NCH, unless otherwise specifically provided for by the terms of a sponsored research agreement between NCH and us.\nWe cannot assure you that our new management will succeed in working together as a team, working well with our other existing employees or successfully executing our business strategy in the near-term or at all, which could harm our business and financial prospects. Further, integrating new management into existing operations may be challenging. If we are unable to effectively integrate our new executive management team, our operations and prospects could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to manage expected growth in the scale and complexity of our operations, our performance may suffer.\nIf we are successful in executing our business strategy, we will need to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other systems and resources to manage our operations, continue our research and development activities and, in the longer term, build a commercial infrastructure to support commercialization of AVXS-101 if it is approved for sale. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. It is likely that our management, finance, development personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and any future product candidates requires that we continue to develop more robust business processes and improve our systems and procedures in each of these areas and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees. We may be unable to successfully implement these tasks on a larger scale and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and growth goals.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations\nor the regulations applicable in the European Union and other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA, the European Commission and other regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nFor example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the PPACA, was passed, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA, among other things: (i) addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; (ii) increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (iii) establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs; (iv) expands the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; and (v) establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% commencing on January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.\nSome of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal or repeal and replace other elements of the PPACA We continue to evaluate the possible impact of the PPACA, as amended, and the possible repeal and/or replacement of the PPACA on our business.\nAdditionally, in the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biologic products that are demonstrated to be \u201chighly similar\u201d or \u201cbiosimilar or interchangeable\u201d with an FDA-approved biologic product. This pathway allows competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved after 12 years from the time of approval. This could expose us to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars even if we commercialize a product candidate faster than our competitors. Moreover, this abbreviated approval pathway does not preclude or delay a third party from pursuing approval of a competitive product candidate via the traditional approval pathway based on their own clinical trial data. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.\nAdditionally, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nWe expect that these initiatives, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms could result in reduced demand for AVXS-101 or additional pricing pressures, and may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nOur relationships with customers, physicians, and third-party payors will be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur operations may be directly, or indirectly through our prescribers, customers and purchasers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil and criminal laws and Physician Payments Sunshine Act and regulations. These laws will impact, among other things, our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. In addition, we\nmay be subject to patient privacy laws by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for the purchase, recommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The PPACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it;\n\u00b7\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that are false or fraudulent. The PPACA provides and recent government cases against pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers support the view that federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may implicate the federal civil False Claims Act;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or from making false or fraudulent statements to defraud any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private);\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, and as amended again by the final HIPAA omnibus rule, Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules Under HITECH and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act; Other Modifications to HIPAA, published in January 2013, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to HIPAA, such as health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers, and their respective business associates that access protected health information;\n\u00b7\nfederal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, that require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to: (i) payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians and teaching hospitals and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u00b7\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts in certain circumstances, such as specific disease states; and\n\u00b7\nState and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, individual imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if a person becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any product candidate that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the clinical testing of AVXS-101 and any future product candidates in clinical trials and may face an even greater risk if we commercialize any product candidate that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for any product candidate that we may develop;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nsignificant time and costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize any product candidate(s) that we may develop; and\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance coverage, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage each time we commence a clinical trial and if we successfully commercialize any product candidate. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, manufacture, transportation and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biologic\nmaterials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property, casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance for certain costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biologic, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which have tended to become more stringent over time. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThird parties on which we rely and we may be adversely affected by natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nNatural disasters could severely disrupt our operations or the operations of manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as manufacturing facilities, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and may not prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and any future collaborators and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we are not aware of any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of AVXS-101 could be delayed.\nThe recently enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The newly enacted federal income tax law, contains significant changes to corporate taxation including, among other things, reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense (except for certain small businesses), limitation of\nthe deduction for future net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits, including the Orphan Drug credit. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge prospective investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nOur rights to develop and commercialize AVXS-101 and our preclinical programs for Rett syndrome and genetic ALS are subject to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others.\nWe do not currently own any patents or patent applications and we are heavily reliant upon licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of our technology and product candidate(s), including technology related to our manufacturing process and AVXS-101. These and other licenses may not provide exclusive rights to use such intellectual property and technology, at all, or in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and product candidate(s) in the future. As a result, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and commercializing competitive products, including in territories included in all of our licenses. Our licenses are limited by field.\nLicenses to additional third-party technology and materials that may be required for our development programs, including additional technology and materials owned by NCH or any of our current licensors, may not be available in the future or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents covering technology that we license from third parties. For example, pursuant to each of our intellectual property licenses with NCH and REGENXBIO Inc., or REGENXBIO, our licensors retain control of such activities. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted, maintained and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents or patent applications, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated and our right to develop and commercialize any of our product candidate(s) that are the subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected. In addition to the foregoing, the risks associated with patent rights that we license from third parties will also apply to patent rights we may own in the future.\nThe research resulting in certain of our licensed patent rights and technology, including that licensed from REGENXBIO and NCH, was funded in part by the U.S. government. As a result, the government may have certain rights, including march-in rights, to such patent rights and technology. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for government purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise march-in rights to use or allow third parties to use our licensed technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture product candidate(s) embodying such inventions in the United States. Any exercise by the government of such rights could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our current product candidate, any future product candidates we may develop and our technology, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our current product candidate, any future product candidates we may develop and our technology may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to seek, obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to AVXS-101 and to future innovation related to our manufacturing technology. Our licensors have sought and we intend to seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and, in some cases, abroad related to certain technologies and AVXS-101 that are important to our business. Our current patent portfolio contains a limited number of patents and applications, all of the patents and patent applications currently in our patent portfolio are in-licensed from third parties and all of the exclusively licensed patents and patent applications in our patent portfolio are limited to compositions and methods that use an AAV9 capsid. However, the risks associated with patent rights generally apply to patent rights that we in-license now or in the future, as well as patent rights that we may own in the future. Moreover, the risks apply with respect to patent rights and other intellectual property applicable to AVXS-101, as well as to any intellectual property rights that we may acquire in the future related to future product candidates, if any.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. For example, one of the patent application families licensed to us related to AVXS-101 was filed in the United States only. As a result, we will not have the opportunity to obtain patent protection for the inventions disclosed in that patent application family outside the United States. In addition, certain patents in the field of gene therapy that may have otherwise potentially provided patent protection for our product candidate will soon expire.\nWe believe our in-licensed patent portfolio includes claims that, if issued, would cover our AVXS-101 product candidate. Should a pending application containing such claims issue as a patent, such patent would expire in 2029 in the United States. However, claims covering AVXS-101 may never issue from this pending application. Additionally, there are no foreign counterpart patents or applications, and thus, comparable protection will not be available outside the United States. Our patent applications are at an early stage and there is no assurance that patents will issue from such applications.\nIn some cases, the work of certain academic researchers in the gene therapy field has entered the public domain, which we believe precludes our ability to obtain patent protection for certain inventions relating to such work. Consequently, we will not be able to assert any such patents to prevent others from using our technology for, and developing and marketing competing products to treat, these indications. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nWe are a party to intellectual property license agreements with NCH, REGENXBIO and AskBio, each of which is important to our business, and we expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, development and commercialization timelines, milestone payments, royalties and other obligations on us. See \u201cBusiness-Our Collaboration and License Agreements.\u201d If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, or, in some cases, under other circumstances, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market product candidate(s) covered by the license. In addition, certain of these license agreements are not assignable by us without the consent of the respective licensor, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to engage in certain transactions.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has, in recent years, been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our licensed patent rights and future patent applications that we may own or license may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or product candidate(s), effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and product candidates or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. In fact, patent applications may\nnot issue as patents at all. Even assuming patents issue from patent applications in which we have rights, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nOther parties have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our own and such parties may have filed or may file patent applications, or may have received or may receive patents, claiming inventions that may overlap or conflict with those claimed in our own patent applications or issued patents. We may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to AVXS-101 or any future product candidates. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and in other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or, in some cases, not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether the inventors of our licensed patents and applications were the first to make the inventions claimed in those patents or pending patent applications, or that they were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Similarly, should we own any patents or patent applications in the future, we may not be certain that we were the first to file for patent protection for the inventions claimed in such patents or patent applications. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity and commercial value of our patent rights cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nEven if the patent applications we license or may own in the future do issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Even if issued, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and product candidate(s). Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nThe degree of patent protection we require to successfully compete in the marketplace may be unavailable or severely limited in some cases and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. We cannot provide any assurances that any of our licensed patents have, or that any of our pending licensed patent applications that mature into issued patents will include, claims with a scope sufficient to protect AVXS-101 or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Furthermore, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with adequate and continuing patent protection sufficient to exclude others from commercializing products similar to our product candidates, including biosimilar versions of such products. In addition, the patent portfolio licensed to us by REGENXBIO may be used by REGENXBIO or licensed to third parties outside our field, and such third parties may have certain enforcement rights. Thus, patents licensed to us could be put at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly in litigation filed by or against REGENXBIO or another licensee or in administrative proceedings brought by or against REGENXBIO or another licensee in response to such litigation or for other reasons.\nEven if we acquire patent protection that we expect should enable us to maintain some competitive advantage, third parties, including competitors, may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. In litigation, a competitor could claim that our patents, if issued, are not valid for a number of reasons. If a court agrees, we would lose our rights to those challenged patents.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability and our licensed patents may be challenged in courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. For example, we may be subject to a third-party submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, challenging the\nvalidity of one or more claims of our licensed patents. Such submissions may also be made prior to a patent\u2019s issuance, precluding the granting of a patent based on one of our pending licensed patent applications. We may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging the patent rights of others from whom we have obtained licenses to such rights. Competitors may claim that they invented the inventions claimed in our issued patents or patent applications prior to the inventors of our licensed patents, or may have filed patent applications before the University of Pennsylvania, as owner of the patent rights licensed by us from REGENXBIO, or NCH did. A competitor who can establish an earlier filing or invention date may also claim that we are infringing their patents and that we therefore cannot practice our technology as claimed under our licensed patents, if issued. Competitors may also contest our licensed patents, if issued, by showing that the invention was not patent-eligible, was not novel, was obvious or that the patent claims failed any other requirement for patentability.\nIn addition, the University of Pennsylvania or NCH may in the future be subject to claims by former employees or consultants asserting an ownership right in our licensed patents or patent applications, as a result of the work they performed. An adverse determination in any such submission or proceeding may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar technology and therapeutics, without payment to us, or could limit the duration of the patent protection covering our technology and product candidates. Such challenges may also result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize our product candidates without infringing third party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nEven if they are unchallenged, our licensed patents and pending patent applications, if issued, may not provide us with any meaningful protection or prevent competitors from designing around our patent claims to circumvent our licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or therapeutics in a non-infringing manner. For example, a third party may develop a competitive therapeutic that provides benefits similar to one or more of our product candidates but that uses a vector or an expression construct that falls outside the scope of our patent protection. If the patent protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to our product candidates is not sufficiently broad to impede such competition, our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates could be negatively affected, which would harm our business.\nOur intellectual property licenses with third parties may be subject to disagreements over contract interpretation, which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase our financial or other obligations to our licensors.\nWe currently depend, and will continue to depend, on our license agreements, including our agreements with NCH and our agreements with REGENXBIO and AskBio, whereby we obtain rights in certain patents and patent applications owned by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of North Carolina, respectively. Further development and commercialization of AVXS-101 may and development of any future product candidates will require us to enter into additional license or collaboration agreements, including, potentially, additional agreements with NCH or any of our other licensors. The agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf any of our licenses or material relationships or any in-licenses upon which our licenses are based including the underlying agreements between REGENXBIO and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, and AskBio and the University of North Carolina, are terminated or breached, we may:\n\u00b7\nlose our rights to develop and market AVXS-101;\n\u00b7\nlose patent protection for AVXS-101;\n\u00b7\nexperience significant delays in the development or commercialization of AVXS-101;\n\u00b7\nnot be able to obtain any other licenses on acceptable terms, if at all; or\n\u00b7\nincur liability for damages.\nIn addition, as described in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, Sophia\u2019s Cure Foundation, or SCF, has filed a complaint alleging that our performance under our license agreement with NCH, including our sponsorship of the IND and clinical trial for AVXS-101, interferes with SCF\u2019s rights under a donation agreement that SCF entered into with NCH in 2012. If this claim is successful, it may adversely affect our rights and ability to advance AVXS-101 as a clinical candidate or subject us to liability for monetary damages, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThese risks apply to any agreements that we may enter into in the future for AVXS-101 or for any future product candidates. If we experience any of the foregoing, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results or operations and prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe have entered into license agreements with third parties and may need to obtain additional licenses from one or more of these same third parties or from others to advance our research or allow commercialization of AVXS-101. It is possible that we may be unable to obtain additional licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign AVXS-101 or the methods for manufacturing it or to develop or license replacement technology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize AVXS-101, which would harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents or other intellectual property rights do not exist which might be enforced against our current manufacturing methods, product candidate or future methods, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our manufacture or sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nIn each of our existing license agreements, and we expect in our future agreements, patent prosecution of our licensed technology is controlled solely by the licensor, and we may be required to reimburse the licensor for their costs of patent prosecution. If our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property we license from them, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, and our competitors could market competing products using the intellectual property. Further, in each of our license agreements our licensors have the first right to bring any actions against any third party for infringing on the patents we have licensed. Our license agreements also require us to meet development thresholds to maintain the license, including establishing a set timeline for developing and commercializing product candidate(s). Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u00b7\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u00b7\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\u00b7\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u00b7\nthe inventorship or ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n\u00b7\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize AVXS-101.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining necessary rights to AVXS-101 through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe currently have certain rights to the intellectual property, through licenses from third parties, to develop AVXS-101. Because our programs may require the use of additional proprietary rights held by these or other third parties, the growth of our business likely will depend, in part, on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for AVXS-101. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment.\nWe may collaborate with non-profit and academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. These institutions may provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program.\nOur Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Brian Kaspar, was a faculty member at NCH. NCH owns inventions and discoveries, whether patentable or not, that Dr. Kaspar made, conceived or reduced to practice while he was an employee of NCH, unless otherwise specifically provided for by the terms of a sponsored research agreement between us and NCH. If we are unable to secure sufficient rights in intellectual property made by Dr. Kaspar, our business, including the ability to pursue development and commercialization of AVXS-101, may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of AVXS-101 and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer. Moreover, to the extent that we seek to develop other product candidates in the future, we will likely require acquisition or in-license of additional proprietary rights held by third parties.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO, and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our licensed patents and/or applications and any patent rights we may own in the future. We rely on our outside counsel or our licensing partners to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government patent agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply and we are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed intellectual property. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance\ncan result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSome intellectual property which we have in-licensed may have been discovered through government funded programs and thus may be subject to federal regulations such as \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights, certain reporting requirements, and a preference for U.S. industry. Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights, and limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers.\nSome of the intellectual property rights we have licensed, including rights owned by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and licensed from REGENXBIO, and rights licensed from NCH, may have been generated through the use of U.S. government funding and may therefore be subject to certain federal regulations. As a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future product candidates pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, or Bayh-Dole Act. These U.S. government rights in certain inventions developed under a government-funded program include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d). The U.S. government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we, or the applicable licensor, fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. Intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us or the applicable licensor to expend substantial resources. In addition, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention be manufactured substantially in the United States. The manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for U.S. manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property. To the extent any of our current or future intellectual property is generated through the use of U.S. government funding, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply. Any exercise by the government of certain of its rights could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidate(s) in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States could be less extensive than those in the United States. Although our license agreements with NCH and REGENXBIO grant us worldwide rights, certain of our in-licensed U.S. patent rights related to intravenous delivery of AVXS-101 lack corresponding foreign patents or patent applications, and in the case of NCH, the patent application families licensed to us related to the intravenous delivery of AVXS-101, which were filed in the United States only. Thus, in some cases, we will not have the opportunity to obtain patent protection for certain licensed technology outside the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States even in jurisdictions where we do pursue patent protection. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, even in jurisdictions where we do pursue patent protection or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not pursued and obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidate(s) and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if pursued and obtained, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIssued patents covering AVXS-101 could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court. We may not be able to protect our trade secrets in court.\nIf one of our licensing partners or we initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering AVXS-101, assuming such a patent has or does issue, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid or unenforceable. Presently, although patents licensed from REGENXBIO have issued, none of the patent applications licensed to us from NCH have issued as patents. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, written description, non-enablement or failure to claim patent eligible subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld information material to patentability from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties also may raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, inter partes review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Such proceedings could result in the revocation or cancellation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover AVXS-101. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which the patent examiner and we or our licensing partners were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we could lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on AVXS-101. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of AVXS-101 discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. However, we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical know-how or other trade secrets by the parties to these agreements, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. If any of the collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants who are parties to these agreements breaches or violates the terms of any of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation. As a result, we could lose our trade secrets.\nWe cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures, they may still be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.\nIn addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Competitors could purchase our product candidates and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If our trade secrets are not adequately protected so as to protect our market against competitors\u2019 therapeutics, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell AVXS-101 and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive and complex litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. We may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to AVXS-101 and technology, including interference proceedings, post grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO. Our competitors or other third parties may assert infringement claims against us, alleging that our therapeutics, manufacturing methods, formulations or administration methods are covered by their patents. Given the vast number of patents in our field of technology, we cannot be certain or guarantee that we do not infringe existing patents or that we will not infringe patents that may be granted in the future. Many companies and institutions have filed, and continue to file, patent applications related to gene therapy and related manufacturing methods. Some of these patent applications have already been allowed or issued and others may issue in the future. Since this area is competitive and of strong interest to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, there will likely be additional patent applications filed and additional patents granted in the future, as well as additional research and development programs expected in the future. Furthermore, because patent applications can take many years to issue, may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing and can be revised before issuance, there may be applications now pending which may later result in issued patents that may be infringed by the manufacture, use, sale or importation of our product candidates and we may or may not be aware of such patents. If a patent holder believes the manufacture, use, sale or importation of one of our therapeutics infringes its patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have licensed other patent protection for our technology. Moreover, we may face patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our licensed patent portfolio may therefore have no deterrent effect.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Moreover, it is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify all third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our product candidates and technologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. We may fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent applications of potential interest but incorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims of relevance to our technology. In addition, we may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of a current or future product candidate, or we may incorrectly conclude that a third-party patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by our activities. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, AVXS-101 or the use of AXVS-101.\nThird parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit. There is a risk that third parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent or other intellectual property rights against us. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to commercialize AVXS-101. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S.\npatent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. Similarly, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would find that AVXS-101 or our technology did not infringe a third-party patent.\nPatent and other types of intellectual property litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and their outcome is uncertain. If we are found, or believe there is a risk that we may be found, to infringe a third party\u2019s valid and enforceable intellectual property rights, we could be required or may choose to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing our product candidate(s) and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology or product candidate, including AVXS-101. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing AVXS-101 or force us to cease some or all of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nLitigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable and generally expensive and time-consuming. Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensing partners, should such patents issue or we may be required to defend against claims of infringement. To counter infringement or unauthorized use claims or to defend against claims of infringement can be expensive and time consuming. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.\nWe may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating or successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nCertain of our employees, consultants or advisors are currently, or were previously, employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, as well as our academic partners. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. An\ninability to incorporate such technologies or features would have a material adverse effect on our business and may prevent us from successfully commercializing our product candidates. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel as a result of such claims. Moreover, any such litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent contractors. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. For example, our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Brian Kaspar, was a faculty member at NCH. NCH owns inventions and discoveries, whether patentable or not, made, conceived or reduced to practice by him while he was an employee of NCH, unless otherwise specifically provided for by the terms of a sponsored research agreement between NCH and us. Moreover, even when we obtain agreements assigning intellectual property to us, the assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Moreover, individuals executing agreements with us may have preexisting or competing obligations to a third party, such as an academic institution, and thus an agreement with us may be ineffective in perfecting ownership of inventions developed by that individual. Disputes about the ownership of intellectual property that we may own may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidate(s).\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes several significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These also include provisions that switched the United States from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, allow third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and set forth additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent through various post grant proceedings administered by the USPTO. Under a first-to-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The USPTO developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe patent positions of companies engaged in the development and commercialization of biologics and pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. Two cases involving diagnostic method claims and \u201cgene patents\u201d have been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, or the Supreme Court. On March 20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., or Prometheus, a case involving patent claims directed to a process of measuring a metabolic product in a patient to optimize a drug dosage for the patient. According to the Supreme Court, the addition of well-understood, routine or conventional activity such as \u201cadministering\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d steps was not enough to transform an otherwise patent-ineligible natural phenomenon into patent-eligible subject matter. On July 3, 2012, the USPTO issued a guidance memo to patent examiners indicating that process claims directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon or a naturally occurring relation or correlation that do not include additional elements or steps that integrate the natural principle into the claimed invention such that the natural principle is practically applied and the claim amounts to significantly more than the natural principle itself should be rejected as directed to patent-ineligible subject matter. On June 13, 2013, the Supreme Court issued its decision in\nAssociation for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., or Myriad, a case involving patent claims held by Myriad Genetics, Inc. relating to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Myriad held that an isolated segment of naturally occurring DNA, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is not patent eligible subject matter, but that complementary DNA may be patent eligible.\nThe USPTO issued a guidance memorandum to patent examiners entitled 2014 Procedure For Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis Of Claims Reciting Or Involving Laws Of Nature/Natural Principles, Natural Phenomena, And/Or Natural Products. These guidelines instruct USPTO examiners on the ramifications of the Prometheus and Myriad rulings and apply the Myriad ruling to natural products and principles including all naturally occurring nucleic acids. Certain claims of our licensed patents and patent applications contain claims that relate to specific recombinant DNA sequences that are naturally occurring at least in part and, therefore, could be the subject of future challenges made by third parties. In addition, the recent USPTO guidance could impact our ability to pursue similar patent claims in patent applications we may prosecute in the future.\nWe cannot assure you that our efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and product candidate(s) will not be negatively impacted by the decisions described above, rulings in other cases or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO. We cannot fully predict what impact the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Prometheus and Myriad may have on the ability of life science companies to obtain or enforce patents relating to their products and technologies in the future. These decisions, the guidance issued by the USPTO and rulings in other cases or changes in USPTO guidance or procedures could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nMoreover, although the Supreme Court held in Myriad that isolated segments of naturally occurring DNA are not patent-eligible subject matter, certain third parties could allege that activities that we may undertake infringe other gene-related patent claims, and we may deem it necessary to defend ourselves against these claims by asserting non-infringement and/or invalidity positions, or paying to obtain a license to these claims. In any of the foregoing or in other situations involving third-party intellectual property rights, if we are unsuccessful in defending against claims of patent infringement, we could be forced to pay damages or be subjected to an injunction that would prevent us from utilizing the patented subject matter. Such outcomes could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension for AVXS-101, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of AVXS-101, one or more U.S. patents that we license or may own in the future may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process based on the first regulatory approval for a particular drug or biologic. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. In addition, to the extent we wish to pursue patent term extension based on a patent that we in-license from a third party, we would need the cooperation of that third party. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may be able to enter the market sooner, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have registered trademark applications with the USPTO for the mark and logo \u201cAveXis.\u201d We also have a pending trademark application with the USPTO for the mark \u201cAVXS-101,\u201d approval of which is not guaranteed. Once\nregistered, our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nIntellectual property rights and regulatory exclusivity rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u00b7\nothers may be able to make gene therapy products that are similar to our product candidate(s) but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we license or may own in the future;\n\u00b7\nwe, or our license partners or future collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent applications that we license or may own in the future;\n\u00b7\nwe, or our license partners or future collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our owned or licensed intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nothers may circumvent our regulatory exclusivities, such as by pursuing approval of a competitive product candidate via the traditional approval pathway based on their own clinical data, rather than relying on the abbreviated pathway provided for biosimilar applicants;\n\u00b7\nit is possible that our pending licensed patent applications or those that we may own in the future will not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7\nissued patents that we hold rights to now or in the future may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nothers may have access to the same intellectual property rights licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis;\n\u00b7\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u00b7\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7\nthe patents or other intellectual property rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and\n\u00b7\nwe may choose not to file a patent for certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders will maintain the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nAs of February 26, 2018, our executive officers and directors and their respective affiliates beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 11.7% of our common stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to act together, they would be able to exert significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they act together, would likely be able to exert significant influence over the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire or result in management of our company that our public stockholders disagree with.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely, in part, on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for holders of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile. Since our initial public offering in February 2016, the intraday price of our common stock has fluctuated from a low of $16.11 to a high of $128.00. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price that you paid for it. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidate or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7\ncommencement or termination of collaborations;\n\u00b7\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nour manufacturing capabilities and strategy, including the scalability and commercial viability of our manufacturing methods and processes;\n\u00b7\nour inability to obtain or delays in obtaining adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u00b7\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u00b7\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation often has been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks.\nWe may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic partnerships, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, intellectual property rights, technologies, or businesses. Any potential acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\nincreased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\n\u00b7\nassimilation of operations, intellectual property and products of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing product programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition;\n\u00b7\nretention of key employees, the loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\n\u00b7\nrisks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and regulatory approvals; and\n\u00b7\nour inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nIn addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense. Moreover, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or AVXS-101.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships, and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or AVXS-101, or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, and particularly now that we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nPursuant to Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports. Additionally, because we ceased to qualify as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2017, we also must include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404, we have engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we have dedicated internal resources, engaged outside consultants and adopted a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continued steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validated through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implemented a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting, and will need to continue to do so in the future.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by\nmaking it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u00b7\nestablish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u00b7\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nlimit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u00b7\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a stockholder rights plan, or so-called \u201cpoison pill,\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u00b7\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income of approximately $119.8 million and $111.0 million, respectively, which expire beginning in 2032. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code has previously occurred or has occurred as a result of our initial public offering or our subsequent September 2016 public offering. Our entire federal and state net operating loss carryforward is available for immediate use based on the IRC 382 analysis performed.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 15934, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AVXS"}
